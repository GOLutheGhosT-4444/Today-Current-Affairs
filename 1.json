Rangarajan. File\n                                          | Photo Credit: M. VEDHAN\nThe Sixteenth Finance Commission retains the share of States in the divisible pool at 41%, but it makes no recommendation on non-shareable cess and surcharge, which has been a concern for all States, C. Rangarajan, Former Chairman, Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister & Former Governor, RBI, and Chairman, Madras School of Economics, said.\nSpeaking at a one-day conference on the report of the Sixteenth Finance Commission that was organised by the Madras Institute of Development Studies (MIDS) in association with the Madras School of Economics (MSE), Mr. Rangarajan said: “This is unfortunate. The Sixteenth Finance Commission recommended a ‘grand bargain’ between the Centre and States, so that States would agree to a smaller share provided the Centre agreed to merge a large part of the cesses and surcharges in the regular taxes.”\n“It would have been better if the commission at least pointed out to the Centre that the steep increases in cesses and surcharges is not warranted and is not in the spirit of the Constitution,” he added.\nMr. Rangarajan then pointed out that the Sixteenth Finance Commission discontinued revenue deficit grants and sector specific grants and this will reduce the flow of resources from the centre to the States. “In the horizontal distribution, a new variable contribution to GDP has been added. This is not the variable contribution to total taxes of the Centre as demanded by several rich States. Using square root of States share in GDP reduces the impact of this variable,” he added.\n“There are difficulties in estimating revenue deficit grant but the Sixteenth Finance Commission took the short cut to dropping it altogether. Normatively determined revenue gap grants and appropriate equalisation grants have a place in federal structure,” Mr. Rangarajan explained.\nN.R. Bhanumurthy, director of MSE, said that there are some downside risks. “Increasing share of cesses and surcharges – Finance Commission could have set some limits on extent and use,” he said. He also said that under population criteria, missing the migration trends could go against some States.\nPublished - February 25, 2026 05:34 am IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Sreejith alleged that the Budget concealed moves to undermine Kochi’s flagship Samridhi project and to hand over the Corporation’s assets to private agencies and companies. He described the proposal to resume biomining at the scientifically capped site in Brahmapuram as suspicious.\nMr. Sreejith recalled that it was during the tenure of the United Democratic Front (UDF) that Brahmapuram was reduced to a waste mound, with crores of rupees squandered in the process. He stressed that transparency and clarity were essential in projects under the public-private partnership model.\nPrioritising Indira Canteen at the expense of Samridhi betrayed the UDF’s intolerance and political vendetta against a popular initiative. He also flagged ambiguity in the formation of the development council. Introducing new projects at a time when K-SMART had already been successfully implemented was questionable, he said.\nThe Budget, he said, failed to address the acute drinking water shortage faced by the city or to propose measures to tackle tidal flooding, a major challenge. He noted that during the strike by ASHA workers, the UDF had announced an increase in honorarium in local bodies where it was in power, but the Corporation’s Budget remained silent on the matter, exposing what he termed political hypocrisy.\nSeveral of the projects listed in the Budget, including municipal bonds, were not new, Mr. Sreejith said. Many had either been initiated or preliminary steps taken during the tenure of the previous council.\nPublished - February 25, 2026 01:08 am IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

A special account system will be introduced to ensure that funds raised are utilised exclusively for designated projects.\nThe bonds will be listed on stock exchanges in compliance with Securities and Exchange Board of India regulations. A high-power committee led by the Corporation secretary will be constituted to coordinate activities related to the municipal bond.\nThe Budget has proposed measures to increase the Corporation’s own revenue by 10%. A sub-committee will be constituted to oversee the initiative.\nTo plug tax leakages, all buildings within the Corporation limits will be mapped using modern technology. A system of authorised advertisement boards with QR codes will be introduced, and unauthorised boards will be removed and penalties imposed.\nProfession tax collection will be streamlined by preparing a list of liable individuals, and a special squad will be formed to ensure compliance. More staff will be deployed to inspect theatres, malls, hotels, amusement parks, and stadiums to strengthen collection of entertainment tax.\nA dedicated revenue recovery cell will be set up to ensure timely collection of non-tax revenues and arrears. The measures are expected to generate an additional ₹30 crore in revenue.\nThe Budget has proposed a comprehensive parking policy to ensure more efficient use of public spaces. The city will be divided into designated parking zones, with demand-based regulation introduced to manage congestion.\nParking facilities under the Corporation, Greater Cochin Development Authority, and Kochi Metro Rail Limited will be brought under a unified framework to ensure transparency. Priority will be given to scientific reorganisation of available spaces.\nAs part of the policy, roadside parking will be gradually regulated. A special cell will be constituted to monitor and coordinate its implementation. The project has been allocated ₹40 lakh.\nPublished - February 25, 2026 01:08 am IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

The application has been developed to enhance the operational efficiency of the police in crime detection, investigation, supervision, and data-driven policing by leveraging emerging technologies, an official release said. The DFCS enables digital collection, validation, and storage of fingerprint records.\n“This facilitates secure and efficient capture of all ten fingerprints including slab impressions, thumbs, and individual fingers using a biometric device which streamlines biometric data collection at police stations. This is a unique achievement of Tamil Nadu Police and is integrated with CCTNS 2.0,” it said.\nPublished - February 25, 2026 01:03 am IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Kanniah took up the issue with the Railway Board and succeeded in getting the proposal withdrawn. The administration had earlier informed the staff that the kilometre allowance and certain other allowances would not be paid for February owing to financial constraints, as the expenditure had exceeded the budgetary allocation for the current fiscal.\nDescribing the move as a matter of serious concern, SRMU, the largest employees’ union in the zone, said that withholding the kilometre allowance would have caused widespread anxiety among the staff. “The move was likely to affect staff morale and operational efficiency, potentially leading to disruptions in train services across Southern Railway,” said Paul Maxwell Johnson, Chennai divisional secretary of the union.\nAccording to him, Mr. Kanniah, who is also the president of the All India Railwaymen Federation, flagged the issue at the highest level, highlighting the essential and continuous nature of running staff duties and the direct operational impact of withholding a substantial portion of their earnings. “After sustained efforts and a constructive dialogue, the Railway Board agreed to withdraw the proposal, thereby safeguarding the legitimate earnings of running staff and ensuring uninterrupted train services,” Mr. Johnson said.\nMeanwhile, the All India Loco Running Staff Association submitted a memorandum to the Financial Adviser and Chief Accounts Officer of Southern Railway, stating that the kilometre allowance constitutes nearly 30% of the pay of Loco Pilots and Train Managers and is protected under the provisions of the Indian Railway Establishment Manual. It argued that non-payment of the allowance would effectively amount to a reduction in pay rather than mere withholding of an allowance.\n“No general or specific orders have been issued authorising a pay cut for any category of employees. In the absence of such instructions, curtailing the pay element of the crew alone is highly discriminatory and objectionable,” it said, adding that the sudden exclusion of the allowance from the salary bill had caused serious financial hardship and resentment among the staff.\nSouthern Railway had initially informed employees that around 12 allowances would not be paid for February.\nHowever, late on Monday evening, it was decided that only kilometre allowance, travel allowance, and overtime allowance would be withheld. When contacted on Tuesday evening, the zone’s official spokesperson said there was no further update.\nMeanwhile, the Southern Railway, in a post in X, said it was committed to the welfare of its employees. A delay of 10-15 days in payment of certain allowances “happens sometime due to late submission of claims by employees, calculation errors in claims on the part of employees or administrative reasons, etc.,” it said.\nPublished - February 25, 2026 12:04 am IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Legislators Sports Meet, the Sports Authority of A.P. (SAAP) has returned with its second edition this year in Vijayawada. The public gathered at the Indira Gandhi Municipal Corporation (IGMC) stadium on Tuesday to see their elected representatives exhibit their talent in the field of sports.\nThe MLAs and MLCs, clad in purple t-shirts, engaged in friendly games of tug of war, volleyball, kabaddi, atheletics on the first day of the sports meet. The audience cheered as the team led by A.P. Assembly Deputy Speaker K. Raghurama Krishna Raju defeated the team led by Assembly Speaker Ch. Ayyanna Patrudu in a single pull in the tug of war.\nEarlier, inaugurating the event in the evening, Mr. Ayyanna Patrudu said the competitions were being held to provide relief from the daily grind for legislators. “Legislators are under constant stress, outside and at home. Such events provide the much-needed break,” he said.\n“I was a first-time MLA when former Chief Minister late N.T. Rama Rao spoke about the necessity of organising such events. It continued for a few years then. It is a great pleasure to be resuming these events once again,” said Mr. Ayyanna Patrudu. He said that there would be a cultural programme and prize distribution ceremony on the last day of the Assembly sessions.\nLater, A.P. Legislative Council Chairman Koyye Moshen Raju pointed out that such events were important to maintain cordial relations among legislators.\nAfter the event was held last year, many legislators encouraged sportspersons and promoted sports back home in their constituencies, said SAAP Chairman A. Ravi Naidu.\nThis year, the competitions are being organised across 14 categories and also for different age groups. On the first day, in the men’s athletics (100 m) under-50 category, Parvathipuram MLA B. Vijay Chandra secured the first place. In the 50+ category, TDP State president Palla Srinivasa Rao emerged the winne.\nIn women’s athletics (100m) under-50 section, MLC Kavali Greeshma begged top position. The three-day event will conclude on February 26.\nPublished - February 25, 2026 12:03 am IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Hence, even though the investigation in the matter is ongoing, we have paid out 100% of the principal and interest ....which works out to a net amount of ₹583 crore,” the bank said in a filing with stock exchanges.\nAlso Read | RBI watching development around IDFC First Bank fraud, no systemic issue: Governor Malhotra\n“The departments have sincerely thanked and appreciated the bank for the positive approach, professional manner, and speedy and principle-based resolution,” it added.\nThe bank said it would work together with the relevant Haryana Government departments and the law enforcement agencies, to pursue actions against the ‘perpetrators of the fraud’ and ‘look forward to recovering our dues.’\nMeanwhile, broking firm Nomura in a report said the amount under reconciliation forms 28% of FY26 profit and 19 bps of the CET-1 ratio, which stood at 14.23% as of Dec. 25.\n“The exact impact to the bank’s financials will depend on potential recoveries made through the liens marked on fraudulent beneficiary accounts maintained with other banks, liabilities of entities involved in the transactions and the legal recovery process,” it said.\nOn its view it said, “While the issue appears localized, it raises concerns around governance and branch-level controls. We await clarity on the quantum of potential loss, recoveries, and provisioning stance.”\n“In deposit-linked frauds, banks usually protect depositors and recognize the loss through P&L once the fraud is established, leading to high/often full provisioning, whereas recoveries, if any, are generally back-ended (insurance, asset seizure, third-party liability),” the Japanese brokerage form said.\n“Given IDFC First Bank’s retail deposit-led model, reputational perception remains critical, and the stock could remain under pressure until forensic findings and the financial impact are clearly established,” it added.\nMotilal Oswal in a report said the impact could potentially dent 4QFY26 Profit Before Tax (PBT) by 56%.  “Basis findings and following the due procedures, the bank will look to make necessary provisions in the coming quarter. We believe that in a worst-case scenario assuming negligible recovery, the provisioning requirement will impact 4QFY26 PBT by 56%,” it said.\n“We look forward to get more clarity on these developments and potential recovery that may possibly happen as the authorities investigate the matter. We will review our numbers during the 4Q preview and in the interim, we maintain our Neutral rating on the stock,” it added.\nIn the exchange filing stating that it has high ratings from credit rating agencies, IDFC First Bank said its asset quality has been high and among the best in the industry.\n“The last few years have been a phase of building the foundation blocks, and the next few years we expect the operating leverage to reflect in the earnings, it stated.\n“As stated publicly, with the MFI (microfinance) situation behind us, we expect to be strongly back in trajectory of profits from FY’27 onwards. We are building a world-class bank in India with strong governance and ethics and will emerge stronger from this incident,” it added.\nThe bank’s stock on Tuesday gained 1.33% to close at ₹70.97 on the BSE.\nPublished - February 24, 2026 11:42 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Vijayendra\nBJP State president B.Y. Vijayendra has written to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah seeking withdrawal of a circular on restrictions on journalists at the Vidhana Soudha.\nIn the letter, Mr. Vijayendra objected to the DPAR’s circular which said that electronic media personnel should take bytes of Ministers and legislators only at a certain gate of the Vidhana Soudha and that only those with accreditation cards issued by the Information Department could enter the Vidhana Soudha.\nPointing out that many journalists do not have accreditation cards, Mr. Vijayendra demanded that entry must be provided to even those not having accreditation and also those from electronic media and YouTube channels. YouTube channels have been regarded as media/digital media today, he pointed out.\nStating that the circular had been issued out of security concerns, he maintained that “security can be tightened and made foolproof, but without hindering the media from doing their professional duties.”\n“This decision to ban entry of media into the Vidhana Soudha smacks of panic and jitters. It looks like that this decision has been made out of extraneous considerations,” he alleged.\n“We are living in a democracy. Transparency and accountability are the hallmark of any government. Let’s be transparent and accountable to the people. Let the media do its job, without any fear or favour. Let there be a healthy relationship between the media and the government on one side and media and legislators on the other side,” he said.\nPublished - February 24, 2026 10:46 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

It is a genuine demand. We will follow it up,” NC leader and legislator Tanvir Sadiq said.\nThe transfer of the hydropower projects remained “critical for the region”. “J&K should get its rights back. Return of NHPC projects is a genuine demand,” Mr. Sadiq said.\nPublished - February 24, 2026 10:40 pm IST\nrenewable energy\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Sasikala displaying the new party flag during public meeting near Pasumpon in Ramanathapuram district on February 24, 2026.\n                                          | Photo Credit: L. Balachandar\n\nDuring a public meeting in Kamuthi on Tuesday (February 24, 2026) to mark the birth anniversary of former Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa, her aide V.K. Sasikala announced her decision to launch a political party. She unveiled the party’s flag — featuring black, white, and red — which carries the portraits of former Chief Ministers C.N. Annadurai, M.G. Ramachandran (MGR), and Jayalalithaa.\nAddressing the gathering, Ms. Sasikala, who cannot contest the upcoming Assembly elections due to her disqualification under the Representation of People Act owing to her conviction in a corruption case, said her soon-to-be named party would follow the Dravidian path established by these three leaders. “The party would champion the cause of the poor and marginalised while eliminating both enemies and traitors,” she added.\nShe claimed she was returning to active politics as remaining silent any longer would be a betrayal to the people of Tamil Nadu and her party workers.\nShe took an indirect jab at former Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, saying she did not even wish to utter the name of the person who had “betrayed her” after coming to power.\n“I am the person who was by Amma’s (Jayalalitha) side, witnessing everything — the good and the bad. We were in the hospital for 72 days. We were even prepared to bring her back home on an auspicious day. But, in a way no one expected, she suddenly suffered a heart attack,” she said.\n“Yet look at the stories people on the outside fabricated. They even went as far as saying that I was the one who killed her,” Ms. Sasikala said.\nShe claimed during her incarceration in Bengaluru, several AIADMK ministers pressured her to move to a Chennai prison. She declined and wondered if she would have been alive had she agreed to the transfer.\n“I am telling the people of Tamil Nadu today what I haven’t revealed before. While I was in jail, Palaniswami troubled me daily. When the Bengaluru court granted me 15 days of parole to see my ailing husband, Palaniswami, as CM, allowed only 5 days with strict conditions,” she claimed.\n“I could not meet even relatives or the press, and I couldn’t stay at Poes Garden. Even when my husband died, the Palaniswami government gave me only 10 days instead of 16 to perform the rituals. Palaniswami is a man who stabbed the very person who seated him in power, both in the back and the face with a spear,” she said.\nPublished - February 24, 2026 10:25 pm IST\nTamil Nadu\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        state politics\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

This way, it will be possible to know how the number of households in each ward which are giving the garbage to the SAT vehicles, officials informed.\nGHMC Commissioner R.V. Karnan said that the QR code-based door-to-door waste collection system would enhance accountability and ensure daily collection of garbage from every household.\nOn Tuesday morning, the Commissioner inspected the implementation of the pilot project, accompanied by Zonal Commissioner Anurag Jayanti, Additional Commissioner (Sanitation) Ravi Kiran and others.\nThe Commissioner observed that Swachh Auto workers play a crucial role in transforming Greater Hyderabad into a clean city. He directed Deputy Commissioners and officials of the Solid Waste Management wing, including DEEs and AEs, to ensure that door-to-door garbage collection is carried out without fail every day across GHMC limits.\nOfficials were instructed to identify households that fail to hand over waste to Swachh Auto workers and motivate residents to participate in the system. Mr. Karnan warned that negligence in attendance, performance of sanitation workers and supervisory lapses would not be tolerated.\nHe also directed officials to respond promptly to complaints related to sanitation issues. Stressing the importance of public participation, the Commissioner called for awareness and outreach programmes to strengthen community involvement in cleanliness initiatives.\nOfficials stated that if the pilot project yields positive results, plans would be drawn up to implement the QR code-based waste collection system across GHMC limits.\nPublished - February 24, 2026 10:00 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

The BJP was not seeking the ouster of the government but wanted “democratic governance”. Despite alleged efforts by the Congress, Majlis and BRS, the BJP was able to get its candidate elected as Mayor in Karimnagar, he said, attributing this to a revolt among BRS corporators who “independently supported the BJP nominee”.\nThe Minister said the party was poised to perform well in municipal corporation elections and demanded that Chief Minister Revanth Reddy disclose details of funds released for infrastructure projects in the GHMC limits.\nMr. Sanjay Kumar alleged that while assets of MIM leaders were increasing, living conditions in the Old City remained unchanged. The BJP’s campaign for the GHMC elections would focus on the twin themes of “development and Hindutva”.\nIn a separate press conference at Nagarkurnool, Telangana BJP chief N. Ramchander Rao demanded an inquiry into the death of a two-month-old infant who died in an attack on a family belonging to a weaker section during the ‘Mallanna Jatara’ at Kummera village.\nMr. Rao, who met the grieving parents, urged the government to ensure immediate justice and announce ex-gratia for the family. He alleged that Chief Minister Revanth Reddy, who also holds the Home portfolio, had “lost grip over the administration”.\nPublished - February 24, 2026 09:50 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Many of these conditions are preventable through early and sustained interventions, especially by promoting informed food choices at the household level.\nThe initiative is aligned with the objectives of the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke, which calls for stronger preventive strategies and lifestyle modification to reduce disease burden.\nSpeaking on the occasion, Mr. Rao said heart disease, diabetes, stroke and kidney ailments are placing increasing pressure not only on individuals and families but also on the public health system. “Several of these illnesses can be prevented if we address unhealthy dietary practices in time,” he said, pointing out that excessive salt consumption remains a key concern.\nHe noted that food habits often take root early in life and continue due to lack of awareness and structured guidance.\nThe Minister said the government’s vision of a “Healthy Karnataka” rests on prevention, early action and people-centred care. In this effort, healthcare professionals — including doctors, nurses, counsellors and frontline workers — play a crucial role as they interact with communities on a daily basis and influence health-related behaviour.\nTo support them, the manual offers practical, evidence-based guidance that can be applied across primary, secondary and tertiary levels of care. It provides clear information on healthy diets, recommended salt intake, the risks associated with high sodium consumption, and actionable strategies to reduce salt use at the household and community levels. It also integrates structured dietary counselling into routine health services.\nMr. Rao expressed confidence that systematic use of the manual in training and regular service delivery would enhance community awareness, encourage healthier food practices and help prevent avoidable complications arising from NCDs.\nPublished - February 24, 2026 09:49 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

The proposed legislation will replace the Andhra Pradesh Ordinance No. 1 of 2026 and formally amend the existing Motor Vehicles Taxation Act.\nAccording to officials, the Bill seeks to insert a new Section 3-C titled “Levy of Road Safety Cess.” Under this provision, an additional 10% tax will be collected as Road Safety Cess on the life tax payable at the time of registration of motor vehicles in the State.\nThe government stated that the cess is intended to create a dedicated fund to strengthen road safety infrastructure, enhance enforcement mechanisms, and reduce accident-related fatalities and injuries. The proceeds are expected to support measures such as black spot rectification, improved road engineering standards, traffic management systems, and public awareness campaigns.\nThe Cabinet has approved the withdrawal of criminal prosecution and disciplinary proceedings initiated against Forest Department officials, Water Resources engineers and agencies involved in the 2014–19 “Neeru-Chettu” works.\nIt has approved extension of free travel benefits to Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) in buses covered under the ‘Stree Shakti’ scheme. The decision applies to those defined under Section 2(zc) of the RPWD Act, 2016, including individuals with 40% or more disability.\nThe Cabinet also cleared continuation of 50% fare concession in City Ordinary, Metro Express, Palle Velugu, Ultra Palle Velugu and Express services. The existing concessions in Non-Stop, Inter-State, Saptagiri Express and Ultra Deluxe buses will continue. Eligible PWDs and their escorts will be covered, with subsidy reimbursement to APSRTC and APPTD based on actual claims.\nThe Cabinet also cleared  proposals brought by the CRDA for development of infrastructure.\nPublished - February 24, 2026 09:47 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

The previous edition was conducted at the Orchard Combat Training Centre in Idaho, the U.S., in November 2024. The bilateral drill aims to increase interoperability, jointness, and exchange of special operations tactics, with a focus on operations in mountainous terrains.\nTraining activities will include intensive physical conditioning, joint mission planning, and the execution of tactical drills. Troops from both sides will exchange best practices and operational experiences in special operations, strengthening combined capabilities for complex missions, the Ministry said.\nMeanwhile, the Dharma Guardian exercise by the Indian Army and the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force is underway at the Foreign Training Node in Chaubattia, Uttarakhand, from February 24 to March 9. The exercise involves 120 personnel from each side, with Japan represented by troops from the 32nd Infantry Regiment, and India represented by the Ladakh Scouts.\nHeld alternately in India and Japan, Dharma Guardian enhances joint operational capabilities in a semi-urban environment. The two-week engagement will centre on physical endurance, coordinated planning, and synchronised tactical drills, incorporating modern technology and contemporary operational practices.\nBoth exercises reflect deepening military cooperation and growing strategic convergence between India and its key partners in the Indo-Pacific.\nPublished - February 24, 2026 09:44 pm IST\nmilitary equipment\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        security\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        security measures\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

He was apprehended by the Seshadripuram police in connection with an attempted theft at a nationalised bank in Seshadripuram and another attempt to steal cash from a private bank ATM within the limits of Halasuru Gate Police Station.\nThe accused allegedly gained entry into the bank through the ventilator located at the back of the building while the security guard on duty was stationed at the front during the early hours of Monday. The accused allegedly disconnected the CCTV connection and attempted to get into the strong room by cutting a wire to disable the security system which triggered an alarm.\nSensing trouble, the accused escaped without taking any valuables.\nA similar attempt was made on the same day at an ATM kiosk. According to the police, the accused allegedly targeted the bank and the ATM kiosk to repay his debts. During the interrogation, he is said to have confessed that mounting financial liabilities drove him to attempt the thefts.\nDeputy Commissioner of Police (Central Division) Akshay Hakay said that, considering the gravity of the offences, five special teams were formed to investigate the cases. The teams worked on various technical and field-level clues before zeroing in on the suspect and securing his arrest.\nThe accused was produced before the court and taken into police custody for further investigation to ascertain his criminal antecedents and to probe the possible involvement of others.\nMr. Hakay added that a coordination meeting will be held with bank officials to review existing security measures and strengthen systems to prevent such incidents in the future.\nPublished - February 24, 2026 09:43 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Basheer, secretary of the Kerala PSC Rank Holders Association, welcomed the decision. He said the decision widened the path to government employment for educated youth, especially those from marginalised sections of society, including minorities.\nThe change in age criteria is sure to help lakhs of PSC aspirants, according to K. Sebastian, president of the Kerala PSC Employees Union. He reasons that hundreds of people who drop out of the information technology sector in their mid- or late 30s are now seeking government jobs. “A good 60% of the candidates who clear the Secretariat Assistant examination are engineering graduates, and many of them seek employment in the government sector after trying out various other options. This is also sure to benefit those who seek employment after marriage or those looking for a second job or one with very few vacancies,” Mr. Sebastian points out.\nLanding a job through PSC at 40 doesn’t take away anything from them, as the pensionary age has been increased to 60 years for those who joined service after April 1, 2013, he says.\nLeader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan was not immediately available for comment.\nPublished - February 24, 2026 09:41 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Sridhar Babu on Tuesday said the Telangana government will soon roll out the Ease of Doing Business 2.0 policy as part of its strategy to position the State as a preferred global investment destination.\nThe policy would be developed through stakeholder consultations with the objective of accelerating industrial growth, strengthening investor confidence and providing greater assurance to investors, the Minister told GrowthX 2026 summit organised by the Federation of Telangana Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FTCCI) here.\nEmphasising that growth must be planned, he said the government had prepared the Telangana Vision 2047 to guide long-term economic expansion. The State, currently a $200-billion economy, aims to grow to $1 trillion by 2034 and $3 trillion by 2047. To achieve these goals and ensure balanced regional development, the government has adopted a three-pronged strategy of CURE, PURE and RARE under which every region, from urban centres to rural areas, will be placed on the growth path.\nWith technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Industry 5.0 reshaping work culture and business models, future competitiveness would depend on strong ecosystems rather than individual companies. The State government seeks to function not merely as a regulatory authority granting approvals, but as a collaborative partner working alongside industry, Mr. Sridhar Babu said.\nFTCCI president R. Ravi Kumar said that while industry appreciates the government’s efforts toward improving EoDB, the cost of doing business continues to rise and needs attention.\nBJP State president N.

The local body also targets a comprehensive overhaul of its solid waste management system and steps to address the stray dog menace.\nThe Budget is the first one to be presented by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) since coming into power in the Corporation for the first time.\nDeputy Mayor G.S. Asha Nath, who presented the Budget on Tuesday, announced the Pradhan Mantri Bhavana Yojana (PMBY) housing scheme for which a significant allocation of ₹20 crore has been made. She claimed that the initiative is bound to benefit nearly 2,000 people who are being denied housing in the Corporation limits due to the stubbornness of the State government to implement the Centrally-sponsored Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY).\nBesides, an allocation of ₹50 lakh has been made to ensure the coverage of PMBY among transgender beneficiaries.\nIn order to enhance waste management efforts, the Corporation will introduce modern technology-driven processing systems similar to those adopted in cities such as Varanasi, Goa and Indore. The local body will also intensify its stray dog rehabilitation measures by establishing more shelters in coordination with Central animal welfare authorities.\nMultiple medical service projects will be introduced in association with HLL Lifecare Ltd. The Corporation will establish ‘Amruth pharmacies’ to provide medicines at discounts up to 50%. ‘Prime Health laboratories’ will also be introduced for medical diagnoses at discounted rates up to 40%. Sample collection centres will be set up at 50 centres for the purpose. Allocations of ₹1.5 crore each have been made for both proposals.\nYet another allocation of ₹1.5 crore has been set aside to establish a Comprehensive Diagnostic Centre that will provide high-end facilities including CT scanning, MRI, ultrasound scanning, X-ray and mammography at discounted rates up to 50%.\n‘Atal Canteens’ will be established in various parts of the city at an outlay of ₹2 crore to provide meals for ₹20.\nAn international office will be established with an allocation of ₹1 crore to manage partnerships and collaborations with international agencies and global institutions that handle matters related to expatriates. The office will give shape to ‘city-to-city’ partnerships, undertake projects like ‘City of Peace’ and global conferences including ‘Thiruvananthapuram Global Peace Summit 2027-28’.\nAn ‘Office for Night Economy’ is being established to oversee, regulate and promote a safe and vibrant nightlife in the city. This office will coordinate night-time activities in collaboration with the police, security agencies and private businesses. An amount of ₹10 lakh has been set aside for the purpose.\nA language training centre will be established with an outlay of ₹15 lakh to provide training in Indian languages and foreign languages such as German, English and French in collaboration with the NoRKA Institute of Foreign Languages.\nThe administrative activities of the Corporation will soon be made paperless. Modern facilities will be acquired to prepare agenda, reports and decisions of council meetings available in the digital format.

Koshy Commission appointed to study the educational, economic, and welfare issues of Christian minorities in Kerala.\nTuesday’s Cabinet meeting, which finalised decisions on 32 more recommendations, also decided to publish the report.\nA major decision taken on Tuesday pertains to the issuance of community cerificates to Latin Catholics. The year 1947 will henceforth not be a criterion for issuing the caste/community certificate. At present, only those members of the Latin Catholic Community who were born before 1947 and their descendants were eligible for the certificate.\nThis condition has now been evaluated as unscientific. Henceforth, certificates issued by the Bishops concerned will be regarded as a supporting document for verification by revenue officials and the local inspection by village officer for issuing the community certificate.\nReacting to Tuesday’s development, the Kerala Latin Catholic Association (KLCA) welcomed the government decision to publish the commission report. It reflects partial fulfiment of the KLCA efforts to get the report published and the recommendations implemented after discussions with stakeholders, KLCA State president Sherry J. Thomas said.\nPublished - February 24, 2026 09:25 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Cheepurupalli MLA Kala Venkata Rao also visited the venue and offered a few suggestions to the officials.\nMinister for MSME Kondapalli Srinivas and other public representatives will hold a meeting in a few days to ensure foolproof arrangements for the Chief Minister’s meeting. The selection of Cheepurupalli constituency for the meeting assumes significance as YSRCP senior leader and opposition leader of the Legislative Council Botsa Satyanarayana represented the constituency thrice. Mr. Satyanarayana has been holding review meetings to strengthen the party ahead of local body elections. In this background, the Chief Minister will visit Cheepurupalli constituency and hold a meeting with TDP leaders after completion of the official programmes.\nPublished - February 24, 2026 09:16 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Nithin\nDeputy Mayor Deepak Joy presented his maiden Budget for the Kochi Corporation amid stiff protests by the Opposition Left Democratic Front (LDF) councillors against the alleged leakage of budgetary figures to the media ahead of the Budget presentation.\nHowever, Mayor V.K. Minimol stood her ground, claiming that the Budget presentation was within legal bounds, citing Sections 287 and 293 of the Kerala Municipal Act. She reasoned that the statute is devoid of any specific clause insisting on Budget secrecy, even as she reiterated the argument that the data became public due to the mandatory uploading of the finance committee-approved agenda on K-Smart portal. Corporation secretary P.S. Shibu corroborated the Mayor’s argument even as he observed that keeping figures confidential until the presentation was a long-standing tradition followed by previous councils.\nThe Opposition councillors, however, were not convinced and intensified their protest by descending into the well of the council hall, raising placards and sat right in front of the Mayor’s dais. Undeterred, Ms. Minimol invited her deputy to start the Budget presentation, which he did amid Opposition upheaval.\nLater, addressing the media, Ms. Minimol said the Budget was designed to accelerate urban growth, ensure socio-economic security, protect the environment, energise the cultural sphere, and strengthen infrastructure. A Budget monitoring mechanism has been proposed to oversee the implementation of projects. Mr. Joy was also present.\nThe ₹132.96-crore surplus Budget for the 2026-27 fiscal projected a revenue of ₹1,388.13 crore and expenditure of ₹1,255.16 crore.  As soon as the session got underway, LDF Parliamentary Party leader V.A. Sreejith raised a point of order condemning the alleged leak as an affront to the council’s dignity and privilege.\nThe Budget proposes a long-term vision of sustainable urban development over the next 25 years. Priority has been accorded to infrastructure development, social welfare, environmental protection, sustainable growth, cultural initiatives, and economic advancement. Recognising the financial constraints, the Budget proposed resource mobilisation through municipal bonds, green bonds, and technological innovations to enhance revenue. An economic advisory committee will be constituted to guide fiscal planning.\nA city-specific urban policy and development framework will be prepared. Public-private partnership models will be leveraged for funding. A Greater Kochi Development Council has also been proposed.\nThe Budget also proposed five major infrastructure projects — Edappally convention centre, a commercial complex at Kacheripady, an office-cum-commercial complex at Vyttila, and the Kaloor city centre — with a combined allocation of ₹180 crore.\nPublished - February 24, 2026 09:10 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

The dispute began over repair work, when dust from an air conditioner installation fell onto the couple’s floor.\nPolice registered a first information report under Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita Sections 79 (word intended to insult a woman’s modesty), 351(2) (criminal intimidation), 3(5) (common intention) and 196 (promoting enmity on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc.).\n\n\nSpeaking to ANI, Singh said he and his wife were “definitely ashamed\" of the incident, adding that the remarks were made in the heat of the moment.\nHe said they were cooperating fully with Delhi Police and had faith in the police and the Indian judiciary. He urged social media users to listen to both sides and asked for no media trials.\nSingh alleged that his property was being attacked and that one of his men was about to be attacked. He said the situation escalated after one of the women came forward. He added that he and his wife would accept any punishment given by the court.\nHe also said he was receiving obscene images of his mother on social media and requested that his family and profession not be dragged into the matter.

One of the women said they defended him, stating he was only carrying out work at their home.\nThe argument escalated and the couple also called the police.

I am not such a person, but it was in the heat of the moment. We did not intend to do so,\" Singh said in a video statement, adding that he would accept whatever punishment the law decides after an impartial probe.\nThe controversy arose from an altercation in south Delhi’s Malviya Nagar, where three women from Arunachal Pradesh alleged that they were subjected to racial slurs, humiliation and intimidation by their neighbours following a dispute over repair work at their rented apartment.\nAccording to police, the incident took place on February 20 around 3.30 pm, when the women had called an electrician to their fourth-floor flat to install an air conditioner.\nDuring drilling, dust and debris reportedly fell into the apartment below, prompting objections from Singh and his wife, Ruby Jain. What began as a disagreement over the falling debris soon escalated into a heated exchange.\nThe women alleged that the couple hurled abuses and made derogatory, racist remarks aimed at them and the wider northeastern community.\nA video of the confrontation, now widely circulated on social media, appears to show the accused using slurs such as “momo\" and making offensive allegations that the women worked at massage parlours.\nIn the footage, a police officer is also seen attempting to calm both sides as the argument intensified.\nIn parts of the video, the accused woman is allegedly heard making further offensive comments and asserting social and economic superiority, while the complainants are seen strongly objecting to the remarks and demanding accountability.\nThe women have claimed they were called “gutter-chaap,\" told to “go and sell momos,\" and subjected to other humiliating comments.\nPolice said an FIR has been registered against Harsh Singh and Ruby Jain, and the matter is under investigation.\nSingh, in his statement, appealed against “media trials\" and said his family members were being harassed online, adding that he personally apologised to people from the Northeast.\nThe complainants, meanwhile, have demanded a formal apology, stating that the remarks were not just a personal insult but an attack on the dignity of the northeastern community as a whole.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "The ‘India AI Impact Summit 2026’ brought together policymakers and technology leaders from across the world, spotlighting how artificial intelligence is reshaping governance, economies, and societies.\nAmong the global voices in attendance was Bolivia, a country rich in natural resources and increasingly focused on leveraging science, technology, and innovation to drive sustainable and inclusive development.\nOn the sidelines of the summit, CNN-News18 had a chat with Omar Alfredo Peñaloza Escalera, who is the vice-minister of science and technology at the ministry of development planning in Bolivia. He spoke about La Paz’s growing engagement with India, the promise of South-South cooperation in emerging technologies, and how partnerships in AI can help build domestic capacity rather than deepen global inequalities.\nExcerpts from the interview:\nMinister, Bolivia has traditionally focused on extractive industries and basic technology sectors. How does participation in the India AI Impact Summit fit into Bolivia’s broader science and technology strategy?\nBolivia’s participation in the India AI Impact Summit reflects our broader policy of steadily strengthening science, technology, and innovation as key drivers of sustainable development. We are committed to transforming our productive sectors by adopting emerging technologies, diversifying the economy, and creating greater value.\nIndia is a strategic partner from the Global South, with a strong track record in digital innovation and inclusive technological solutions. Our presence here shows Bolivia’s intent to learn from successful models, encourage knowledge exchange, and build partnerships that ultimately improve the lives of our people.\nArtificial intelligence can deepen global inequalities if mismanaged. How is Bolivia ensuring that Al collaborations with India will build domestic capacity rather than create dependency?\nBolivia views international cooperation as a partnership built on mutual respect, complementarity, and joint capacity-building. In the field of AI, our focus is on developing human talent, ensuring technology transfer, and strengthening institutions.\nThe goal is to create solutions tailored to Bolivia’s own realities, while promoting technological sovereignty and responsible data governance. Our cooperation with India is designed to build domestic capacity, not dependency, so that the benefits of AI support inclusive and sustainable development.\nAdvanced AI relies heavily on high-performance chips and semiconductors. Does Bolivia plan to collaborate with India on developing or accessing AI hardware?\nWe recognise the strategic importance of technological infrastructure for advancing AI. Bolivia is open to exploring cooperation mechanisms that improve access to advanced computing capabilities, encourage technical knowledge-sharing, and enable participation in initiatives linked to specialised AI hardware.\nFrom a complementary partnership perspective, we see opportunities to deepen dialogue in areas of shared interest, including technology innovation connected to strategic resources and the strengthening of technical capabilities in emerging sectors.\nFinally, during your visit to India and interactions with Indian counterparts, what were your key takeaways?\nThe visit highlighted the remarkable dynamism of India’s technology ecosystem and its strong commitment to using innovation as a tool for inclusion and development. It also reinforced the value of South-South cooperation as an effective way to tackle shared challenges.\nWe especially appreciated the openness and willingness of our Indian counterparts to expand collaboration in areas such as applied AI, digital transformation of public services, and institutional strengthening. We leave with a strong sense that this relationship can grow into a long-term strategic partnership built on trust, respect, and mutual benefit.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday hit back at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over his defence of the shirtless protest at the AI Impact Summit, with Union Minister Pralhad Joshi accusing the Congress of hypocrisy and being “far away from reality\".\nResponding to Gandhi’s remarks justifying the Indian Youth Congress’ shirtless protest during a high-profile AI summit, Joshi said attempts to label the disruption as a “peaceful protest\" were aimed at hiding irresponsible conduct that embarrassed India on a global stage.\nIn a post on X, the minister said such actions stood in sharp contrast to Congress’ repeated claims of patriotism.\n“The statements made attempting to justify the disgraceful disruption at Bharat Mandapam only expose the contradiction and hypocrisy at the core of Congress politics,\" Joshi said.\nHe added that the reaction of ordinary people present at the venue should serve as a reminder to the party that it was disconnected from ground realities.\nJoshi further alleged that while the Congress speaks of patriotism, it repeatedly creates situations that harm India’s image internationally.\n“This is not democracy. It is one party acting against the interests of the country simply because it is not in power,\" he said, accusing the Congress of having no clear roadmap, policy direction or positive agenda for the youth.\nThe BJP’s response came after Gandhi defended the protest during a public address in Bhopal, where he praised Youth Congress members as “fearless lions\" and described them as carrying the “blood of patriotism\".\nHis remarks were aimed at countering criticism over the disruption that took place at Bharat Mandapam on February 20, when the AI impact summit was underway.\nMeanwhile, Delhi Police have arrested Indian Youth Congress (IYC) national president Uday Bhanu Chib in connection with the incident. Police sources said Chib was questioned before being formally taken into custody, taking the total number of arrests in the case to eight.\nOn Monday, three other IYC members, Jitendra Yadav, Raja Gujar and Vimal Ajay Kumar, were also arrested, while four others had been detained earlier.\nAccording to police, the incident occurred around 12.30 pm inside a hall hosting the AI Impact Expo.\nThe protesters had completed online registration and entered the venue using QR codes.\nOnce inside, they allegedly removed their outer clothing, staged a shirtless protest, raised slogans and displayed politically charged messages on their T-shirts, including slogans targeting the Prime Minister.\nLatest Blogs",

The draft ‘Responsible business conduct amendment directions, 2026,’ mandates that all banks must ensure that they do not have any dark patterns by July 2026.\nAs consumers navigate through dark patterns and the responsive regulator RBI tries to get them resolved, LocalCircles has conducted a nationwide survey to find out how much consumers are affected and whether they are more aware of what the dark patterns are.\nThe survey received over 161,000 responses from users of online banking services located in 388 districts of India. 67% respondents were men while 33% respondents were women. 44% of respondents were from tier 1, 30% from tier 2 and 26% respondents were from tier 3, 4 and rural districts.\n\n\nAs increasing number of consumers use online banking services, the survey asked, “How often have you experienced with online banking platforms that during checkout or transaction finalization, additional charges (e.g., convenience fees, insurance, alerts, or services) were added without your clear consent or without being pre-disclosed?\"\nOut of 17,991 who responded to the question 27% stated they have “very frequently\" experienced during checkout or transaction finalization that additional charges were added without clear consent or without being pre-disclosed; 30% of respondents stated it has happened “sometimes\"; 6% of respondents stated “rarely\" have they experienced it; 37% of respondents stated they have “never\" experienced it.\nTo sum up, 57% of online banking users surveyed say that they experienced basket sneaking with online banking platforms where during checkout or transaction finalization additional charges are added with their clear consent or without being pre-disclosed.\n\n\nOnline banking users often face the issue of being persistently urged to subscribe to new services or products which don’t come free of charge.

In the case of minor girls, 12,113 went missing, and 10,295 were found.\nWhile police have managed to trace a large number of missing persons, thousands remain unaccounted for each year.

He told her that he will eat at home and is expected to land in Delhi at 9pm. She kept waiting till 11pm for Vikas to come. It was only then that we found out about the crash,\" he said.\nOperated by Delhi-based Redbird Airways Pvt Ltd, the Beechcraft C90 aircraft VT-AJV took off from Ranchi at 7.11pm with a patient on board. After take-off, the plane made contact with Kolkata but around 7.34pm, it lost communications and RADAR contact.\nSP Sumit Kumar, speaking to ANI, said: “We got information around 10pm that an accident has happened… Getting here was difficult considering the terrain… The Delhi team will come here for investigation and try to recover the black box… Total number of deaths is seven.\"\nHeart-wrenching stories have come to the fore from the crash. For instance, the family of Shaw, the patient being transported in the ambulance, had taken a loan of around Rs 8 lakh to hire the aircraft that crashed shortly after taking off.\nShaw had suffered 65 per cent burns last Monday after an electric short circuit at his restaurant in Chandwa triggered a fire. As his condition deteriorated, the family decided to shift him to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in New Delhi for advanced care. As a journey by road was not possible for Shaw, the family had borrowed around Rs 8 lakh from friends and relatives for an air ambulance.\n“Our home has been destroyed. Not just one home, many families have been ruined. If proper treatment had been available in Ranchi itself, we would not have had to take him to Delhi. And in the process of taking him to Delhi, this tragedy happened, our very existence has been shattered,\" Shaw’s relatives said.\nAnother life lost in the crash was of Vikas Kumar Gupta, the doctor on board the aircraft. Speaking to the media, Gupta’s father spoke about the sacrifices he made to educate his son.\n“My elder son was posted in Sadar Hospital, Ranchi. If there had been proper health facilities here, why would they have gone to Delhi for treatment? I had sold my farmland and other things for his education,\" he told ANI.\nThe Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) condoled the incident and launched a probe into the crash. A team from the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) also visited the site to recover the black box and find the exact cause behind the crash.\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "Govt Set To Roll Out Nationwide Free HPV Vaccination For Girls Aged 14-15 Years | Exclusive",
        "content": "The Union government is preparing to roll out a nationwide Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination campaign within a week, aimed at reducing the burden of cervical cancer among young women in India, government sources familiar with the development have told News18.\nThe campaign will provide MSD’s Gardasil 4 HPV vaccine free of cost to eligible beneficiaries through government health facilities across the country. In the private market, the vaccine costs around Rs 4,000 per dose.\nGardasil 4 protects against four HPV strains—6, 11, 16 and 18. “Of these, strains 16 and 18 are considered high-risk and are responsible for nearly 83 per cent of cervical cancer cases in India. Globally, these strains are responsible for over 70 per cent of cases,\" a senior official familiar with the development said, while explaining why the Centre has chosen Gardasil vaccine. “This initiative represents a decisive step towards eliminating cervical cancer, one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among women in the country.\"\nUnder the proposed rollout plan, a single-dose schedule will be followed. “WHO’s SAGE panel as well as India’s top panels on vaccination have approved the single-dose usage of Gardasil considering it to be equally effective to double or multi-dose vaccine.\"\nCervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women in India, with over 78,000 new cases and 42,000 deaths reported in 2024. The campaign will run in campaign mode for 90 days, followed by integration into routine immunisation days.\nWho Is Eligible And Where To Go?\nThe vaccination process will be integrated with the U-WIN digital platform, similar to the CoWIN system used during the Covid-19 vaccination drive. From slot booking to certification, the entire process is likely to be digitised.\nThe campaign will primarily target girls in the 14 to 15 age group. “Those who have just turned 14 will remain eligible until they turn 15. In addition, girls who turn 15 at the time of launch will be allowed a three-month window to receive the vaccine. The vaccine will be available free of cost only within this eligibility bracket,\" the source quoted above said.\n“The campaign will target 14-year-old girls across India, covering an annual cohort of approximately 1.15 crore girls each year. Vaccination will be provided free of cost, voluntary, and administered only with parental consent,\" he said.\nVaccinations will be administered at all government health facilities, including Ayushman Mandirs, government medical colleges, district hospitals, primary and community health centres. Each vaccination team will include a vaccinator, mobiliser, verifier, and volunteer.\nAll sessions will be linked to 24×7 health facilities for AEFI (Adverse Events Following Immunization) management, with helplines available for parental queries. “Health workers across 36 states and Union Territories have been trained for the rollout, with doctors and trained healthcare staff overseeing implementation.\"\nWho Is Supplying The Vaccine & How Safe Is It?\nOn the supply front, Gavi has committed to providing 2.6 crore doses of Gardasil between 2025 and 2027. Of these, around 1.5 crore doses have already reached India. The government officials estimate that India requires approximately 1.15 crore doses annually to cover girls turning 14 each year.\n“Since the introduction of Gardasil in 2006, over 50 crore doses have been administered worldwide, with no serious safety concerns reported except rare cases of anaphylaxis,\" the official quoted above said.\nThe vaccine is non-live, recombinant, and cannot cause HPV infection.\n“HPV vaccines are 93-100 per cent effective in preventing cervical cancer. Global studies, including trials in Kenya and Costa Rica, confirm that a single-dose schedule provides protection comparable to two or three doses, with efficacy sustained for over a decade,\" the official explained.\nHPV Campaign On PM Modi’s Radar\nThe government’s intent to expand access to HPV vaccination had earlier been articulated at the highest level. In an interaction with philanthropist Bill Gates, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said: “In the coming days, I want to talk about cervical cancer, especially for our daughters. I want to give a budget to our scientists in India… and with very little money, I want to vaccinate all the daughters in my country so that they are protected from cancer. I am working in that direction these days.\"\nThe broader policy push was also highlighted by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman during her Interim Budget 2024–25 speech, where she stated, “Our government will encourage vaccination for girls in the age group of 9 to 14 years to prevent cervical cancer.\"\nThe upcoming rollout, if implemented as planned, would mark one of the largest adolescent vaccination drives focused specifically on cancer prevention in the country.\nLatest Blogs",

On January 2, 2026, Bhiwandi City Police registered a case related to illegal gutkha activities and arrested three accused. In Vasai-Virar, five offences were registered in 2025. Six people were arrested and gutkha worth Rs 3.84 lakh was seized in those cases.\nGutkha remains banned in Maharashtra under food safety laws because of its serious health risks, including cancer and other oral diseases. Despite the ban, demand for the product has not fully disappeared. This keeps enforcement agencies on constant alert.\nThe government said police and food safety officials are conducting regular raids and checks across districts. Officials maintain that strict action will continue to curb the circulation of banned tobacco products and break supply networks operating within the state.\nLatest Blogs",

In addition, he expects each minister to share some “good news\" during the meeting — either related to their ministry’s performance or from their personal lives.\nAccording to sources, ministers often highlight notable achievements of their departments as part of this informal segment. These may include major policy outcomes, administrative successes, or initiatives that have positively impacted citizens. On some occasions, inspiring accounts are shared to motivate fellow Cabinet members. In one such instance, a senior minister reportedly spoke about reviving a loss-making public sector undertaking within months and steering it towards a profit of Rs 100 crore.\nPersonal milestones have also found mention during these interactions. Last year, Civil Aviation Minister Kinjarapu Rammohan Naidu informed the Prime Minister and Cabinet colleagues that he had been blessed with a baby boy. The whole team burst into laughter and congratulations for the real “good news\".\nOn another occasion, Union Minister CR Patil told the Cabinet about the action taken by his ministry to correct the flaws of Jal Jeevan Mission which was lauded by all.\nMinisters from key portfolios such as power, water resources, roads and highways, health, railways, education, and information technology frequently share updates on decisions that have brought tangible improvements in the lives of ordinary citizens.\nSources indicate that the Prime Minister’s initiative is aimed at fostering a culture of positive reinforcement within the Cabinet, encouraging ministers to focus on citizen-centric outcomes and set new benchmarks in governance. Typically, this “good news\" exchange takes place during the informal segment of the meeting, after the formal agenda has been concluded.\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "India's First Prime Minister Wasn't Jawaharlal Nehru, Here's What Happened In 1915",
        "content": "Long before the midnight tryst with destiny in 1947, when Jawaharlal Nehru took oath as independent India’s first Prime Minister, a bold but largely forgotten experiment in self-rule had already been attempted far from home.\nIn the middle of the First World War, on December 1, 1915, a group of Indian revolutionaries proclaimed the formation of the Provisional Government of India in Kabul, staking a claim to complete independence decades before it was realised.\n\n\nAt the height of World War I, with the British Empire deeply engaged on multiple fronts, revolutionaries sought to internationalise their struggle. In Kabul, they announced what they described as the first “Provisional Government of India\" (Hukumat-e-Mukhtara-e-Hind), an exile administration aimed at rallying global support against British rule.\nThe government was led by two prominent figures. Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh was declared President, while Maulana Barkatullah, also known as Barkatullah Bhopali, became Prime Minister. Maulana Ubaidullah Sindhi, a noted scholar associated with Deoband, was appointed Home Minister.\nRaja Mahendra Pratap had travelled widely to secure support for India’s cause and met Germany’s Kaiser Wilhelm II during the war. With German backing, he reached Afghanistan, then seen as a strategic gateway to India’s northwest frontier. Kabul offered both symbolic and geopolitical significance, a base outside direct British control, yet close enough to signal intent.\nMaulana Barkatullah, a scholar and seasoned political activist, had earlier campaigned for India’s freedom in countries including the United States and Japan. In Kabul, he worked to articulate the government’s position to foreign powers and mobilise diplomatic recognition. The administration reportedly received assurances of support from countries aligned against Britain, including Germany and the Ottoman Empire. There were even discussions about issuing independent Indian passports and postage stamps, powerful symbols of sovereignty.\nHistorians note that the Kabul government’s objective was clear: to demonstrate that Indians were prepared to govern themselves and to seek international backing for an armed uprising against the British, leveraging the global conflict. Letters were sent to rulers and heads of state across Asia and Europe, urging them to support India’s liberation.\nAlthough the experiment was short-lived, the end of World War I and shifting diplomatic alignments undercut its prospects; it marked one of the earliest organised attempts to establish an alternative Indian state structure in exile. Raja Mahendra Pratap was later nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, and Barkatullah continued advocating for India’s independence abroad until his death.\nIn Bhopal, Barkatullah University stands as a tribute to the revolutionary scholar. In 2013, the Government of India also issued a commemorative postage stamp in his honour.\n\n\nParallel to the Kabul initiative was a covert operation that came to be known as the Silk Handkerchief Movement, or the Silk Letter Conspiracy. After the formation of the provisional government, Maulana Ubaidullah Sindhi devised a secret method of communication between Indian revolutionaries and foreign allies such as Turkey.\nMessages were written in Persian on pieces of yellow silk cloth rather than paper, making them easier to conceal and more durable. These silk letters were stitched into garments or carried discreetly across borders by trusted couriers. The plan aimed to coordinate a broader armed revolt within India with assistance from powers hostile to Britain.\nHowever, in 1916, British intelligence intercepted some of these communications. Several leaders were arrested, and the conspiracy was effectively dismantled before it could translate into a full-scale uprising.\n\n\nDecades later, as constitutional reforms began reshaping British India, another lesser-known political milestone unfolded in the provinces. Under the Government of India Act, 1935, provincial elections were held in 1937. Although the Indian National Congress secured majorities in several provinces, including Bihar, it initially declined to form governments over concerns about the sweeping powers retained by colonial governors.\nIn Bihar, the Muslim Independent Party was invited to form the ministry. Muhammad Yunus became the province’s Premier, a title often referred to at the time as Prime Minister. He assumed office in April 1937 and served for 109 days until July 19 that year.\nBorn on May 4, 1884, in Panhara village near Patna, Muhammad Yunus came from a family of legal professionals. His father, Maulvi Ali Hasan Mukhtar, was a noted lawyer, and Yunus followed in his footsteps before entering politics.\nThese parallel stories, of an exile government in Kabul during a global war, a secret silk-letter network spanning continents, and a short-lived provincial premier in Bihar, underscore the diverse and international dimensions of India’s freedom struggle.\nLatest Blogs",

Police identified the deceased as Aish Vishwanath Amin, who was found hanging at his residence in the Tisgaon Naka area of Kalyan East on Sunday evening.\nA suicide note discovered at the scene indicated that Amin was experiencing severe mental distress and was worried he might have rabies following a dog bite a few days earlier. According to authorities, Amin lived with his elderly parents and brother in an apartment and had been employed at a cooperative bank for over eight years.\nFamily members informed the police that Amin had only received one anti-rabies injection after the incident.

He was rushed to a civic hospital in Mumbai, where he passed away on January 30.\nA doctor from IGM Hospital stated that the boy received anti-rabies and tetanus injections during his first visit.

I am not being allowed to speak on issues that concern them,\" the Congress MLC said during the meeting, triggering a sharp response from the minister.\nSantosh Lad, who is also the district in-charge minister, countered the allegation, insisting that all members were being given sufficient opportunity to present their views.\nAs tempers flared, Lad was heard telling the MLC, “There is no need to argue. Don’t speak like this. If you want to leave the meeting, you may.\"\nThe exchange briefly disrupted the review meeting before senior officials and party leaders stepped in to defuse the situation and restore order.\nSantosh Lad, a senior Congress leader, represents the Kalghatgi-Alnavar constituency in Dharwad district and currently serves as a cabinet minister in the Siddaramaiah government.\nJakkappanavar, who has held positions linked to SC welfare bodies, has been vocal on issues concerning social justice and representation.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "In a significant move aimed at easing access to long-pending provident fund savings, the Ministry of Labour and Employment has decided to roll out a pilot exercise to refund money lying in inactive EPF accounts directly to beneficiaries.\nAs per Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) rules, any account that does not record a transaction for three consecutive years is classified as inoperative.\nAccording to available data, there are 31.86 lakh inoperative accounts, collectively holding Rs 10,903 crore. Of these, around 7.11 lakh accounts fall in the Rs 0–Rs 1,000 category, amounting to Rs 30.52 crore.\nUnder the pilot phase, funds worth approximately Rs 650 crore will be credited to nearly six lakh such inactive accounts. Government sources indicate that the transfers are expected to be completed within the next month, with the money being deposited directly into the bank accounts linked to these holdings.\nALSO READ: EPF Withdrawal Via UPI Soon? 5 Things Subscribers Should Know\nThe benefit will initially cover Aadhaar-linked accounts. For inactive accounts that are not yet linked to Aadhaar, the Ministry has directed its state offices to expedite the seeding process to enable seamless transfers.\nSources said the government observed that several accounts, even those holding small sums, have remained inactive as account holders were reluctant to initiate withdrawals due to cumbersome procedures. In many instances, individuals seeking to withdraw as little as Rs 1,000 were required to make multiple visits to EPF offices and complete extensive paperwork. Additionally, such inoperative accounts do not accrue interest, further disadvantaging subscribers.\nThe pilot is aimed at ensuring that funds parked in inactive accounts reach beneficiaries without procedural hurdles, leveraging the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) mechanism to simplify the process.\nFollowing the pilot’s successful implementation, the government plans to institutionalise a system for timely transfers of funds from inactive EPF accounts, ensuring quicker access and improved financial inclusion for subscribers.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "Haryana Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini on Monday said the state government acted swiftly after irregularities were noticed in the alleged Rs 590 crore fraud linked to certain Haryana government accounts at the Chandigarh branch of IDFC FIRST Bank.\nSaini said the government was proactive in identifying discrepancies in certain accounts.\n“When some glitches were noted, we asked for statements, and those, too, did not match. Therefore, the government decided to transfer all the money to an authorised bank, along with interest,\" the Chief Minister said. He added that the funds are completely safe and assured that the money will be recovered.\nThe Haryana CM said IDFC FIRST Bank had written to SEBI in its defence, stating that an employee was at fault. However, the state government has referred the matter to the Anti-Corruption Bureau and the Vigilance Department to examine the seriousness of the case.\n“The investigation is going on.

The development was disclosed in a regulatory filing by the bank.\nIn its statement, the bank said an initial internal review found that the issue was restricted to a specific set of government-linked accounts handled at the Chandigarh branch and did not affect other customers.\nIt noted that the total amount currently under reconciliation in the identified accounts is around Rs 590 crore. The final financial impact, the bank added, will depend on further verification of claims, possible recoveries — including action against beneficiary accounts in other banks — liabilities of other entities involved, and the outcome of legal proceedings.\nThe bank confirmed that four officials suspected of involvement have been suspended pending investigation.\nIt also said it would initiate strict disciplinary, civil and criminal proceedings against employees and any external individuals found responsible, in accordance with the law. Efforts to recover the funds through legal channels are under way.\nHaryana Government Takes Action\nAfter the disclosure, Haryana’s Finance Department (Institutional Finance & Credit Control) announced that it has de-empanelled IDFC FIRST Bank and AU Small Finance Bank for all government-related transactions with immediate effect.\nAccording to an official statement, no government funds will be deposited, invested or routed through these banks until further notice.\nAll departments, boards, corporations and public sector undertakings have been directed to shift their balances to authorised banks and close existing accounts with the two institutions.\nOpposition Voices Concern\nCongress leader Rao Narendra Singh reacted strongly to the incident, calling it more than a financial lapse.\nHe described it as a serious blow to public trust and questioned how such a substantial amount could allegedly be misused without major negligence or possible collusion at higher levels. He also raised concerns about whether the government’s financial monitoring systems were functioning effectively.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "Four members of a family from Gujarat have been booked after a video surfaced online allegedly showing two of them abusing and threatening employees at a resort in Arunachal Pradesh’s Dibang Valley.\nThe incident took place at Mishmi Hills Resort in Anini, where the family had checked in on 18 February.\nA case was reportedly filed at Anini police station in connection with the matter based on the complaint by the hotel’s management.\nAccording to the complaint, guests were informed at the time of check-in that outside food and alcohol were not permitted inside the property, as per resort rules. However, on February 20, the family allegedly brought liquor from outside. When staff reminded them of the policy, the situation reportedly escalated, said a report by NDTV.\nThe FIR names Aastha Devendra Kumar Patel, Dhruv Devendra Kumar Patel, Smita Devendra Kumar Patel and Devendra Kumar Patel. It alleges that Aastha and Dhruv Patel used obscene and sexually derogatory language towards female staff members. Dhruv Patel is also accused of attempting to physically assault an employee.\nThe complaint further claims that the accused damaged a display frame containing the resort’s rules and threatened to tarnish the property’s reputation and have it shut down by using what they described as influential connections.\nPolice have invoked several sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, including those related to assault or use of criminal force against a woman, obscene acts and criminal intimidation. Provisions under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act have also been applied.\nThe controversy gained attention after the resort shared video clips of the incident on Instagram along with a detailed statement. In the post, the management said it felt “compelled\" to make the matter public and stressed that Mishmi Hills Resort has always aimed to offer warm hospitality to visitors from across India and abroad.\nThe statement added that the staff had politely explained the no outside food and drinks policy, but the guests allegedly responded with abuse, racist remarks and intimidation.\nThe resort further claimed that the guests mentioned links with prominent corporate personalities and organisations, in an attempt to pressure the staff.\nManaging Director Chimi Linggi said she stepped in after being informed about the confrontation and that the district tourism officer was present during efforts to defuse the situation.\n“We tried to speak politely, but they continued to get enraged. Our young staff, many from interior areas, were shaken by the incident,\" she said, adding that while the resort welcomes all tourists, such behaviour could not be ignored.\nDibang Valley Superintendent of Police Ringu N confirmed that officers were sent to verify the matter after the video went viral, according to a report by the outlet.\nHe said the accused had checked out on the morning of 21 February and that further investigation is ongoing.\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "Cash, Training & A Fresh Start: Inside India's Maoist Surrender Policy As Devuji Lays Down Arms",
        "content": "A Rs 5 lakh fixed deposit, a monthly stipend of Rs 10,000 for three years, vocational training, and incentives for surrendered weapons—these are among the key features of India’s Surrender-cum-Rehabilitation Scheme for Left Wing Extremists (LWEs), a policy aimed at drawing Maoist cadres away from armed insurgency and back into the mainstream.\nThe framework, valid until March 31, 2026, forms part of the Centre’s broader conflict-resolution strategy in LWE-affected states. It combines firm policing with financial and social rehabilitation, designed to ensure surrendered cadres do not return to the fold.\nThe policy came into sharp focus after top Maoist commander Devuji surrendered before police in Chhattisgarh in a move hailed by the state government as a major breakthrough against the insurgency.\nWhat the Policy Offers\nUnder the guidelines, financial assistance depends on rank:\n• Higher-ranking cadres, including state committee and central committee members, are eligible for a Rs 5 lakh grant.\n• Middle- and lower-ranking cadres may receive Rs 2.5 lakh.\n• The money is deposited as a fixed deposit in the surrenderee’s name and can be withdrawn after three years, subject to good behaviour certification by authorities. It can also serve as collateral for loans to start self-employment ventures.\n• In addition, surrendered weapons fetch separate incentives. Heavy weapons like LMGs or sniper rifles can earn Rs 35,000 per weapon, AK-series rifles Rs 25,000, and pistols or carbines Rs 10,000. Explosives, grenades, detonators, communication devices, and even ammunition rounds carry prescribed compensation rates. These incentives are also locked in fixed deposits for three years.\nTraining and Reintegration\nSurrendered cadres are initially housed in rehabilitation camps, where they receive training in trades aligned with their aptitude. During this period, they are entitled to a monthly stipend of Rs 10,000 for up to 36 months. If the individual secures government employment, the stipend is discontinued.\nThe aim, according to the policy framework, is not merely surrender but sustainable reintegration, preventing former cadres from being drawn back into the insurgency due to financial insecurity.\nStrict Screening Mechanism\nEligibility is not automatic. A Screening-cum-Rehabilitation Committee constituted by the state government scrutinises each case. The committee includes senior police officials, representatives from the Home Department, and Central Armed Police Forces.\nSurrendered cadres must confess to their involvement in extremist activities and provide operational details, including information about planners, financiers, and arms. Tactical surrenders—attempts to misuse the scheme for strategic gain—are explicitly barred.\nLegal Cases May Continue\nThe surrender does not guarantee immunity. Trials in heinous cases may proceed, though states can consider withdrawing minor cases on merit. Fast-track courts may be set up for speedy disposal.\nCentre-State Funding Model\nUnder the Security Related Expenditure (SRE) scheme, the Union government reimburses 60 per cent of the rehabilitation expenditure incurred by states, including grants and stipends, while states bear 40 per cent.\nDevuji’s Surrender In Context\nIt is within this framework that Devuji’s surrender assumes significance. As a senior Maoist commander operating in Chhattisgarh, his decision to lay down arms underscores the pressure faced by the insurgency amid sustained security operations and parallel rehabilitation outreach.\nOfficials suggest that high-profile surrenders such as Devuji’s not only weaken operational networks but also send a message to cadres deeper in the ranks that an exit route exists—backed by structured financial and institutional support.\nWith the policy remaining in force until 2026 and periodic reviews by the Ministry of Home Affairs, authorities hope more cadres will choose reintegration over insurgency, further shrinking the footprint of Left Wing Extremism in affected states.\nLatest Blogs",

Now the company has shared the launch date, and what products we could see on our shores in the next few weeks.\nXiaomi Pad 8 And Xiaomi 17 Series India Launch\nXiaomi Pad 8 and the Xiaomi 17 series are launching globally on February 28, 2026 at 18:30 PM IST and this lineup includes the premium Leica-toting Xiaomi 17 Ultra model. All these devices will be shaping the real action for the brand and we will be seeing them unveiled at the event later this week.\nXiaomi Pad 8 And Xiaomi 17 Series Launch: What To Expect\nXiaomi Pad 8 looks a different version from Pad 7 and by that we mean, the build quality, the hardware powering it as well as the accessory that work with it. The product teaser shows a track pad on the keyboard for the tablet which is a big change from the Pad 7 model unit. The Pad 8 is also getting a new stylus from the company, a thinner design also seems confirmed and even then you can expect a large battery pack.\nXiaomi 17 launched in China sports a 6.3-inch OLED display with 120Hz refresh rate.

        "content": "Union Home and Cooperation Minister Amit Shah interacted with drivers of Bharat Taxi and assured them of support for the new initiative. He told the drivers that the company belongs to them and asked them to be patient for the next three years as the platform is on its growing stage.\nOn February 5 in Delhi, Amit Shah launched India’s first cooperative-based ride-hailing platform, “Bharat Taxi\". The platform is India’s first government-backed cooperative ride-hailing app, seen as an alternative to Ola and Uber.\n\n\n\nAmit Shah said, “Our objective is to make the owner prosperous. The only difference is – you are the owner. You only need to invest Rs 500. If Bharat Taxi earns Rs 25 crore, 20 per cent will go into the company’s account as your share, and the remaining 80 per cent will be distributed based on taxi operations. This means that apart from fare income, you will also earn profit. You will need patience for the first three years. The accounts will remain transparent and accessible to you. It will function on cooperative principles. Bharat Taxi will not exploit you.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddressing the drivers, Amit Shah said the aim was not to earn big profits like other companies but to strengthen the ‘sarthi’ taxi drivers. He said the drivers would be the owners of the company and added that in the coming three years the service would expand to most states. Bharat Taxi is expected to grow across more states.\nAmit Shah said, “The concept is that the one who is working hard, the one who is toiling, should get the profit, not some rich man. Why did we come up with the idea of ​​Bharat Taxi? You said that there were a lot of complaints, 30 per cent was deducted, and there was no certainty… The purpose of running those companies is to make the owners rich. Our purpose is also to make the owners rich. The only difference is that you are the owner.\"\nThe platform follows a driver-owned model backed by Amul, IFFCO and NABARD.

        "title": "Agencies Flag Shift In Tactics As IS, Al-Qaeda Push Drone Warfare Playbook Online | Exclusive",
        "content": "Global jihadist groups like Islamic State (IS) and al-Qaeda are increasingly pushing digital content to give training to their cadres and sympathisers in drone operations.\nIn the past six months, India’s central investigation and intelligence agencies have intercepted huge digital material pointing to what officials describe as a clear shift in terror strategy from conventional attack methods to technology-driven tactics.\nGovernment sources said the matter has already been raised at the top level. Sources also said the material indicates efforts to equip operatives with the skills to operate and potentially weaponise commercially available unmanned aerial systems, underscoring the evolving nature of the threat landscape.\nSecurity officials term the development deeply worrisome, particularly for densely populated urban cities.\n“Unlike traditional attacks that require physical presence and direct execution, drone-enabled operations can be carried out remotely and triggered from a safer distance, reducing the risk for terrorists while making detection and attribution significantly more challenging for agencies,\" an official aware about the development told News18.\nThe minimal on-ground footprint and the ability to operate across distances complicate surveillance, interception, and response mechanisms.\nThe concerns have sharpened in the backdrop of the Red Fort area car bomb blast in Delhi. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has already announced the arrest of another key associate in the case. The agency stated that its investigations revealed the role of Jasir, who had allegedly provided technical support for carrying out terror attacks by modifying drones and attempting to make rockets ahead of the deadly car bomb blast that killed 10 people and injured 32 others.\nAs per the NIA press release, the accused, a resident of Qazigund in Anantnag district of Jammu & Kashmir, was an active co-conspirator who worked closely with the main accused, Umar un Nabi, in planning the attack. The agency said it continues to explore various angles to unravel the broader conspiracy behind the bombing, with multiple teams conducting searches across states to identify others involved.\nOfficials say the case highlights the growing intersection between terror networks and emerging technologies and has reinforced concerns that urban security frameworks must adapt rapidly to counter threats that can now be executed remotely, with limited physical trace and greater tactical sophistication.\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "'Prahaar': Ministry Of Home Affairs Unveils India's New National Counter-Terrorism Policy",
        "content": "The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has unveiled India’s new national counter-terrorism policy and strategy, titled ‘Prahaar’, outlining a comprehensive framework to address evolving terror threats through prevention, coordinated response, capacity building and adherence to the rule of law.\nIn its official release, the MHA stated that India has remained at the forefront of the global fight against terrorism for decades, even as the nature of threats continues to evolve.\n“While the nature of threats continues to change and present new challenges, India has remained consistently opposed to terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,\" the ministry said.\nThe release noted that instability in India’s immediate neighbourhood has often created ungoverned spaces and added that “few countries in the region have sometimes used terrorism as an instrument of State Policy.\"\nAt the same time, the government stressed that India does not associate terrorism with any religion or identity, stating, “India does not link terrorism to any specific religion, ethnicity, nationality or civilisation.\"\nReaffirming its stance, the ministry said India has always denounced terrorism “unambiguously and unequivocally\" and that its policy is guided by a principled approach of ‘zero tolerance’ against terrorism.\nFOUNDATION AND OBJECTIVES OF ‘PRAHAAR’\nAccording to the MHA, the counter-terrorism strategy flows from India’s long-standing commitment to stand by victims of terrorism and its belief that “there can be no justification whatsoever for violence in the world.\"\nThe strategy is predicated on key objectives, including prevention of terror attacks, swift and proportionate responses, aggregation of internal capacities through a whole-of-government approach, and ensuring human rights and rule-of-law-based processes.\nIt also focuses on attenuating conditions that enable terrorism, aligning international counter-terror efforts, and strengthening recovery and resilience through a whole-of-society approach.\nEVOLVING THREATS AND SECURITY CONCERNS\nThe ministry said India has long faced sponsored terrorism from across the border, with jihadi terror outfits and their frontal organisations continuing to plan and facilitate attacks.\nIt added that global terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda and ISIS have attempted to incite violence through sleeper cells.\nThe release highlighted the growing misuse of technology by terror groups, stating that handlers frequently use “the latest technologies, including the use of drones, for facilitating terror-related activities and attacks in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir.\"\nIt further noted that terrorists increasingly rely on social media platforms and instant messaging applications for propaganda, recruitment and communication, while technologies such as encryption, the dark web and crypto wallets enable anonymous operations.\nConcerns were also raised about attempts by terrorist organisations to access Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, Explosive and Digital (CBRNED) materials, alongside cyber-attacks carried out by criminal hackers and nation states.\nPREVENTION AND INTELLIGENCE-LED APPROACH\nThe MHA said India follows a proactive and intelligence-guided approach to counter terrorism.\nThe Multi Agency Centre (MAC) and Joint Task Force on Intelligence (JTFI) within the Intelligence Bureau serve as nodal platforms for real-time intelligence sharing and coordinated action.\nLaw enforcement agencies continue efforts to counter misuse of the internet by disrupting online propaganda, recruitment networks and logistical support systems, including overground worker (OGW) modules.\nSpecial emphasis has also been placed on disrupting terror funding networks through legal mechanisms.\nThe ministry added that border guarding forces and immigration authorities have been equipped with advanced technologies to secure threats across land, air and water, while critical sectors such as power, aviation, ports, defence and atomic energy are being protected from state and non-state actors.\nRESPONSE AND CAPACITY BUILDING\nThe release stated that local police remain the first responders during terror incidents, supported by specialised state and central forces.\nThe National Security Guard (NSG) functions as the nodal national counter-terror force, assisting states and conducting capacity-building initiatives.\nInvestigations by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and state police agencies, coupled with high prosecution rates, are aimed at creating deterrence against future terror incidents.\nModernisation of training, acquisition of advanced technology and standardisation of procedures across agencies form a key component of capacity enhancement under the strategy.\nHUMAN RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW\nEmphasising legal safeguards, the ministry said Indian anti-terror laws give due importance to human rights and operate within the framework of the rule of law.\nIt noted that India adheres to principles where laws are applied evenly and protect fundamental rights, while multiple levels of judicial redressal remain available to accused persons.\nDE-RADICALISATION AND WHOLE-OF-SOCIETY APPROACH\nThe policy places strong emphasis on countering radicalisation.\nThe MHA said intelligence and law enforcement agencies adopt graded responses to address violent extremism, while community leaders, NGOs and moderate preachers are engaged to spread awareness about the consequences of extremist violence.\nEfforts are also being undertaken to prevent radicalisation in prisons and to address socio-economic vulnerabilities through education, employment and welfare initiatives aimed at youth and women.\nINTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AND WAY FORWARD\nHighlighting the transnational nature of terrorism, the ministry said international partnerships remain critical through intelligence sharing, extradition arrangements and cooperation frameworks.\nIndia will continue working with global partners to designate terrorists and build consensus on counter-terror measures.\nLooking ahead, the MHA said further cooperation among agencies, periodic legal reforms and enhanced capacity building of state counter-terror units remain necessary.\nThe strategy aims to deny terrorists access to funds, weapons and safe havens while investing in technology and partnerships to counter future threats.\nThe ministry stated that through ‘Prahaar’, India seeks to strengthen coordinated national action and pursue a comprehensive

        "content": "Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday clarified that there is no proposal for a mandatory 20-year cooling-off period for retired army officers writing books. Speaking to reporters, the minister said that no such proposal came up for discussion before the Cabinet. Therefore, there will be no restriction or ban on former Army officials or retiring officials on writing books soon after their retirement.\nThis controversy sparked over a book — “Four Stars of Destiny\" — written by former Army chief General MM Naravane. This book caused a nationwide stir after the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, tried to read excerpts from it in the parliament.\nThe book is on the Ladakh standoff with China.\nThe stunt witnessed massive uproar and it was alleged that the book contained sensitive information regarding national security.

        "title": "India Shows How AI Can Work At Scale, But Inclusion Remains The Challenge: World Bank | Exclusive",
        "content": "The ‘India AI Impact Summit 2026’ brought together policymakers, industry leaders, multilateral institutions, and technologists at an unprecedented scale, signalling a shift in the global conversation around artificial intelligence.\nMoving beyond hype and model size, the summit focused squarely on how artificial intelligence (AI) can deliver real-world development outcomes, from jobs and productivity to public service delivery, while confronting risks around inequality, exclusion, and trust.\nFor the World Bank Group, the summit was a key moment to advance its vision of AI as a tool for inclusive growth. As governments across the Global South race to embed AI into welfare systems, education, healthcare, and governance, the World Bank has positioned itself at the centre of debates on responsible adoption, digital public infrastructure, cybersecurity, and global safeguards. Its emphasis on “small AI\", practical, affordable systems that work in low-resource settings, reflects a broader push to ensure AI narrows, rather than widens, development gaps.\nCNN-News18 spoke with Paul Procee, acting country director for India at the World Bank, and Mahesh Uttamchandani, regional practice director for digital and AI across East Asia and the Pacific and South Asia. The conversations ranged from the risks of AI-led exclusion and algorithmic bias to India’s role in shaping global AI norms, the governance challenges of deploying AI at the state level, and the uncomfortable truths policymakers still avoid when it comes to AI and inequality.\nExcerpts from the interview:\nThe World Bank increasingly frames AI as a development tool, but many argue it risks widening inequality in low-capacity states. How do you ensure AI projects backed by the World Bank do not end up benefiting governments and vendors more than vulnerable populations?\nMahesh Uttamchandani: At the World Bank Group, our focus is clear – AI must drive inclusion, not deepen divides. That means designing AI that works for people at the margins, not just for governments or tech vendors. We are prioritising what we call “small AI\" solutions that are affordable, practical, and effective even where connectivity and infrastructure are limited.\nIn Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, we are working with governments and partners to assess AI-powered learning tools that help students build job-ready skills. In Uttar Pradesh, AI tools are helping farmers reach wider markets, raise incomes, and create new employment opportunities. These initiatives show that when AI is grounded in local realities, it can deliver immediate gains in health, education, and agriculture, and directly strengthen communities rather than bypass them.\nIndia’s digital public infrastructure is often held up as a global model. As AI gets embedded into welfare delivery, health, and education systems, what specific risks of exclusion or error worry the World Bank most in the Indian context?\nPaul Procee: India has emerged as a global benchmark for digital public infrastructure. Platforms like Aadhaar and unified payments interface (UPI) show how technology can deliver services at scale with speed and transparency. But as AI is embedded into welfare delivery, health, and education, new risks come into focus.\nThe biggest concern is exclusion by design. Algorithmic bias, weak local-language data, or systems trained on non-representative datasets can unintentionally lock out certain communities. There are also serious cybersecurity risks. Attacks on AI-enabled systems could disrupt essential services or expose sensitive personal data, undermining public trust.\nFor the World Bank Group, the priority is to put responsible AI governance and cybersecurity at the core, not as an afterthought. That means strong data governance, transparency around how algorithms are deployed, effective grievance redress mechanisms, and clear lines of accountability.\nIndia has already taken important steps in this direction. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act establishes clear rules on consent, data handling responsibilities, and cross-border data sharing. Building on this emphasis on trust, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, at the AI Impact Summit, called for a “glass box\" approach to AI. The idea is simple but powerful – AI systems should be open, explainable, and governed by visible and verifiable safety rules, not hidden behind opaque black boxes.\nSeveral Indian states are now experimenting with AI in policing, education, and social services. Is the World Bank engaging directly with state governments on AI deployment and, if so, how does it ensure consistency with national and global safeguards?\nPaul Procee: AI governance cannot stop at state or national borders. Data flows freely across jurisdictions, and risks such as cyber threats or misinformation do not respect boundaries. That is why regulation must be rooted in local realities, but anchored in shared global principles.\nThe World Bank Group follows a layered approach. At the state level, AI deployment must comply with national laws. At the same time, it should reflect global best practices on fairness, transparency, accountability, and data privacy.\nStates need room to tailor AI tools to local needs, but within a common safeguards framework. The approach we advocate is risk-based, principles-driven, and aligned with each country’s institutional capacity and level of digital maturity.\nThis philosophy extends globally. For instance, we have supported the development of the African Union AI Continental Strategy, which strikes a balance between regional coordination and national flexibility.\nAI may be borderless, but governance cannot be one-dimensional. It has to operate simultaneously at the local, national, and global levels to ensure innovation moves forward safely, inclusively, and with shared standards of trust.\nIndia increasingly positions itself as a voice for the Global South on technology governance. Does the World Bank see India as a co-architect of global AI norms, or mainly as a test case whose lessons are later exported elsewhere?\nPaul Procee: India is both a co-architect of global AI norms and a proving ground for inclusive AI at scale. Its strength lies in its ability to pilot innovation through regulatory sandboxes and targeted programmes, and then rapidly scale what works. That transition from proof of concept to nationwide impact offers powerful lessons for other developing economies.\nMore importantly, India is helping reframe the global AI conversation. Instead of focusing only on ever larger models or greater computing power, it is pushing the debate toward development outcomes such as jobs created, productivity gains, and better public service delivery. The World Bank Group is partnering with India in this shift by supporting “small AI\": task-specific, multilingual systems that function on low bandwidth and basic smartphones.\nIndia’s leadership also matters at the regional and Global South level. Not every country can build large-scale computing infrastructure on its own, but shared facilities, common standards, and open-source partnerships can expand collective capacity. With its scale, technical talent, and policy ambition, India is shaping how AI governance and digital development evolve across the Global South.\nFinally, after listening to leaders and industry voices at the AI Impact Summit, what is the most promising signal you’ve seen for AI-led development – and what is the most uncomfortable truth about AI and inequality that policymakers still prefer to avoid?\nMahesh Uttamchandani: The most promising signal is the growing recognition that AI can create jobs and expand opportunity when it is designed for inclusion. “Small AI\", practical and affordable tools, is already showing results. We see students receiving personalised learning support, farmers accessing better advisory services, small entrepreneurs building digital credit histories, and clinics extending care to underserved communities. These applications boost productivity and open new pathways to employment for people who are often left behind.\nTo turn this potential into real jobs and opportunity, countries need to learn from one another. That is why the World Bank Group, together with six other multilateral development banks, has launched the AI Repository. It brings together real-world AI applications in development, allowing governments to adapt, replicate, and scale what is proven to work.\nThe uncomfortable truth is that inclusion also increases exposure. As the poorest and most vulnerable are brought into digital systems, risks are unavoidable, from fraud and misinformation to algorithmic bias. Policymakers still tend to treat safeguards as secondary. That is a mistake. Responsible regulation, strong consumer protection, transparency, accountability, and human oversight must be built in from the start. AI can be a powerful force for development, but managing its risks is not optional. It is a shared responsibility.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "The Karnataka government is considering a significant move that could change how young students interact with technology. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has initiated discussions on restricting mobile phone use for children below the age of 16, citing growing concerns over social media addiction and its impact on young minds.\nThe issue was raised during a meeting with vice chancellors of government universities. Seeking their views, the Chief Minister questioned whether such a restriction would be practical and beneficial.\n“Today we are discussing this, and as you are all Vice Chancellors here, I seek your opinion. Children are falling prey to drugs. Also, in line with Australia and some European countries, there is a thought to ban mobile phones among students. I want your opinion on this. We are looking at this for children below 16, not adults. Many of them are falling prey to social media addiction,\" Siddaramaiah said.\nThis comes amid increasing concern about excessive screen time among teenagers. Studies have linked prolonged phone usage to poor concentration, behavioural changes, and mental health challenges.\nAuthorities are now looking for possible ways to implement it across schools and colleges.\nIf approved, Karnataka would join countries like Australia that have introduced measures to curb digital addiction among school students. The proposed restriction would apply only to minors under 16.\nMeanwhile, neighbouring Andhra Pradesh is also reviewing social media regulations. A Group of Ministers led by Nara Lokesh has been formed to examine existing laws and consider stricter controls on children’s online access.\nA final decision in Karnataka is expected after consultations with education experts and stakeholders.\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "‘Imperils India's Image’: Delhi Court Rebukes Youth Congress Over AI Summit Protest",
        "content": "A Delhi Court came down heavily on four members of the Indian Youth Congress (IYC) over their “shirtless protest\" inside Bharat Mandapam during the AI Impact Summit 2026, saying that their conduct was not legitimate dissent, rather a “blatant assault on public order\" that imperilled India’s diplomatic image.\nJudicial Magistrate Ravi made the observation when the four IYC workers were produced before his court. The court sent the four accused to five days of police custody.\nWhile allowing the Delhi Police’s plea for custodial interrogation, the magistrate said that the alleged actions of the accused “imperil not merely the event’s sanctity but also the Republic’s diplomatic image before foreign stakeholders, rendering it wholly unprotected by constitutional safeguards.\"\nAccording to the court order, as accessed exclusively by CNN-News18, the IYC members orchestrated a premeditated intrusion into the high-security precincts of Bharat Mandapam during the AI Summit 2026.\n“…the accused persons are alleged to have orchestrated a premeditated intrusion into the high-security precincts of Bharat Mandapam during the Al Summit 2026, a premier international conclave hosting global delegates and dignitaries,\" the court’s order said.\nWhile seeking custody of the arrested activists, the Police told the court that the accused donned provocative T-shirts bearing slogans such as “India US Trade Deal Compromised\", raised slogans, obstructed public servants, and allegedly assaulted police personnel, causing injuries substantiated by medico-legal reports.\nThey further said that protests were inspired by Nepal’s violent Gen Z movement that toppled the government there.\n“This is a larger conspiracy that has taken inspiration from the Gen Z protests in Nepal. The accused need to be confronted with each other as well as with digital evidence. This is a very important investigation,\" police said.\nThe court said custodial interrogation was essential to unearth a larger conspiracy, funding sources, digital evidence and possible absconding associates. It noted that the accused hailed from remote regions, raising concerns about flight risk.\nThe magistrate said the alleged offences warrant “stringent scrutiny\" as they posed a grave threat to public order and state security at an international forum.\n\n\nIndia hosted the world’s largest artificial intelligence conclave, the AI Impact Summit-2026. The summit that began on February 16 has seen packed halls and long queues, as tech moguls, industry leaders, policymakers, founders, and technologists thronged the Bharat Mandapam.\nAround 10 activists of the Congress’s youth wing had entered the AI Summit venue in New Delhi and staged a shirtless protest, raising slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the India-US trade deal. The protesters wore or carried white T-shirts printed with images of PM Modi and US President Donald Trump along with slogans targeting the government.\nSecurity personnel quickly intervened and the protesters were later arrested for disrupting the high-profile summit, which was attended by global technology leaders including Sam Altman and Sundar Pichai.\nThe protest sparked a political row, with BJP leaders condemning it as “anti-national\" and accusing the Congress of harming India’s global image, while the Congress defended the demonstration as legitimate democratic dissent reflecting youth anger.\nLatest Blogs",
