The Opposition has been quick to seize the opportunity and extend support to the protesting candidates.\nWhile the State government’s current predicament comes around the confusion and judicial intervention in the internal reservation issue that has stalled recruitment for nearly a year now, two key commissions — reports of which were submitted to the government in recent months — have cautioned the government against “automatic” replacement of retiring staff.\n“Sanctioned faculty posts reflect older disciplinary boundaries, curriculum modes, and staffing patterns. A blind recruitment exercise has risk of locking public resources into outdated programme architecture that may no longer serve societal or economic priorities”\nThe Karnataka Policy and Planning Commission, headed by B.R. Patil, which submitted its report recently, is learnt to have cautioned the government against filling up existing vacancies on “as-is” basis, especially in the faculty recruitment for Karnataka’s higher education system. Of the 24,788 posts in higher education, 13,599 are currently vacant and the government has sanctioned filling up of 2,000 posts.\nThe education sub-committee in the commission is learnt to have pointed out that hiring without re-thinking the higher education’s future runs the risk of misalignment with rapidly evolving economy, which is being driven by Artificial Intelligence, automation, and emerging industries. The sub-committee, sources said, was not against recruitment and also acknowledged significant shortage of teaching staff across government degree colleges and State universities.\n“Technological shifts such as AI, digitisation, and new labour models, have reduced market’s reliance on generic degrees. Many traditional degree programmes across social sciences, humanities, and general sciences were historically valued for symbolic degree capital rather than job-linked competence,” the source explained.\nFurther, the source said: “Sanctioned faculty posts reflect older disciplinary boundaries, curriculum modes, and staffing patterns. A blind recruitment exercise has risk of locking public resources into outdated programme architecture that may no longer serve societal or economic priorities.”\nMeanwhile, though the second Karnataka Administrative Reforms Commission headed by R.V. Deshpande identified 2.94 lakh vacant posts as against the sanctioned strength of 8.16 lakh in the State, it also cautioned against automatic replacement of retiring staff and has called for periodic review of sanctioned posts, besides abolition of redundant and obsolete posts.\nInterestingly, in the Backward Classes Welfare Department, the ARC identified 240 BE graduates, 180 MTech graduates, and about 2,000 MCA/BBA/BCA graduates working as kitchen and allied staff, revealing the desperation for government job. A significant number of BE/ MTech/MCA graduates are working as first division and second division clerks or junior assistants.\nThough it has recommended recruitment in a time-bound manner, the ARC also asked the government to review posts to justify afresh with current relevance and necessity.\nPublic recruitments in Karnataka has been hit over the last year-and-a-half over the issue of Scheduled Castes sub-classification following the August 2024 order of the Supreme Court. While the recruitment had been stopped for about a year, the government has relaxed the age eligibility criteria to provide a chance for candidates who have crossed the age limit. However, with the sub-classification case being heard in the Karnataka High Court, recruitments have been hit. However, on Thursday, the State government decided to stick to 50% quota and restart recruitment process.\nThe demand to fill up 2.94 lakh vacant posts is coming around a time when the share of committed expenditure that includes salaries and pension has gone up, especially after the implementation of the pay commission recommendations. While the estimated expenditure on salaries is ₹85,860 crore for 2025-2026, pension was ₹37,655 crore, which is about 40% of the revenue expenditure that was pegged at ₹3.11 lakh crore. The funding for five guarantee schemes — estimated to be around ₹55,000 crore — has only widened revenue deficit. The Finance Department — over the years and across all governments — has also been tough on the question of hiring of personnel that is contributing to the ballooning revenue expenditure.\n(This is the second of a three-part series)\nPublished - February 27, 2026 07:00 am IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Karunakaran\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has told authorities to fix accountability with regard to the row over the National Council of Educational Research and Training’s (NCERT) Class 8 Social Science textbook chapter on “corruption” in judiciary. According to government sources, the Prime Minister has directed that the matter be looked into in detail and accountability be fixed.\nMeanwhile, Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Thursday (February 26, 2026) said that the government will conduct an inquiry into the matter, and added that responsibility for this will be fixed and action will be taken against officials responsible for it.\nAlso, the Education Ministry has written to the Information and Broadcasting (I&B) Ministry and the Electronics and Information Technology Ministry (MeitY) to stop dissemination of the controversial textbook via digital platforms and media.\nThe section in question in the new Social Science textbook created outrage this week, even as a Bench led by Chief Justice of India Surya Kant registered a suo motu case over it calling it a “selective reference”, with the NCERT withdrawing the textbook from distribution within a day of releasing it.\nHours after the Supreme Court of India took up the case, the NCERT issued a statement apologising and regretting the “inappropriate textual material” and “error in judgement” that had “crept into” the chapter.\nAlso Read | NCERT under scrutiny: Legal literacy or political agenda?\nOn Thursday (February 25, 2026), even as the Supreme Court heard the case over this section in the NCERT book, Mr. Pradhan spoke to presspersons in Jharkhand, saying that he was “deeply saddened” by the incident, adding that he expressed regret over it.\n“The moment it came to our notice, directions were issued to withdraw the book and stop its distribution. We have the utmost respect for the judiciary and there was no intent to disrespect the judiciary,” Mr. Pradhan said.\nThe Education Minister further said that inquiries will be made to fix responsibility for the inclusion of this section in the book, also stating that action will be taken against those responsible for it.\nThe chapter ‘The Role of the Judiciary in Our Society’ in a Class 8 Social Science book prescribed by NCERT mentions that corruption, a massive backlog of cases, and a lack of adequate number of judges were among the “challenges” faced by the judicial system. The section on “corruption in the judiciary” in the book states that judges were bound by a code of conduct that governed not only their behaviour in court but also how they conducted themselves outside of it.\nIn his remarks in Jharkhand, the Education Minister said that the government has taken note of the Supreme Court’s directions and will fully comply with the directions.\nOn Thursday (February 26, 2026) morning, while hearing the suo motu case on the issue, the Supreme Court ordered a complete, blanket ban on the reprinting and digital dissemination of the book, and directed the seizure of the books that had been distributed so far, also calling for a compliance report on the same.\nPublished - February 27, 2026 06:58 am IST\njudiciary (system of justice)\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        crime, law and justice\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        politics\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Breaking News, Myanmar Aid, Bengaluru Train, Kamakhya Derailment, Modi RSS Visit, India Headlines, Southeast Asia Crisis, Humanitarian Efforts, Railway Accident, Political Updates, Myanmar Cyclone,\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

The report also mentioned that there was “mismatch” of tax liability of TDS/TCS of ₹64.91 crore in 12 cases of eight taxpayers in seven circles.\n“Total receipts of the Government of Bihar for the year 2022-2023 amounted to ₹1,72,688.02 crore of which revenue raised by the state government from its own resources was ₹48,152.63 crore. The share of receipts from the government of India amounted to ₹1,24,535.39 crore (72.12% of the total receipts)”, said the C&AG report laid in the House on Thursday (February 26) which also added further that, “arrears of revenues as on March 31’ 2023 in respect of the principle heads of revenue amounted to ₹4,884.86 crore of which ₹1,430.32 crore was outstanding for more than five years”.\nThe C&AG report has categorized the arrears across various departments. The audit report noted that the Mines and Geology Department has failed to provide details on these dues for more than five years.\nAlso read: CAG report tabled in Puducherry Assembly\nThe report also underlined that there was “mismatch of tax liability of TDS/TCS (Tax Deducted at Source and Tax Collected at Source) of ₹64.91 crore in 12 cases of eight taxpayers in seven circles”. Besides, said the report, “non-compliance to the departmental instructions for realization of road, education, health and agriculture cesses by the concerned DLAOs (District Land Acquisition Offices) resulted in in a shortfall of ₹1.15 crore in cess collection”.\nSimilarly, the Bihar Rajya Pul Nirman Nigam Limited, the C&AG report said, “incurred an infructuous expenditure of ₹5.35 crore on construction of an incomplete bridge due to overlooking the mandatory compliance requirements of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958 during project planning.\n“Underassessment/short levy/loss of revenue aggregating to ₹4,719.19 crore was in 1,764 cases. The departments concerned accepted underassessment and other deficiencies of ₹23.09 crore in 263 cases, pointed out during previous years and reported recovery of ₹1.57 crore in 82 cases”, the report said adding, “twenty registering authorities could not detect undervaluation of land in 42 instruments which resulted in undervaluation of property/instrument and consequently short levy of Stamp Duty and Registration Fee for ₹4.45 crore”.\n“Out of 37 working State Public Sector Enterprises (SPSEs) 13 incurred losses, as per their latest finalized accounts during 2022-2023. As on 2023 March, there were 14 SPSEs which accumulated losses of ₹27,307.96 crore. The net worth of 10 out of these 14 SPSEs was completely eroded by accumulated losses and their net worth was negative as per the latest finalized accounts as on 31 March 2023,” said the report which also mentioned that “due to its lackadaisical approach, Bihar State Educational Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited could not properly monitor renewal and verify the genuineness of Bank Guarantees submitted resulting into undue favor to contactors amounting to ₹94.25 lakh”.\nFurther, the report added, “implementation of Mukhyamantri Kshetra Vikas Yojana (MKVY) in all the 13 test-checked divisions of Local Area Engineering Organization (LAEO), 28 to 59% of the total available funds were not utilized resulting in unspent balances lying in their respective Personal Ledger accounts”. “The Bihar Local Area Development Agency (BLAFDA) did not prepare any model designs and estimates although required for execution of works under MKVY”, it said.\nSimilarly, the report further said that “there was significantly less expenditure on Information, Education and Communication (IEC) activities which affected awareness activities amongst beneficiaries and led to low level of verification of targeted beneficiaries”.\nPublished - February 27, 2026 06:41 am IST\nBihar\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

C\nA fusion of talent, ideas, and all-pervasive energy was clearly visible at the Vellore Institute of Technology’s (VIT) cultural fest, ‘Riviera 2026’, which commenced at the college campus in Vellore on Thursday.\nThe four-day festival was inaugurated by former Indian Women Cricket captain Mithali Raj in the presence of G.

She also acknowledged that the playing conditions in England was more challenging than its cricket team.\nIn his presidential address, Mr. Viswanathan said Ms. Raj was bilingual as she is fluent in Tamil and Telugu. “She (Ms. Raj) has made history with her performances at national and international levels. Such cultural festivals help students from other countries share ideas and exhibit their talents,” he said.\nAs part of the pro-shows of Riviera 2026, playback singer Sunidhi Chauhan’s performance was part of the inaugural on Thursday.

File picture\n                                          | Photo Credit: Reuters\nCongress MLAs in the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly on Thursday (February 26, 2026) alleged irregularities in the land acquisition and compensation for a coal block allotted to the Adani Group in Singrauli district, and demanded a joint House committee to investigate the matter.\nThe demand, raised by Leader of Opposition Umang Singhar, led to intense discussions and arguments between the Treasury and Opposition benches, which further led to the Congress MLAs staging a walkout from the House. The Government, however, denied the charges and said that the land acquisition was being done as per the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (RFCTLARR) Act, 2013, while assuring that a probe will be conducted in case there are any irregularities.\nAlso Read | Environment Ministry’s claims on Adani Group’s coal mine in Madhya Pradesh are ‘false’, says Congress\nIn September last year, the Adani Group said that it has received approval from the Union Ministry of Coal to start the mining operations at Dhirauli mine, managed by the Mahan Energen Ltd, a subsidiary of Adani Power. The Dhirauli coal block, that covers multiple villages and forest area in Singrauli district, is among the largest in Madhya Pradesh, spread across nearly 27 square kilometres, and felling of about 5.70 lakh trees is currently going on in the area.\nDuring the Question Hour, Mr. Singhar said that 12,998 families were being affected in the eight villages, many of them tribal dominated, where land acquisition was being done and alleged massive irregularities in the payout plans.\nAlso Read | Congress alleges FRA violations in Adani coal mine project in Madhya Pradesh\nHe alleged that several outsiders, including the family members of police officers posted in the area, have received land acquisition compensation of upto Rs15 lakh illegally, claiming that he had gathered the data from the District Collector’s office.\n“Outsiders came and built houses there and received compensation. The local tribals, the local people, did not receive compensation. You said that there are many people whose money still hasn’t been deposited into their accounts. I want to tell you their names, but the poor people are being thrown out. They are being told to demolish their houses with their own hands. Then they will be given the compensation. This is the government’s policy,” Mr. Singhar said, claiming that the locals were only receiving about Rs2.5 lakh for their lands.\nRevenue Minister Karan Singh Verma, however, a total of 2,672 hectare of land is to be acquired for the block which includes over 554 hectare of private land in eight villages and 1,335 hectare of protected forest land.\nHe said that land acquisition is almost complete in five of these villages and claimed that a tribal family will receive at least ₹50 lakh in compensation from the government.\n“We have taken care of all the displaced people and have allocated ₹368 crore as reward money for them. We will resettle the displaced. We have also allotted land for them. The company will provide 3 crore rupees, and as the LoP is asking, a tribal will receive at least ₹50 lakh,” Mr. Verma said, later adding that more than ₹144 have already been given as compensation.\nMr. Singhar, however, refuted the claims and said no tribal family is receiving more than ₹2-2.5 lakh.\n“An amount of approximately ₹368 crore, if divided among 12,000 families, comes to ₹2 lakh, then how did the tribals get ₹50 lakh [per family]?” he said, while also asking how the Adani Group was approved to operate the mine when the land acquisition was still going on. He demanded that the mining operations be halted till the land acquisition is complete and locals have been compensated and rehabilitated.\nAs the Congress MLAs demanded a probe committee, Rural Development and Panchayat Minister Prahlad Patel said that while forming a panel was upto the House Chair, the government will probe the allegations and present a list of those who have received compensation.\nAs Speaker Narendra Singh Tomar directed to move to the next issue, the scenes turned chaotic with the Congress MLAs demanding the panel. Various MLAs also entered the well resorting to sloganeering, leading to some brief adjournments.\nEven as the Congress MLAs alleged that the government was “escaping” from an investigation, Mr. Patel said that the government was ready for one.\nFollowing multiple adjournments and intense uproar, the Congress MLAs staged a walk out from the House.\nPublished - February 27, 2026 02:20 am IST\nMadhya Pradesh\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Once the project proves successful, it would place substantial long-term orders to enable scaling of the solution.\nThe policy is designed to also ensure that successful innovations are implemented at scale.\nInnovation areas include AI-powered elephant intrusion detection systems (EIDS) to reduce wildlife collision, AI-based fire detection systems in coaches, drone-based broken rail detection, rail stress monitoring systems, sensor-based load calculation devices for parcel vans (VPUs), solar panel integration on coaches, AI-enabled coach cleaning monitoring systems, obstruction detection in low-visibility and foggy conditions, AI-driven pension management and dispute resolution systems.\nIn a separate move, the Minister also announced the complete digitisation and AI-enabled transformation of the Railway Claims Tribunal (RCT), which will enable computerisation of filing of claims and their processing and adjudication making the entire process more transparent and accessible from anywhere in the country.\nPublished - February 27, 2026 01:40 am IST\nrailway\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Stalin virtually inaugurated a permanent building for the District Central Library in Ranipet town on Thursday, bringing an end to a long-standing demand of readers in the district.\nOfficials from the School Education Department, which has funded the ₹3.72 crore project, said that the central library was started in the 1950s. The library was functioning in the District Central Library complex in Vellore town for many years before it was moved to a two-storey cramped building of the municipality in Ranipet town in 2019, when the district was created after the bifurcation of the erstwhile unified Vellore district.\nMinister for Handlooms and Textiles and Ranipet MLA R. Gandhi inspected the new building complex in the town. “Permanent building for the central library will also have e-books and virtual library facilities. Around one lakh books will be accommodated in the new building as against the existing around 50,000 books,” R. Ganesan, librarian, Ranipet Central Library, told The Hindu.\nThe existing library is located on a 2,500 sq. ft. land near Ranipet Town police station. English and Tamil books on various subjects adorn its racks. Novels in both languages are also a key attraction. The subjects covered include history, politics, law, economics, philosophy, agriculture, computer and mathematics. “Books on competitive examinations are a big attraction in the library. The new building should also have basic amenities for visitors,” said B. Pavan, a reader.\nReference books, especially for examinations conducted by the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC), UPSC, and other competitive exams, are available here. The first floor of the library building comprises the newspaper and magazines sections that have good patronage, especially among students and aspirants.\nAt present, the district has 71 libraries, including 55 branch and village libraries with around 1.5 lakh members. Four full-time libraries also function in Walajah, Arcot, Ranipet and Arakkonam between 8 a.m and 8 p.m. Other libraries function from 9 a.m. - 12.30 p.m., 3 p.m. - 6.30 p.m. on all days, including Sundays. A rent-free building and a population of around 1,000 persons are eligible to set up a government library in the area.\nOfficials said that the new building has been built on 35 cents of land that belongs to the Ranipet municipality. The two-storey building has a lobby, store rooms, newspaper and magazine sections, ladies and children sections, research section and book repair section. Each floor has a washroom and drinking water facilities. The new facility will also receive a copy of all new publications, adding to its existing stock of books in the library.\nMeanwhile, the dilapidated Tirupattur District Central Library will also get a permanent building soon as work on the new facility is progressing at a faster pace. Currently, the library functions in the Government Girls Higher Secondary School in Tirupattur town.\nPublished - February 27, 2026 01:18 am IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Singh, a former scientist of the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Chairman and Managing Director of Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) Dr. Buddhaprakash Jyoti, a member of the NITI Aayog Committee, said the Committee formed to identify and develop critical mineral resources within the country would play a pivotal role in strengthening the country’s resource security.\nHe informed that the company was exploring the extraction of Rare Earth Elements (REEs) from the overburden and clays present in coal seams of its opencast mines. Additionally, efforts were being made to recover valuable minerals from fly ash and bottom ash generated at the Singareni Thermal Power Plant.\nOther members of the committee stated that critical minerals such as lithium, rare earth elements, cobalt and nickel were indispensable for sectors including renewable energy, electric vehicles, electronics, defence and advanced manufacturing. While India possessed notable reserves of certain critical minerals, limited exploration and mining activities had resulted in continued dependence on imports.\nWith the demand expected to increase substantially in the coming years, the Committee called for a coordinated national effort involving both public and private sector mining companies. The meeting featured detailed discussions on the current demand-supply scenario, exploration opportunities across various States, policy support mechanisms and the role of government agencies and mining organisations.\nDeputy Advisor (Minerals) of NITI Aayog R. Saravanabhavan, informed that time-bound action would be initiated to finalise and submit the Committee’s report. CMD of NLC India Ltd M. Prasanna Kumar participated virtually.\nPublished - February 27, 2026 12:40 am IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Among the parties that took part at the meeting were the DMK, the AIADMK, the Congress, the BJP, the CPI(M), the VCK, the DMDK, the NTK, the BSP, the AAP, and the NPP.\nMost parties appreciated the Election Commission for the peaceful and smooth conduct of the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of the electoral rolls in Tamil Nadu, the release said. “Political parties urged the Commission to take stringent measures to curb the use of money power and distribution of freebies during elections. Some political parties asked for an increase in the number of flying squads to curb malpractices during elections.” Some parties urged the Commission to keep in mind the upcoming festivals while finalising the election schedule.\nDMK organising secretary R.S. Bharathi and legal wing secretary N.R.  Elango said in a representation that the age cohort details in the final electoral rolls were not fully published and many District Election Officers were reluctant to share them. They added that the names and other details were not properly recorded and old voter ID card details continued to be referenced. In a separate representation, CPI(M) State secretary P. Shanmugam demanded that the Assembly election be conducted in a single phase. The CPI(M) also demanded the resequencing of the placement of machines in the order of ballot unit, followed by control unit, and VVPAT. The party urged the Commission to provide new EPIC cards with revised part and serial numbers to all electors and ensure drinking water and other facilities at polling booths on the day of polling.\nMr. Gyanesh Kumar assured the parties that their suggestions would be considered, the release said.\nThe Commission also held a detailed discussion with the heads/nodal officers of enforcement agencies, IGs, DIGs, DEOs, and SPs on election planning, EVM management, logistics, training of election staff, seizures, law and order, voter awareness, and outreach activities.\nThe Commission directed the heads/nodal officers of the enforcement agencies to act with impartiality and clamp down on all inducements. It also directed the DEOs and the SPs to prioritise voters’ comfort and accessibility at polling stations, impart robust training to officials, and ensure wide awareness of the electoral processes. The Commission also directed the officers to act without fear or favour and stressed that there would be zero tolerance towards any deviation from the rules and laws.\nThe Commission issued the notification for the biennial election from Tamil Nadu to six seats in the Rajya Sabha. The tenure of the six sitting members will expire on April 2. According to the notification, R. Santhi, Additional Secretary, Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly Secretariat, would be the Returning Officer, and P. Thenmozhi, Joint Secretary, Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly Secretariat, would be the Assistant Returning Officer.

Regularisation of Unapproved Layouts and Plots Rules, 2020 (LRS-2020), and the A.P. Regulation and Penalisation of Buildings Constructed Unauthorisedly and in Deviation to the Sanctioned Plan Rules, 2025 (BPS-2025).\nThe revised framework aims at ensuring sustainable and liveable cities and towns, while addressing critical gaps in storm water management, sewerage, sanitation, and environmental infrastructure, according to the press release.\nWhile substantial investments are being made under AMRUT 2.0 scheme for augmentation of water supply, sewerage and rejuvenation of water bodies, significant funding gaps persist in key urban infrastructure sectors.\nIn this context, funds realised under LRS and BPS, earmarked for developmental purposes, will now be prioritised for storm water drainage works on an annuity model, the press release said.\nAs per the guidelines, local bodies and Urban Development Authorities (UDAs) shall prioritise storm water drainage works on annuity model, followed by Anna Canteens, Sewerage Treatment Plants, legacy waste clearance and development of cleared legacy waste sites, construction of storm water drains and sewage drains, formation of new master plan roads/link roads, protection and improvement of lakes/ponds, development of area-level recreation facilities, protection and development of layout open spaces and other infrastructure works such as roads and street lighting.\nMA&UD Principal Secretary S. Suresh Kumar said the revised guidelines mark a decisive step towards channelising regularisation funds into high-impact urban infrastructure. By prioritising storm water drainage works on an annuity model and strengthening sewerage and waste management infrastructure, the government is addressing the structural deficits in urban infrastructure, he said.\nPublished - February 26, 2026 11:29 pm IST\nVijayawada\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

(@SunetraA_Pawar/X via PTI Photo)\nNearly a month after Nationalist Congress Party chief Ajit Pawar’s sudden death, the party’s national conference on Thursday (February 26, 2026) unanimously elected his widow Sunetra Pawar as his successor, while his son Parth Pawar was chosen to represent the party in the Rajya Sabha.\nAlso Read | No opposition to Sunetra Pawar becoming NCP legislature party leader: Praful Patel\nPraful Patel was re-elected as the NCP’s national working president, while Sunil Tatkare was unanimously re-elected as the president of the party’s Maharashtra unit. It was Mr. Patel who moved the motion to propose Ms. Pawar as national president, seconded by Mr. Tatkare.\nAccepting the position in an emotional speech, Ms. Pawar said that while the new responsibility might be challenging for her, it would not be impossible. “Politics and social life are not new for me. I have lived with a storm named Ajit Pawar for 40 years. I have been connected with NCP, directly or indirectly over the last several years,” she said.\nHighlighting a vision for the party, she said it needed to spread in the urban areas, asking the NCP cadres to focus on women. “Shiv, Shahu, Phule, Ambedkar ideology was always followed by Ajit Dada and he never compromised on it. We too are never going to compromise on it. We will never leave any section of society behind and we will always walk together,” she said.\nSpeaking of her personal grief, she said she had kept it aside for the welfare of the State. “Only Jay and Parth are not my family. The entire NCP is my family,” she said, adding that a void had been created by Dada’s demise.\nNCP leader and cabinet minister Chhagan Bhujbal expressed confidence that Ms. Pawar would prove herself in the role, though the responsibility might be new to her. “She has given her speech in three languages today. She has given an apt reply to those who criticised her as ‘gungi gudiya’. That was the criticism against Indira Gandhi in the early years. But we all saw how she proved them wrong,” he said. He added that there was nothing wrong with the family seeking a thorough probe into Ajit Pawar’s death.\nMr. Patel claimed that efforts were made to dictate terms to the party after Ajit Pawar’s demise. “We all see the kind of politics played by others after his death. They tried to dictate how we should run our party. We know how to take the right decisions at the right time,” he said.\nMr. Tatkare referred to the political developments of 2014, when he said that NCP founder Sharad Pawar had asked the party leaders to support the BJP from outside. “Several incidents happened after that. When [Ajit Pawar] finally decided to join the NDA in 2023, we all stood by him without compromising on our ideals,” he said.\nPublished - February 26, 2026 11:28 pm IST\nMaharashtra\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        state politics\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

File\n                                          | Photo Credit: The Hindu\nThe Congress on Thursday (February 26, 2026) claimed the Supreme Court of India is “rightly agitated” over the NCERT textbook for class 8 and accused the Centre of orchestrating an “RSS-driven exercise full of mischief and malice” in the rewriting of school textbooks.\nAlso read: Supreme Court NCERT hearing highlights\nCongress communication chief Jairam Ramesh made these remarks after the Supreme Court of India imposed a ban on a Class 8 NCERT social science textbook that contained references to corruption in the judiciary.\n“The Supreme Court is rightly agitated over critical references to the judiciary in NCERT textbooks. Actually, the way NCERT textbooks have been rewritten over the past decade is disgraceful, apart from being dangerous,” Mr. Ramesh said in an X post.\n“It has been an RSS-driven exercise full of mischief and malice. It is this racket that needs to be investigated,”he added.\nA three-judge Bench comprising Chief Justice Surya Kant, and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M. Pancholi ordered the seizure of all physical and digital copies of the book and issued show-cause notices to the NCERT Director and the Secretary, Department of School Education, asking why contempt proceedings should not be initiated.\nThe court took suo motu cognisance of the matter after senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Abhishek Singhvi mentioned it for urgent hearing. Observing that it would not allow “anyone on earth” to tarnish the judiciary’s integrity, the Bench expressed strong disapproval of the contents.\nFollowing the court’s remarks, NCERT withdrew the textbook from its website and apologised for “inappropriate content”, stating that the chapter would be rewritten in consultation with appropriate authorities.\nPublished - February 26, 2026 11:06 pm IST\neducation\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Officials maintained that several corrective measures were already under way.\nMembers of the Karnataka Government Medical Officers’ Association (KGMOA) and other Employees’ associations have flagged long delays in revising cadre and recruitment rules, some of which have not been comprehensively updated for nearly 50 years. They have threatened to launch a phased agitation from March 11 and have given a 21-day notice to the government. The department said proposals sent to the Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms were returned with objections and are being resubmitted with modifications.\nA major grievance concerns pending seniority lists. While the lists for General Duty Medical Officers and Senior Medical Officers were last finalised in 2009 and 2012 respectively, several cadres have not seen revisions for years. The department attributed this to the lack of consolidated service records and said a provisional list published in 2024 could not be finalised due to objections and incomplete district data. Promotions are currently being granted based on provisional lists under Rule 32, an official statement said.\nOfficials added that a second Chief Administrative Officer post was created to expedite service matters and that 450 doctors have received time-bound promotions. Human resource data are being digitised under HRMS-2.0.\nOn demands for deputation to higher studies, the government said such sponsorship is not a fundamental right and is limited to 5% of sanctioned posts, based on service needs, particularly in rural areas.\nPublished - February 26, 2026 11:05 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

During the course of the hearing, the Division Bench asked how the court can decide the case without viewing the film whose teaser and trailer allegedly have content derogatory to Kerala. (The single judge had sought to see the film, which the filmmakers allegedly remained non-committal about) The court also sought a clarification whether the pleas were normal writ petitions or PILs.\nReferring to the interim order that stayed the film’s release for a fortnight, which spoke of the  Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) alleged non-application of mind while issuing the censor certificate, the filmmakers contented that the certificate was issued after an expert committee, which included two social activists from Kerala, viewed the contents. Moreover, the storyline and the choice of religion being shown in the film were the prerogative of the storyteller. The film portrays a social evil attributed to a section of a particular religion in many States, and it was the State’s responsibility to ensure law and order when the movie is released, they said.\nMoreover, the film, for which huge sums had been spent, was set to be released in 1,500 theatres in India and in over 100 theatres abroad on Friday. The plea for a stay on its release was filed at the eleventh hour, it said, adding that there was no need to remove Kerala from the title, since the State’s name was mentioned in the first movie The Kerala Story as well. The women in the movie are fighting against radicalisation and there in no intention to portray Kerala in bad light, the film-makers said.\nOne of the petitioners, who hails from Kannur, said his right to reputation stood to be affected by the contents of the movie. He risked being discriminated against, just because he hailed from Kerala, since the entire State was being shown in bad light in the film.\n“There are hundreds of of similarly affected people, especially those who are settled outside Kerala. It is constitutionally impermissible to denigrate any community,”  he said, adding that releasing the movie would cause irreparable damage to Kerala’s name. He added that the claim in The Kerala Story that 32,000 Kerala women were radicalised, turned out to be false.\nPublished - February 26, 2026 10:40 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Patil\n                                          | Photo Credit: file photo\nThe much-delayed recruitment process for government jobs is set to kick-start in Karnataka again, with the State Cabinet on Thursday deciding that the notication will be issued within the next 30 days to fill 56,432 posts across departments.\nThe notifications will come for 50% (32% for OBC, 15% for SCs and 3% for SCs) reservation matrix instead of 56% (32%, 17%, 7%) to avoid legal hurdles.\nThe recent massive protests by unemployed youth in Dharwad was over delayed recruitments, which had left the government embarrassed and given a handle to the Opposition to criticise the ruling Congress on not meeting an important electoral promise.\nWhile the Finance Department has already provided approval for 24,300 posts, new notifications will come for 32,132 posts under 371 (J) of the Constitution.\nLaw and Parliament Affairs Minister H.K. Patil, who briefed the media, said that the notifications will spell out details on internal reservation within the 15% quota for Scheduled Castes instead of 17% with 6:6:5 ratio as approved by the State government.\nThough Governor Thaawarchand Gehlot earlier in the day had given assent to The Karnataka Scheduled Castes (Sub-Classification) Bill, 2025, which pegs SC reservation at 17% and allows internal quota, the Cabinet decided to stick to the original 15%.\nWhen asked about the contradiction of the government sticking to 15% though assent was given for 17% quota, he Mr. Patil said, “Keeping in view the court judgment we will see how to go about internal reservation”.\nAsked if the government would hike reservation if the court verdict goes in favour of breaching the 50% ceiling, Mr. Patil said that adequate provisions will be made in the notificaiton to allow for this. The notification will have a clause that will allow for refitting the matrix to allow for additional 3% to SCs and 4% STs if the courts favour quota hike in the future, he said.\nEarlier in the day, a delegation of seven Karnataka Ministers met the Governor demanding early assent to the Bill that provides legislation cover to internal reservation within the 17 % reservation for 101 Scheduled Castes in Karnataka. The government had given clarifications sought by the Governor regarding the quota break-up.\nMr. Patil said that two Bills — the Karnataka Rohith Vemula (Protection of SC/STs from Caste Discrimination in Higher Educational Institutions) Bill, 2025, and The Karnataka Freedom of Choice in Marriage and Prevention and Prohibition of Crimes in the Name of Honour and Tradition Bill, 2026, had been referred to the Home Department for its opinion.\nThe Cabinet also gave approval for the Cauvery VI Stage to supply water to satellite towns of Hoskote, Nelamangala, Devanahalli, and Vijayapura among other places at a cost of ₹6,939 crore.\nPublished - February 26, 2026 10:18 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

He attributed his brother’s death to acute mental stress and difficulties he faced at the centre.\nAddressing a press conference on Thursday (February 26, 2026), BJD vice-president, Debi Prasad Mishra alleged that the BJP Government had failed miserably in paddy procurement, which had worsened the condition of farmers.\n“Due to this failure, a farmer, Trilochan Nayak, lost his life. The deceased farmer had received a token on January 16. However, 6 kilograms per quintal were deducted from his produce during the cutting and grading process. According to his family, Mr. Nayak faced repeated harassment at every stage while trying to sell his paddy,” said Mr. Mishra.\nThe BJD vice president said, “The farmer was instructed to deliver his paddy to Ramchandi Mill, but he was forced to wait there for three days to complete the procurement process. The State Supply Minister Mr. Patra, in a video message claimed that paddy procurement in the State was running smoothly, which is a blatant lie.”\n“The death of the farmer from the Rajnagar area in Kendrapara has exposed this false claim.  There were discrepancies in the Minister’s statements. In the Assembly last Tuesday, the Minister stated that 64.10 lakh metric tonnes of paddy had been procured so far. However, in a subsequent video message, he claimed that 63.65 lakh metric tonnes had been procured. Two different figures in two days proves that the Minister is misleading the public,” said Lenin Mohanty, BJD spokesperson.\nAccording to BJD leaders, 193 lakh metric tonnes of paddy, as per official statistics, have been produced in the State this year.\n“While the BJP Government had promised to procure all the paddy, only about 63 lakh metric tonnes, approximately 33% of the total production have been procured so far. Given that procurement is scheduled to continue only until March 31, it is unlikely that the government will be able to procure the remaining paddy within just one month,” they said.\nRajnagar tahsildar, Jishukhrista Das, said, “I inquired about paddy procurement from the particular farmer. Precisely, 38.92 quintal of paddy belonging to the deceased farmer had been procured earlier this month and payment had also been made accordingly.”\nFamily members of the farmer have not formally complained about the difficulties he faced during paddy procurement, said Mr. Das.\nPublished - February 26, 2026 09:52 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Union Minister Bhupender Yadav was also present.\n                                          | Photo Credit: ANI\nSumitra Chattopadhyay, a fifth-generation descendant of littérateur Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, on Thursday (February 26, 2026) joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The development comes ahead of Assembly elections in West Bengal when the BJP is highlighting the contribution of Chattopadhyay and the song Vande Mataram written by him.\nMr. Chattopadhyay, a former official with the State Labour Department, was formally welcomed into the party by BJP State president Samik Bhattacharya and Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Bhupender Yadav.\nAfter being handed over the party flag, Mr. Chattopadhyay raised serious concerns regarding the State government policy on employment generation. The new entrant in the BJP criticised the West Bengal government’s Yuva Sathi scheme, which promises an unemployment allowance of ₹1,500 per month. He pointed out that the Trinamool Congress had discontinued a similar project, the Yuvashree scheme.\n“Data of lakhs of youth associated with the employment exchange were deleted through an administrative order and replaced with the formation of an ‘employment bank’, where approximately 4 million youth were registered. Subsequently, the Yuvashree scheme was introduced, which was later discontinued,” Mr. Chattopadhyay said.\nIn September 2025, Sumitra Chattopadhyay and another descendant of Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, Sajal Chattopadhyay, had joined Mr. Bhattacharya in raising the neglect of the ancestral house of the writer.\nWelcoming Sumitra Chattopadhyay into the party, Union Minister Bhupender Yadav said that Vande Mataram, composed by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, strengthened the spirit of nationalism and patriotism across the country.\nThe BJP leadership, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah, have repeatedly reflected on the contributions of Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay and particularly Vande Mataram. A discussion was held in Parliament in December 2025 to mark 150 years of Vande Mataram.\nPublished - February 26, 2026 09:51 pm IST\nWest Bengal\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Kolkata\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Bharatiya Janata Party\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

File\n                                          | Photo Credit: The Hindu\nThe Supreme Court on Thursday (February 26, 2026) said there was a “deep-rooted conspiracy” behind the “very, very calculated move” to portray the judiciary as a venal institution in a Class 8 Social Science textbook.\nThe textbook was published by the National Council of Education Research and Training (NCERT), an autonomous organisation under the Ministry of Education, in February.\nA three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice of India Surya Kant, in a suo motu case hearing, said the “reckless, irresponsible, motivated, contemptuous conduct and manner” of the textual depiction was meant to instil a bias against the judiciary in the “impressionable minds” of young school children, and through them, to the society at large and even future generations.\nSupreme Court hearing on NCERT Class 8 textbook: Follow updates on February 26, 2026\nThe Bench said that “heads must roll”. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for a contrite Union government, said, “All of us are holding our heads in shame,” and offered the court an unconditional and unqualified apology.\nMr. Mehta said the people who worked on the textbook would never be assigned the task again by the Education Ministry. If he had his way, Mr. Mehta added, they would not be employed by any other Ministry either.\nBut these statements did not seem to assuage the court. Ordering a “blanket and complete” ban on the book, the Bench ordered the immediate seizure and sealing of each and every copy, both in digital and physical form.\nInitiating contempt action, the court issued a show cause notice to both the Secretary of the Department of School Education and Literacy, Ministry of Education, and the NCERT Director, Dinesh Prasad Saklani, whom the court said had “defended” the “offensive content” even when the Supreme Court Secretary General, on the instruction of Chief Justice Kant, had sought an explanation.\n“They fired the gun and the judiciary is bleeding today,” Chief Justice Kant said, addressing the law officer.\nThe court said that, prima facie, an examination of the book’s contents and the response from the director, seemed like a calculated move to undermine the institutional authority and demean the dignity of the judiciary. The Bench said, in its order, that the publication “washed off with one stroke of the pen the illustrious history associated with the Supreme Court, the High Courts” and their substantive contributions towards the preservation of democratic values.\n“The text fails to mention the imperative role of the judiciary in upholding constitutional morality and basic structure which is the lifeblood of the Indian citizenry. The narrative of the book chooses not to delve into any of the transformative measures or initiatives to overhaul even the legal aid and streamline the ease of access to justice mechanism. This silence is particularly egregious given the sheer volume of high ranking officers who have been censured by this very court in the past for corrupt practices, fraudulent activities,” the Bench noted.\nChief Justice Kant said the court would not let the issue fade into oblivion after a word of apology from the government or the NCERT.\n“This is a well-orchestrated and planned move. I would like to have a deeper probe. As the head of the judiciary, it is my duty to find out who is responsible. If there are more than one, heads must roll. Accountability must be there. I am not going to close this proceeding till I am satisfied,” the Chief Justice told the Union government.\nSenior members of the Bar, including senior advocates Kapil Sibal, A.M. Singhvi, and Supreme Court Bar Association president Vikas Singh, agreed that the content was “definitely deliberate”.\n“The book will not remain confined to students only. Its contents are bound to travel from teacher to pupil to parent and to the entire society, including the next generation… It may have a lasting impact on judicial independence. Such misconduct falls within criminal contempt. If this conduct  proves to be deliberate, it will amount to scandalising the institution and bring it to disrepute,” the court observed.\nThe court clarified that its suo motu registration of the case should not be construed as a move to stifle legitimate criticism of public institutions, including the judiciary.\n“We are of the firm opinion that dissent, deliberation, rigorous discourse are vital to democracy and serve as essential instruments of institutional accountability. The necessity to judicial intervention has arisen to safeguard the pedagogical integrity. Young students in their formative years are only beginning to navigate the nuances of public life and the constitutional architecture that sustains it. It is fundamentally improper to expose them to a biased narrative that may engender permanent misconceptions at this tender age,” the Supreme Court underscored.\nPublished - February 26, 2026 09:20 pm IST\nSupreme Court\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        laws\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        education\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Three of them were brought to Delhi in the early hours of Friday from Himachal Pradesh on transit remand.\nAmong those arrested, IYC president Uday Bhanu Chib and National Secretary Shri Krishna Hari are suspected to be the masterminds behind the protest.\nOfficers familiar with the probe said Hari’s bank account is linked to the IYC’s account and has received funds on multiple occasions.\n“We are examining how and when the money was spent and for what purposes,\" another officer said, also requesting anonymity.\nThe February 20 protest was staged at Bharat Mandapam on the final day of the AI Summit, in the lobby area of Hall Number Five.\nFour persons, National Secretary Krishna Hari, who hails from Bihar; Bihar state secretary Kundan Yadav; Eastern Uttar Pradesh vice president Ajai Kumar; and Narsimha Yadav from Telangana, were initially arrested at the spot, while a search was launched for others involved.\nOn Tuesday, the investigation into the protest was handed over to the Delhi Police Crime Branch.\nThe same day, Special Commissioner of Police (Crime Branch) Devesh Srivastava addressed the media and said the protesters attempted to breach the security cordon in front of visitors at the AI Summit, during which some police personnel were injured.\nHe added that the involvement of several individuals had been confirmed at the preliminary stage of the probe.\n“CCTV footage was examined, and some individuals who had provided assistance were identified. Office bearers of the Indian Youth Congress are also involved in the case,\" the officer said.\nFollowing the February 20 incident, Delhi Police registered a case under various sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), including Sections 61(2) (criminal conspiracy), 121(1) (voluntarily causing hurt or grievous hurt to deter a public servant from duty), 132 (assault or criminal force to deter a public servant from discharge of duty), 195(1) (assaulting or obstructing a public servant while suppressing a riot), 221 (obstructing a public servant in discharge of public functions), 223(A) (disobedience to an order duly promulgated by a public servant), 190 (unlawful assembly), 196 (promoting enmity between groups), 197 (acts prejudicial to national integration), and 3(5) (common intention).\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "Fewer Trackside Signals, Kavach: How Indian Railways Is Clearing The Tracks For 160 Kmph Travel",
        "content": "The “superfast\" mission looks a step closer for Indian Railways, which has undertaken a modernisation initiative to facilitate high-speed travel up to 160 kmph.\nThis will be reflected in how the railways manages its traffic: a move towards fewer trackside signals and a significant increase in the distance between them, as well as thorough Kavach implementation.\nAccording to a report published by the Times of India, to ensure the safety of these faster journeys, the Railway Board has approved a proposal to double the distance between signals from the current 1 km to 2 km.\nThe report said this adjustment is a vital safety enhancement, as when the trains reach speeds of 160 kmph, the physics of braking dramatically change. This will require a longer stretch of track to decelerate and make a safe stop.\nIt said by spacing signals 2 km apart, the railways will provide locomotive pilots with a longer braking window and earlier warnings. Experts said this will significantly reduce the need for the abrupt, sudden braking that can compromise both safety and passenger comfort.\nThe Times of India reported that before this is implemented across the vast national network, it will undergo rigorous testing. A pilot project managed by Southern Railway has been given the “green light\" to prepare a detailed proposal for the Railway Board.\nIt said if this pilot proves successful in maintaining safety while facilitating higher speeds, the system is expected to be rolled out nationwide with other zones like the North Central Railway already identified for future expansion. This initiative has been solidified following high-level consultations between the additional member (traction) and zonal principal chief electrical engineers, culminating in a pivotal meeting on January 27, where the 2-km spacing was officially suggested.\nThe shift away from traditional trackside (or “wayside\") signals represents a major technological leap.\nHistorically, the railways has relied on physical signals — essentially sophisticated “traffic lights\" on poles — that a locomotive pilot must visually spot. This system, however, will prove to be a hurdle as the network aims for higher speeds.\nAt speeds exceeding 130 kmph, the “sighting distance\" — the time between a driver seeing a signal and reaching it — becomes dangerously short. This problem is worsened by external factors such as heavy rain, sharp curves, or the thick fog common in North India, which often forces drivers to slow down because they cannot see the signal clearly.\nTo overcome these constraints, the railways is transitioning to “cab signalling\". Under this system, the signal aspect (red, yellow, or green) is directly displayed on a screen inside the locomotive cockpit.\nThis allows the train to maintain its top speed regardless of external visibility or weather conditions, effectively moving the “intelligence\" of the railway from the ground into the train.\nThe primary driver of speed upgrade is the implementation of Kavach, India’s indigenous automatic train protection (ATP) system, alongside ETCS Level 2 (European Train Control System).\nKavach acts as an electronic “shield\", creating a digital communication bubble around every train to prevent collisions. The system operates through a sophisticated “digital handshake\" between several components.\n\n\nThis allows the railways to move from “fixed blocks\" — where only one train can occupy a set section of track — to optimised or “moving\" blocks. By knowing the exact position and braking distance of every train via radio communication, the gap between trains can be safely reduced, allowing more trains to run at higher speeds without waiting for a physical “all clear\" from a distant pole.\nKavach also introduces continuous speed supervision. Unlike physical signals, which are “static\" and only tell a driver to “stop\" or “go\", it provides a continuous speed curve.\nThe system calculates the train’s weight, the track’s gradient, and the distance to the next restriction to determine the exact moment braking is required. If a conflict is detected, Kavach initiates a three-stage safety protocol.\n\n\nAdditionally, it includes a network-wide SOS feature. If an accident occurs, a pilot can press an SOS button, sending a radio signal that automatically slows or stops every other train within a several-kilometre radius, preventing secondary collisions on adjacent tracks.\nBeyond speed and safety, reducing trackside signals offers significant cost and maintenance benefits.\nPhysical signal posts are expensive to install and prone to failure, theft, or damage. Each signal requires extensive wiring, power, and individual maintenance.\nBy contrast, it is far more cost-effective to maintain a network of radio towers for Kavach and ETCS than thousands of individual signal lamps and hundreds of kilometres of copper signalling cables. This reduction in a “signal failure\" is expected to significantly improve the punctuality of the network.\nAs of February, the rollout of Kavach 4.0 has significantly accelerated. The project is focused on two critical high-speed corridors under ‘Mission Raftar’.\n\n\nAccording to the ministry of railways, the vendor base has expanded to over five companies in 2026, shifting the pace from experimental to mass production. With over 1,300 route kilometres already commissioned and more than 4,150 locomotives fitted with Kavach, the full activation of this system remains the final “permission slip\" needed to officially raise the speed limit to 160 kmph across these vital corridors.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "\n\n\nThe Assam Cabinet has decided to formally approach the Gauhati High Court seeking the constitution of a fast-track court to hear the high-profile death case of popular Assamese singer Zubeen Garg. The move follows mounting public pressure and demands from the singer’s family for a speedy trial.\n\nAnnouncing the decision after a Cabinet meeting on February 26, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said the state government would request the Chief Justice of the Gauhati High Court to facilitate day-to-day hearings to ensure swift justice.\n\n“The Assam Cabinet has decided to recommend or formally request the Gauhati High Court to constitute a fast-track court for the trial in the death case of popular Assamese singer Zubeen Garg. This move aims to expedite proceedings and ensure timely, day-to-day hearings for swift justice,\" Sarma said.\n\nThe case has drawn widespread attention across Assam, with opposition parties, civil society organisations, and prominent individuals repeatedly demanding faster judicial progress. A regional political party had also announced plans to launch an agitation over delays in the case.\n\nHowever, some political voices have raised concerns over whether shifting the matter to a fast-track court could have implications for bail conditions or ongoing legal proceedings.\n\n\n\nIn a related development, the Gauhati High Court has ordered the reopening of a packaged drinking water unit linked to Siddharth Sarma, one of the prime accused in the case. Sarma, who served as Garg’s manager, faces allegations of mismanagement and alleged misappropriation of the singer’s funds.\n\nThe water plant Mahavir Aqua (also referred to as Mahabir Aqua) — located in an industrial area near Guwahati, had been sealed by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) during the probe. Investigators suspect that funds allegedly siphoned from Garg were invested in the business, citing it as part of the possible motive in the case.\n\nA Public Interest Litigation (PIL) seeking the reopening of the plant was filed by Sarma’s associate, Chetan Dhirasia. The matter was heard on February 25, 2026.\n\nIn its order, the court observed that public welfare-oriented business operations should not remain indefinitely shut due to ongoing criminal proceedings against an individual. The bench stressed the need to balance the interests of justice with broader community and economic considerations.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Siddharth Sarma, event manager Shyamkanu Mahanta, co-signer Amritprabha Mahanta, accompanist Sekhar Goswami, and other accused individuals remain in judicial custody.\n\nObservers noted that during recent court appearances, the accused appeared composed, with no visible display of remorse.\n\nThe case continues to generate significant public and political interest as calls grow louder for a time-bound trial and accountability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "New Book Delves Into Ancient Hindu Glory, Seeks To Rekindle The 'Flame Of Resistance'",
        "content": "At a time when debates around India’s civilisational past are often framed through the lens of decline and disruption, a new book seeks to shift the narrative towards rediscovering lost grandeur and drawing lessons for the future. The Decline of the Hindu Civilisation by Shashi Ranjan Kumar reconstructs the intellectual brilliance, scientific achievements and spiritual depth of ancient India, arguing that the civilisation’s enduring “flame of resistance\" ensured its continued relevance despite repeated upheavals. Rather than dwelling solely on decay, the book positions the past as a source of renewal — suggesting that the road ahead lies in understanding and reclaiming civilisational confidence.\nA senior civil servant and an electrical engineering graduate from Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, Kumar writes that his journey began when he read VS Naipaul’s India: A Wounded Civilisation. The book, he says, unsettled his early understanding of Hindu civilisation. But as he turned to primary sources and comparative historical study, Kumar came to see the “wound\" not as fatal, but as a reminder of resilience — a civilisational continuity that refused to be extinguished. Through deep research and comparisons with other great cultures, he examines whether internal rigidities, political fissures or external invasions best explain periods of decline, even as he foregrounds the enduring strength that survived them.\nStructured in four parts and sixteen chapters, the book re-evaluates Indian history from what Kumar describes as an indigenous perspective, challenging colonial and Marxist frameworks. The first part, comprising eight chapters, offers a comparative study of ancient Indian, Greco-Roman and Chinese civilisations. It draws parallels between institutions such as Nalanda and Alexandria, and devotes detailed chapters to astronomy, mathematics and medicine. Kumar revisits the “sciences of the Hindus,\" comparing Indian cosmological models with Greek thought, and highlighting contributions such as Aryabhata’s astronomical insights, the formalisation of zero, and the early foundations of calculus developed by the Kerala school.\nThe book also addresses civilisational self-perception. Kumar argues that “Bharat\" — or the Idea of India — is not a 19th-century construct but finds clear articulation in ancient texts such as the Puranas, which describe a culturally unified geography. He challenges the claim that “Hinduism\" was merely a British-era invention, contending instead that it represents a long-standing civilisational continuum. According to him, India’s historical trajectory is marked by wounds that “refuse to heal,\" accompanied by what he calls a stubborn denial of past humiliations. Yet this very continuity, he suggests, is proof of resilience rather than rupture.\nA substantial section of the book analyses five key battles — from the Battle of Hydaspes to the Battle of Assaye — to understand recurring military setbacks. Kumar attributes these to tactical inflexibility, lack of political unity and delayed adaptation to changing technologies of warfare. He also contests Sheldon Pollock’s thesis on the “death of Sanskrit,\" arguing that Sanskrit intellectual culture remained vibrant in regions such as the Sena and Gahadavala kingdoms until the onset of foreign invasions.\nDrawing comparisons with the Roman, Greco-Roman and Chinese civilisations, Kumar notes that while several great empires collapsed or were entirely replaced, Hindu civilisation retained a living core. That persistent “flame of resistance,\" he argues, prevented total extinguishment and preserved cultural memory through centuries of turmoil.\nThe book ultimately returns to its central proposition: that the past is not merely a chronicle of defeats but a reservoir of inspiration. By revisiting ancient achievements and honestly examining historical setbacks, Kumar suggests that India can shape a future worthy of its civilisational inheritance — one that generations to come will regard with pride.\nLatest Blogs",

At the time, the amount was considered substantial and was reportedly provided to support wartime administration in the princely state of Bhopal.\nNow, more than a century later, Seth Jummalal’s grandson, Vivek Ruthia, said he is preparing to send a legal notice to the British government to recover the loan which was never repaid. He said that the documentary evidence of the transaction was recently discovered among old family records following his father’s death.\nThe document, dated June 4, 1917, stated that Seth Jumma Lal, of the firm Seth Rama Kishan Jaskaran Ruthia, “subscribed Rs 35,000 to the Indian War Loan and thereby showed his loyalty to the Government and Empire.\" It beares the signature of W S Davis, who was then the political agent in Bhopal.\nWar loans during that period were debt instruments issued by the British government to raise funds for military expenses during World War I, typically offering 5.5% interest.\nSeth Jummalal Ruthia died in 1937, nearly 20 years after the loan was extended. The matter, the family claimed, remained unsettled and gradually slipped into obscurity until now.\nRuthia said that he is consulting lawyers to explore whether a claim can be made against the current UK government.\n“It’s not just about money, it’s about justice and history,\" he said, adding that when adjusted for compound interest, inflation or gold prices, the original Rs 35,000 could now be worth several crores of rupees.\nThe Ruthia family was once among the most prominent and affluent in Sehore and the Bhopal princely state, with significant landholdings and business interests. Seth Jumma Lal Ruthia was a prominent trader in cloth and grain in Sehore during British rule. At the time of World War I, when the colonial administration was facing financial strain, local officials reportedly approached him for assistance.\nThey family continues to own property in Sehore, Indore and Bhopal.\nLegal experts note that claims involving pre-Independence transactions between colonial authorities and private individuals are rare and legally complex. While no legal notice has yet been sent, the family said that it is determined to pursue the matter.\nLatest Blogs",

India has put 45 Special Forces personnel on the ground, soldiers trained for high-altitude infiltration through HALO and HAHO jumps, covert reconnaissance, and counter-terrorism operations in terrain that defeats most conventional units.\nTraining with them are 12 soldiers from the US Army’s Green Berets, specifically one full Operational Detachment Alpha, or ODA. An ODA is the core unit of Green Beret operations, with each soldier holding a specialist role in weapons, medicine, communications, or engineering. The exercise is focussed on joint mission planning, tactical drills, and building the kind of trust that makes two different armies function as one.\nAlongside “Vajra Prahar\", Exercise Dharma Guardian 2026 is also underway at the Foreign Training Node in Chaubattia, Uttarakhand. This is the 7th edition of India’s joint military exercise with Japan and will continue till March 9.\nIndian Army troops and soldiers from the Japanese Ground Self-Defence Force are working through counterinsurgency and jungle warfare drills, reinforcing a defence relationship that has been picking up real momentum in recent years.\nDown south, Exercise “Kalari Leap\" was held across the Lakshadweep and Minicoy archipelago, with landings at by special forces teams at Agatti airport. This was a high-tempo joint maritime exercise involving the Indian Air Force’s Southern Air Command, the Armed Forces Special Operations Division, and the Indian Coast Guard. The exercise brought together airborne insertions, amphibious assaults, anti-ship strikes, and maritime search and rescue operations. Platforms deployed included the An-32 transport aircraft, Mi-17V5 helicopters, and Su-30MKI fighter jets. Coast Guard ships, Gemini boats, and Dornier 228 aircraft rounded out the force package. AFSOD special forces executed Combat Free Fall insertions and amphibious assault missions as part of the drill. The exercise tested India’s ability to project coordinated air, maritime, and special operations forces across its island territories simultaneously.\nAnd then there is Vayu Shakti. On February 27, the Indian Air Force is scheduled to hold its annual firepower demonstration at the Pokhran range in Rajasthan. Fighter jets and precision munitions in a live-fire showcase that needs no translation. President Droupadi Murmu is also scheduled to attend the exercise as part of her two-day visit to Jaisalmer from February 26 to 27. According to the official programme, the President is set to fly in the indigenously developed Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) ‘Prachand’ on Friday and shall conduct an aerial survey of the exercise area.\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "'Corruption In Judiciary' Chapter: NCERT Apologises, Retracts Class 8 Social Science Textbook",
        "content": "The NCERT on Wednesday issued an official apology and said it will retract the new social science textbook for Class 8, which mentioned a chapter on “corruption in judiciary\".\nThe chapter attracted sharp criticism from the Supreme Court, following which the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) said it has put the textbook’s distribution on hold.\nAccording to a press release, the NCERT will be rewriting the curriculum of the textbook in question – Exploring Society: India and Beyond, Vol II, which was officially released on February 24. Within hours of its release, the book was taken off the council’s website and all physical circulation was stopped after the SC expressed its “ire\" over the content, which it deemed defamatory and an affront to the integrity of the legal system.\nA three-judge bench, comprising Chief Justice of India Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi, took suo motu cognisance of the “objectionable\" statements regarding the judiciary. The matter was brought to the court’s attention for urgent consideration by senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Abhishek Singhvi.\nDuring the proceedings, CJI Surya Kant issued a stern warning stating that “nobody on earth will be allowed to defame the judiciary and taint its integrity\".\nIn a swift response, the NCERT released a statement acknowledging that “certain inappropriate textual material and error of judgement have inadvertently crept into\" Chapter 4, titled ‘The Role of Judiciary in our Society’.\nIt said the inclusion of such material was “purely unintentional\" and expressed deep regret for the oversight. The ministry of education, through the department of school education and literacy, intervened in the matter and ordered the distribution of the textbook to be on “strict hold\" until further notice.\nThe NCERT further said it holds the judiciary in the “highest esteem\", viewing the institution as the “upholder of the Indian Constitution and protector of Fundamental Rights\". It said the primary objective of its new textbooks is to “strengthen constitutional literacy, institutional respect, and informed understanding of democratic participation amongst students\", rather than questioning the authority of constitutional bodies.\nThe controversial chapter had listed corruption, along with a massive backlog of cases and an inadequate number of judges, as significant challenges currently facing the Indian judicial system.\nTo rectify the situation, the NCERT has announced that the curriculum will be completely rewritten. This process will involve close consultation with “appropriate authorities\" to ensure the material is accurate and respectful of the country’s institutions.\nThe revised version of the textbook is expected to be made available to Class 8 students in time for the commencement of the 2026-27 academic session.\nThe textbook noted that judges are bound by a code of conduct and that mechanisms exist to address complaints, including the Centralised Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System, which received over 1,600 complaints between 2017 and 2021.\nIt also explained that Parliament has the authority to impeach judges after due inquiry in cases of serious misconduct. The book stated that corruption experienced at various levels of the judiciary could affect access to justice, particularly for disadvantaged sections and highlighted efforts to improve transparency.\nThe previous Class 8 textbook published by NCERT explained the structure, role and independence of the judiciary but did not mention corruption as a challenge.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "Tension briefly gripped a village in Bihar’s Bhojpur district after allegations of forced religious conversion surfaced, prompting police intervention and an official inquiry that has so far found no evidence to support the claims.\nThe incident occurred on Monday, February 23, in Chatar village under the Barhara police station area, where residents of Pakdiya Tola and Bind Toli accused a man, locally known as ‘Pani Wale Baba’, of encouraging villagers to change their religion under the guise of healing rituals involving water.\nAccording to villagers, the man was allegedly distributing religious literature said to have been brought from Nepal and speaking about religious conversion. As word spread, anger grew among local residents, who alleged that members of the Mahadalit community were being misled in the name of treatment and miracles. Some local activist groups were also informed, leading to a gathering of people and a brief period of unrest in the area.\nHowever, several women present at the site rejected the allegations, stating that the man had only been treating people with water-based rituals and had not promoted any religious conversion.\nFollowing information about the incident, a team from Barhara police station reached the village and began questioning residents. The man is reportedly a native of Muzaffarpur and is believed to be associated with Christianity. When police attempted to take him for questioning, some women allegedly protested and pushed the personnel, allowing the man to leave. The situation remained tense for some time, forcing the police team to withdraw.\nHowever, acting on the instructions of the SP, SDPO (Sadar-2) Ranjit Kumar Singh visited the village, interacted with residents and conducted an enquiry. Singh said no concrete evidence of religious conversion had been found so far. According to Singh, the man had visited the village for treatment purposes and several women recorded statements in his support.\nUnder existing laws, forced or induced religious conversion is a punishable offence, and police action can be initiated only after proper investigation. Officials said that no confirmed case of religious conversion has been registered at Barhara police station so far.\nThe incident continues to be discussed among villagers, with some describing it as a rumour while others have demanded a thorough probe. Police have appealed to residents to maintain peace and avoid drawing conclusions before the investigation is completed.\nLatest Blogs",

At the super speciality hospital campus in Chamyana, a stray dog was seen roaming with a human leg in its mouth, triggering shock and outrage.\nA video of the incident later went viral on social media.\n\n\nAccording to reports, a 61-year-old man underwent surgery at the hospital on February 19, during which his leg was amputated. The severed limb was placed in a sealed envelope and stored in a designated room.\nThe hospital administration had granted permission to an authorised organisation to collect and transfer the amputated limb. However, no representative from the organisation arrived to take custody of it. As a result, the limb remained stored in the hospital premises.\n\n\nOn February 22, hospital staff were removing trolleys from the storage room. During the process, the door was reportedly left open and was not locked afterwards. Later that night, strong winds caused the door to swing open, allowing a stray dog to enter the room and carry away the sealed envelope containing the limb.\nThe following day, February 23, staff discovered an empty envelope near the store and realised the amputated leg was missing. Shortly afterwards, the limb was seen in the mouth of a stray dog within the hospital campus, and the footage quickly circulated online.\nलापरवाही की हद! किसकी थी वो टांग, जिसे शिमला के सरकारी अस्पताल में मुंह में दबाकर घूमता रहा कुत्ता, जांच में खुलासाFull Story Link: https://t.co/bTp8bNL0aG https://t.co/4B4OokjU7F— Vinod Katwal (@Katwal_Vinod) February 25, 2026\n\n\nA fact-finding committee was constituted to investigate the incident. The committee has identified negligence in biomedical waste management procedures.

He stated that security personnel attempted to retrieve the limb from the stray dog, but the animal reportedly became aggressive, preventing them from doing so immediately.\nThe incident has raised serious concerns over safety protocols and the handling of biomedical waste within the hospital premises.\nLatest Blogs",

Indian Railways has announced that it will introduce a single app called RailOne to bring several railway services together.\nFrom March 1, this year, passengers will not be able to use the existing UTS app to book unreserved tickets or renew season passes. The move is part of a larger plan to simplify digital services and reduce the need for multiple railway apps.\nRailOne Will Bring All Booking Services Together\nRight now, passengers depend on different apps for different needs. One app is used for reserved tickets, another for unreserved tickets, and others for inquiries. RailOne is being introduced to combine all these services in one place.\nThrough RailOne, passengers will be able to:\n– Book reserved train tickets\n– Book unreserved tickets\n– Buy platform tickets\n– Check live train running status\n– Track PNR status\n– Get travel updates and railway information\nThe aim is to make ticket booking simpler and more convenient.

        "content": "Amid power-sharing tensions and speculation over a Cabinet reshuffle, 24 Members of the Legislative Council (MLCs) from the Karnataka Congress have sought representation in the state Cabinet.\nThe MLCs submitted a memorandum to AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge, urging that Council members be given adequate space in the ministry. The signatories had reportedly travelled to Delhi in December to press their case before the party high command.\n\n\nThe move comes as discussions continue over Cabinet reconstitution and internal balancing within the government.\nIn their memorandum, the MLCs said the absence of Council members in the Cabinet has created a sense of inequality and demoralisation. They argued that continued exclusion could create a perception that MLCs have limited political prospects, which may weaken the party’s organisational structure over time.\nThey also warned of a ripple effect. Capable leaders may prefer to seek Assembly tickets instead of contesting Council elections, which could fuel factionalism and erode grassroots strength.\n\n\nThe signatories said the Karnataka Legislative Council, established in 1907, is among the oldest in the country. They pointed out that MLCs represent large regions, often covering 10 to 15 Assembly constituencies, and that members elected from local bodies maintain direct engagement with grassroots institutions.\nThey stated that, compared to MLAs, MLCs often influence a broader cross-section of voters and play a key role in strengthening the party’s organisational network. They also noted that Graduates’ and Teachers’ constituency MLCs represent 15 to 20 Assembly segments and regularly engage with opinion leaders such as educators and graduates.\nAccording to the memorandum, these members help mobilise youth and intellectual support for the Congress, while teachers, as respected community influencers, shape public perception in favour of the party.\n\n\nThe MLCs have urged the high command to induct at least five Council members in the next Cabinet reshuffle. They suggested balanced representation, including one member from local bodies, one from Graduates’ or Teachers’ constituencies, and one from nominated or other categories.\nThey said meaningful Cabinet representation is essential to ensure organisational cohesion and balanced political representation within the government.\nLatest Blogs",

With this, the total supplementary expenditure for the financial year 2025-26 has reached Rs 1.45 lakh crore.

The biggest allocation in the current list is Rs 4,792 crore for the Solar Agricultural Pump Scheme. The amount will be used to transfer a loan received from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company (MahaVitaran). The scheme aims to support farmers with solar-powered pumps and reduce dependence on conventional power.\nA provision of Rs 3,112 crore has been made to provide electricity tariff concessions to agricultural pump users, power loom operators and textile consumers. Under the Jal Jeevan Mission, Rs 1,431 crore has been earmarked as the state’s share towards the central scheme.

        "content": "The ‘India AI Impact Summit 2026’ brought together policymakers and technology leaders from across the world, spotlighting how artificial intelligence is reshaping governance, economies, and societies.\nAmong the global voices in attendance was Bolivia, a country rich in natural resources and increasingly focused on leveraging science, technology, and innovation to drive sustainable and inclusive development.\nOn the sidelines of the summit, CNN-News18 had a chat with Omar Alfredo Peñaloza Escalera, who is the vice-minister of science and technology at the ministry of development planning in Bolivia. He spoke about La Paz’s growing engagement with India, the promise of South-South cooperation in emerging technologies, and how partnerships in AI can help build domestic capacity rather than deepen global inequalities.\nExcerpts from the interview:\nMinister, Bolivia has traditionally focused on extractive industries and basic technology sectors. How does participation in the India AI Impact Summit fit into Bolivia’s broader science and technology strategy?\nBolivia’s participation in the India AI Impact Summit reflects our broader policy of steadily strengthening science, technology, and innovation as key drivers of sustainable development. We are committed to transforming our productive sectors by adopting emerging technologies, diversifying the economy, and creating greater value.\nIndia is a strategic partner from the Global South, with a strong track record in digital innovation and inclusive technological solutions. Our presence here shows Bolivia’s intent to learn from successful models, encourage knowledge exchange, and build partnerships that ultimately improve the lives of our people.\nArtificial intelligence can deepen global inequalities if mismanaged. How is Bolivia ensuring that Al collaborations with India will build domestic capacity rather than create dependency?\nBolivia views international cooperation as a partnership built on mutual respect, complementarity, and joint capacity-building. In the field of AI, our focus is on developing human talent, ensuring technology transfer, and strengthening institutions.\nThe goal is to create solutions tailored to Bolivia’s own realities, while promoting technological sovereignty and responsible data governance. Our cooperation with India is designed to build domestic capacity, not dependency, so that the benefits of AI support inclusive and sustainable development.\nAdvanced AI relies heavily on high-performance chips and semiconductors. Does Bolivia plan to collaborate with India on developing or accessing AI hardware?\nWe recognise the strategic importance of technological infrastructure for advancing AI. Bolivia is open to exploring cooperation mechanisms that improve access to advanced computing capabilities, encourage technical knowledge-sharing, and enable participation in initiatives linked to specialised AI hardware.\nFrom a complementary partnership perspective, we see opportunities to deepen dialogue in areas of shared interest, including technology innovation connected to strategic resources and the strengthening of technical capabilities in emerging sectors.\nFinally, during your visit to India and interactions with Indian counterparts, what were your key takeaways?\nThe visit highlighted the remarkable dynamism of India’s technology ecosystem and its strong commitment to using innovation as a tool for inclusion and development. It also reinforced the value of South-South cooperation as an effective way to tackle shared challenges.\nWe especially appreciated the openness and willingness of our Indian counterparts to expand collaboration in areas such as applied AI, digital transformation of public services, and institutional strengthening. We leave with a strong sense that this relationship can grow into a long-term strategic partnership built on trust, respect, and mutual benefit.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday hit back at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over his defence of the shirtless protest at the AI Impact Summit, with Union Minister Pralhad Joshi accusing the Congress of hypocrisy and being “far away from reality\".\nResponding to Gandhi’s remarks justifying the Indian Youth Congress’ shirtless protest during a high-profile AI summit, Joshi said attempts to label the disruption as a “peaceful protest\" were aimed at hiding irresponsible conduct that embarrassed India on a global stage.\nIn a post on X, the minister said such actions stood in sharp contrast to Congress’ repeated claims of patriotism.\n“The statements made attempting to justify the disgraceful disruption at Bharat Mandapam only expose the contradiction and hypocrisy at the core of Congress politics,\" Joshi said.\nHe added that the reaction of ordinary people present at the venue should serve as a reminder to the party that it was disconnected from ground realities.\nJoshi further alleged that while the Congress speaks of patriotism, it repeatedly creates situations that harm India’s image internationally.\n“This is not democracy. It is one party acting against the interests of the country simply because it is not in power,\" he said, accusing the Congress of having no clear roadmap, policy direction or positive agenda for the youth.\nThe BJP’s response came after Gandhi defended the protest during a public address in Bhopal, where he praised Youth Congress members as “fearless lions\" and described them as carrying the “blood of patriotism\".\nHis remarks were aimed at countering criticism over the disruption that took place at Bharat Mandapam on February 20, when the AI impact summit was underway.\nMeanwhile, Delhi Police have arrested Indian Youth Congress (IYC) national president Uday Bhanu Chib in connection with the incident. Police sources said Chib was questioned before being formally taken into custody, taking the total number of arrests in the case to eight.\nOn Monday, three other IYC members, Jitendra Yadav, Raja Gujar and Vimal Ajay Kumar, were also arrested, while four others had been detained earlier.\nAccording to police, the incident occurred around 12.30 pm inside a hall hosting the AI Impact Expo.\nThe protesters had completed online registration and entered the venue using QR codes.\nOnce inside, they allegedly removed their outer clothing, staged a shirtless protest, raised slogans and displayed politically charged messages on their T-shirts, including slogans targeting the Prime Minister.\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "'What Happens To Keralite Now?' Shashi Tharoor Quips After Govt's Nod To Rename Kerala As 'Keralam'",
        "content": "Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Tuesday reacted with wordplay after the Union Cabinet approved the renaming of Kerala as ‘Keralam’, raising a light-hearted linguistic question on what residents of the state would now be called in English.\nIn a post on X, the Thiruvananthapuram MP wondered about the future of commonly used terms such as “Keralite\" and “Keralan\".\n“All to the good, no doubt, but a small linguistic question for the Anglophones among us: what happens now to the terms ‘Keralite’ and ‘Keralan’ for the denizens of the new ‘Keralam’? ‘Keralamite’ sounds like a microbe and ‘Keralamian’ like a rare earth mineral,\" Tharoor wrote, joking that the Kerala government could consider launching a competition to coin new terms.\nEarlier in the day, the Union Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, approved the Kerala government’s proposal to officially change the state’s name to ‘Keralam’.\nTharoor, replying to an X user, wrote, “So both state and central governments have chosen the 11th century formulation of “Keralam\" over the version of far greater antiquity (“Kerala\"). They have done so to privilege the Malayalam word. Long live linguistic parochialism!\"\nThanks for this enlightening analysis @Rajmalhotrachd ! So both state and central governments have chosen the 11th century formulation of “Keralam\" over the version of far greater antiquity (“Kerala\"). They have done so to privilege the Malayalam word. Long live linguistic… https://t.co/g2b8vWg5X0— Shashi Tharoor (@ShashiTharoor) February 25, 2026\nThe decision was taken at a Cabinet meeting held at Seva Teerth, the newly inaugurated Prime Minister’s Office and Cabinet Secretariat complex.\nThe Cabinet’s approval follows a unanimous resolution passed by the Kerala Legislative Assembly on June 24, 2024, urging the Centre to amend the First Schedule of the Constitution to reflect the name ‘Keralam’, which is how the state is known in the Malayalam language.\nThe Assembly had earlier adopted a similar resolution in August 2023, but it was reintroduced after the Ministry of Home Affairs suggested certain technical modifications.\nMoving the resolution in the Assembly, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had said the demand to recognise the state as ‘Keralam’ dates back to the national freedom struggle and the movement for a unified state for Malayalam-speaking people.\nHe had appealed to the Centre to initiate the renaming process under Article 3 of the Constitution and ensure the name ‘Keralam’ is reflected across all languages listed in the Eighth Schedule.\nWith the Cabinet’s nod, the constitutional process for the name change will now move forward, even as the state heads toward Assembly elections expected in April–May, adding a political dimension to the long-standing cultural and linguistic demand.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "More than 93,000 adult women were reported missing in Maharashtra over the last two years, the Devendra Fadnavis-led government informed the Assembly in a written reply. The data has once again brought focus on the scale of the issue and the challenge before law enforcement agencies.\nIn 2024, a total of 45,662 adult women were reported missing across the state. Out of them, 30,877 were traced. In the same year, 11,316 minor girls were reported missing, and 8,475 were found. The numbers increased in 2025. According to the government, 48,278 women were reported missing during the year. Of these, 36,581 were traced. In the case of minor girls, 12,113 went missing, and 10,295 were found.\nWhile police have managed to trace a large number of missing persons, thousands remain unaccounted for each year. The figures show both the scale of the problem and the continued efforts to address it.\nALSO READ: Despite Ban, Gutkha Trade Continues In Maharashtra; Govt Says 3,173 Arrested In 2025\nTo tackle the issue, the government has been running Operation Muskaan since July 2015. The special drive focuses on tracing missing children and reuniting them with their families. Till 2024, 13 phases of Operation Muskaan were conducted across the state.\nThe 14th phase is currently underway in early 2026. As per the data shared in the Assembly, between the launch of this phase and February 16, 2026, police have traced 454 boys and 947 girls. The government also provided figures for teenagers between the ages of 15 and 18. Between 2024 and 2025, 4,989 boys and girls in this age group were reported missing. Out of them, 4,813 were traced.\nOfficials maintain that police teams are actively working on missing cases, using local intelligence, digital tracking and coordination between districts. Special focus is given to cases involving minors.\nThe data highlights a serious social concern. While many families are reunited with their loved ones, the steady rise in missing cases shows the need for stronger preventive measures, awareness, and faster response systems.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "The Union Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Tuesday approved a proposal to officially change the name of the state of Kerala to ‘Keralam’, clearing a key procedural hurdle in a move ahead of the state assembly polls.\nWith the Cabinet’s approval, the President of India will now initiate the constitutional process by referring the proposed Kerala (Alteration of Name) Bill, 2026 to the Kerala Legislative Assembly for its views, in accordance with Article 3 of the Constitution.\nOnce the state Assembly’s opinion is received, the Centre will take further steps to introduce the Bill in Parliament after obtaining the President’s recommendation.\nPM Modi hailed the decision by the Union Cabinet, calling it the “will of the people of the state.\"\n“The decision of the Union Cabinet on alteration of the name of Kerala to Keralam reflects the will of the people of the state.

        "title": "'He Saved Many Lives, But Lost His Own': Jharkhand Air Ambulance Pilot's Father Mourns Loss",
        "content": "“My son saved many lives by piloting an air ambulance, but today he has lost his life\"—For DS Bhagat, the father of the pilot who was manoeuvring the ill-fated aircraft from Ranchi to Delhi that crashed in Jharkhand’s Chatra on Monday, the pain is inexplicable.\nAs per DGCA, Captain Vivek Vikas Bhagat and six others— Captain Savrajdeep Singh, Sanjay Kumar Shaw, Dr Vikas Kumar Gupta, Sachin Kumar Mishra, Archana Devi and Dhuru Kumar—were killed in the crash.\nSpeaking to news agency ANI, DS Bhagat said his son was scheduled to meet a relative for dinner upon landing in Delhi. “His chachi [aunt] kept dinner ready for him. He told her that he will eat at home and is expected to land in Delhi at 9pm. She kept waiting till 11pm for Vikas to come. It was only then that we found out about the crash,\" he said.\nOperated by Delhi-based Redbird Airways Pvt Ltd, the Beechcraft C90 aircraft VT-AJV took off from Ranchi at 7.11pm with a patient on board. After take-off, the plane made contact with Kolkata but around 7.34pm, it lost communications and RADAR contact.\nSP Sumit Kumar, speaking to ANI, said: “We got information around 10pm that an accident has happened… Getting here was difficult considering the terrain… The Delhi team will come here for investigation and try to recover the black box… Total number of deaths is seven.\"\nHeart-wrenching stories have come to the fore from the crash. For instance, the family of Shaw, the patient being transported in the ambulance, had taken a loan of around Rs 8 lakh to hire the aircraft that crashed shortly after taking off.\nShaw had suffered 65 per cent burns last Monday after an electric short circuit at his restaurant in Chandwa triggered a fire. As his condition deteriorated, the family decided to shift him to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in New Delhi for advanced care. As a journey by road was not possible for Shaw, the family had borrowed around Rs 8 lakh from friends and relatives for an air ambulance.\n“Our home has been destroyed. Not just one home, many families have been ruined. If proper treatment had been available in Ranchi itself, we would not have had to take him to Delhi. And in the process of taking him to Delhi, this tragedy happened, our very existence has been shattered,\" Shaw’s relatives said.\nAnother life lost in the crash was of Vikas Kumar Gupta, the doctor on board the aircraft. Speaking to the media, Gupta’s father spoke about the sacrifices he made to educate his son.\n“My elder son was posted in Sadar Hospital, Ranchi. If there had been proper health facilities here, why would they have gone to Delhi for treatment? I had sold my farmland and other things for his education,\" he told ANI.\nThe Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) condoled the incident and launched a probe into the crash. A team from the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) also visited the site to recover the black box and find the exact cause behind the crash.\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "Govt Set To Roll Out Nationwide Free HPV Vaccination For Girls Aged 14-15 Years | Exclusive",
        "content": "The Union government is preparing to roll out a nationwide Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination campaign within a week, aimed at reducing the burden of cervical cancer among young women in India, government sources familiar with the development have told News18.\nThe campaign will provide MSD’s Gardasil 4 HPV vaccine free of cost to eligible beneficiaries through government health facilities across the country. In the private market, the vaccine costs around Rs 4,000 per dose.\nGardasil 4 protects against four HPV strains—6, 11, 16 and 18. “Of these, strains 16 and 18 are considered high-risk and are responsible for nearly 83 per cent of cervical cancer cases in India. Globally, these strains are responsible for over 70 per cent of cases,\" a senior official familiar with the development said, while explaining why the Centre has chosen Gardasil vaccine. “This initiative represents a decisive step towards eliminating cervical cancer, one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among women in the country.\"\nUnder the proposed rollout plan, a single-dose schedule will be followed. “WHO’s SAGE panel as well as India’s top panels on vaccination have approved the single-dose usage of Gardasil considering it to be equally effective to double or multi-dose vaccine.\"\nCervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women in India, with over 78,000 new cases and 42,000 deaths reported in 2024. The campaign will run in campaign mode for 90 days, followed by integration into routine immunisation days.\nWho Is Eligible And Where To Go?\nThe vaccination process will be integrated with the U-WIN digital platform, similar to the CoWIN system used during the Covid-19 vaccination drive. From slot booking to certification, the entire process is likely to be digitised.\nThe campaign will primarily target girls in the 14 to 15 age group. “Those who have just turned 14 will remain eligible until they turn 15. In addition, girls who turn 15 at the time of launch will be allowed a three-month window to receive the vaccine. The vaccine will be available free of cost only within this eligibility bracket,\" the source quoted above said.\n“The campaign will target 14-year-old girls across India, covering an annual cohort of approximately 1.15 crore girls each year. Vaccination will be provided free of cost, voluntary, and administered only with parental consent,\" he said.\nVaccinations will be administered at all government health facilities, including Ayushman Mandirs, government medical colleges, district hospitals, primary and community health centres. Each vaccination team will include a vaccinator, mobiliser, verifier, and volunteer.\nAll sessions will be linked to 24×7 health facilities for AEFI (Adverse Events Following Immunization) management, with helplines available for parental queries. “Health workers across 36 states and Union Territories have been trained for the rollout, with doctors and trained healthcare staff overseeing implementation.\"\nWho Is Supplying The Vaccine & How Safe Is It?\nOn the supply front, Gavi has committed to providing 2.6 crore doses of Gardasil between 2025 and 2027. Of these, around 1.5 crore doses have already reached India. The government officials estimate that India requires approximately 1.15 crore doses annually to cover girls turning 14 each year.\n“Since the introduction of Gardasil in 2006, over 50 crore doses have been administered worldwide, with no serious safety concerns reported except rare cases of anaphylaxis,\" the official quoted above said.\nThe vaccine is non-live, recombinant, and cannot cause HPV infection.\n“HPV vaccines are 93-100 per cent effective in preventing cervical cancer. Global studies, including trials in Kenya and Costa Rica, confirm that a single-dose schedule provides protection comparable to two or three doses, with efficacy sustained for over a decade,\" the official explained.\nHPV Campaign On PM Modi’s Radar\nThe government’s intent to expand access to HPV vaccination had earlier been articulated at the highest level. In an interaction with philanthropist Bill Gates, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said: “In the coming days, I want to talk about cervical cancer, especially for our daughters. I want to give a budget to our scientists in India… and with very little money, I want to vaccinate all the daughters in my country so that they are protected from cancer. I am working in that direction these days.\"\nThe broader policy push was also highlighted by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman during her Interim Budget 2024–25 speech, where she stated, “Our government will encourage vaccination for girls in the age group of 9 to 14 years to prevent cervical cancer.\"\nThe upcoming rollout, if implemented as planned, would mark one of the largest adolescent vaccination drives focused specifically on cancer prevention in the country.\nLatest Blogs",
