In West Bengal, queues in front of local government offices are becoming more frequent.\nWithin days of millions of residents standing in lines for the special intensive revision (SIR), trying to prove themselves as genuine voters, youths in West Bengal started standing in queues again, from Sunday, February 15.\nBy February 17, the line has grown longer. Thousands have assembled at the Banglar Yuba Saathi registration camp at Geetanjali Stadium in the eastern part of Kolkata. Anjali Shaw (25) is sorting out her documents at the registration camp. “It would have been better if we got jobs instead. Considering the condition of the job market there is not much hope, both at the State and national level. But this money is a huge help for now,” she says. Anjali is a graduate and used to work in a private company, but lost her job.\nOn February 5, West Bengal Finance Minister Chandrima Bhattacharya tabled the budget for the year 2026-27 in the State Assembly. The budget, months before the West Bengal Assembly poll, announced the new cash incentive for the unemployed youths of West Bengal, called the Banglar Yuba Sathi.\nA Yuva Saathi registration centre at North Kolkatas Kasi Bose Lane. \n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Shrabana Chatterjee\n“Under this Scheme, those between 21 and 40 years who have passed Madhyamik (class 10), are unemployed, and not covered under any social security scheme of the government, other than educational benefit or scholarship, shall be entitled to monthly assistance of ₹1,500 till they get employment or up to 5 years, whichever is earlier,” the Finance Minister said in the State Assembly amidst cheers by the MLAs of the Treasury Benches.\nOn the very first day the camp was set up, about 2 lakh people filled in the forms, say government sources. By the end of a week the number of youths registering for the scheme is in millions. There are graduates, postgraduates, even those with MBA degrees.\n“My brother does ad hoc work. He does not have any regular income even though he is a graduate,” says Suman Mondal who is helping his brother fill out the Yuva Saathi registration form at Geetanjali Stadium.\nIn the Mondal family, Suman’s wife and mother also get a monthly allowance of ₹1,500 each under the West Bengal Lakshmir Bhandar scheme, which is a direct cash transfer social welfare scheme for women. They hope that the cumulative ₹4,500 will help ease life in their household.\nThe State government has made an additional allocation of ₹5,000 crore in the budget for the scheme. While the scheme was scheduled to be rolled out from August 15, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee directed that camps be set up across the State from mid-February and the first instalment of cash under the scheme be credited in accounts on April 1.\nSome women and men were also accompanied by their parents at the registration centre. “Who likes to stand in line and collect benefits from an unemployment scheme? But that is the reality,” says a father who waits in line at another Yuva Saathi centre on behalf of his son.\nSampa Bhattacharya, a mother of a 20-year-old college student standing in line says, “Everybody in our locality is coming here to stand in lines and get their share in the scheme. I get Lakshmir Bhandar, my daughter does not. So, this is good for her.”\nThe registration camp of Banglar Yuva Saathi in north Kolkata’s Kasi Bose Lane is located at a smaller venue than the Geetanjali stadium, yet the number lining up is disproportionate to the location.\nAlong with the Yuva Sathi Registration desk, the authorities have also set up a Lakshmir Bhandar registration camp. This is a cash incentive scheme for women below 60 years in West Bengal. Announcements are made over loudspeakers asking anyone who has “still not registered with Lakshmir Bhandar” to “easily sign up at the local desk”. Women scurry to get ahead in the line.\nLocal Trinamool Congress MLA and Minister for Industries and Women and Child Development Sashi Panja has been regular at the camp to ensure that people can register for the unemployment allowance without any hassle.\n“A lot of people are saying this is a political move. But we are not forcing anyone to take it or register. It is voluntary. We have seen a huge response till now. Thousands are coming in each day to register,” Panja says.\nLeader of the Opposition in West Bengal Assembly Suvendu Adhikari described the sight of people queuing up for unemployment allowance a “horrendous sight” and said that the Trinamool Congress government was not in favour of creation of jobs.\nThe BJP leader added that the new Banglar Yuba Sathi would face the same fate as the Yuva Shree scheme launched in 2013 to provide allowances and jobs to 17 lakh applicants. Adhikari said that the scheme had effectively been terminated, with no funds allocated since the 2017-18 financial year.\nYuva Sathi is not the first cash incentive scheme started by the Trinamool Congress. Five years ago, before the 2021 Assembly polls Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee announced the Lakshmir Bhandar scheme.\nIn the budget presented on February 5, 2026, Ms. Bhattacharya increased the monthly allowance under the Scheme by ₹500 per month. Now women from the general category will get ₹1,500 per month and from the reserved category ₹1,700 after the increase.\nDescribing the scheme as the brainchild of Chief Minister Banerjee, she said that the scheme will cover 2.42 crore women, which is almost half of the entire population od women in West Bengal. The hike in Lakshmir Bhandar will put a yearly burden of ₹15,000 crore on the State exchequer.\nEconomist Abhirup Sarkar says that economic development has different connotations for different classes of people. “For the poor and the underprivileged, it means two square meals a day, adequate and clean water supply, painless travel on village roads, electricity, free education, easily accessible low-cost health services and, if possible, a house which the family can call its own,” he says. These are seen as development. “If, in addition, there is a cash transfer, however small, there is a feeling of comfort and even empowerment,” says Sarkar, explaining how welfare schemes work.\nDespite the enthusiasm over the new cash incentive scheme, the budget for 2026-27 did not put much emphasis on creation of jobs.\nMs. Bhattacharya, however, did announce a hike of ₹1,000 in the wages of contractual staff. “There are more than 1.25 lakh civic volunteers, village police, and green police workers in the State who are doing a commendable job in helping the Police Administration. To acknowledge their contribution, I am happy to propose an increase in their monthly remuneration by ₹1,000,” she said.\nThis raised concerns about whether the police were going towards an increased contractual force. After the rape and murder of a doctor at Kolkata’s R.G. Kar Hospital and Medical College on August 9, 2024, the accused and later convict was found to be a civic police volunteer who had easy access to the hospital.\nThe Supreme Court had fumed over such recruitment and on October 15, 2024, while hearing the case, had directed the West Bengal government to come clean on the “source of authority” by which civic volunteers like accused Sanjay Roy in the R.G. Kar rape and murder case was employed, especially in sensitive areas such as schools and hospitals.\nA Bench of the then Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud, said employing political acolytes and sympathisers as ‘civic volunteers’ could be a “nice process of conferring political patronage on people who are totally unverified”.\nHowever, these jobs offer some sustenance to people. A civic police volunteer from State’s Jhargram district (who did not want to be named) says that the ₹10,000 salary he earns at the end of each month does not sustain their family. When he started work in 2013, he used to earn ₹2,800.\n“Most civic volunteers in our district have to do something on the side. We have small patches of land to grow vegetables, otherwise we won’t have money to put food on the plate with such a small salary,” he adds. He works 27-28 days a month and gets only 14 days of casual leave in a year. There is no money to save for medical emergencies or to put away for retirement, or his children’s higher education.\nHe is embarrassed that his wife and mother get money from Lakshmir Bhandar to run their household. “We are helpless. I am not proud that we accept free cash from the government. But what else do we have? Back in the day if one member in the family had a government job, the rest of the family lived a regular middle-class life,” he says.\nSanjoy Poria, State president of the West Bengal Civic Police Association (WBCPA) says that in 2013, civic police volunteers had led a movement to demand better work conditions, minimum wages, medical insurance, and recognition as permanent workers. But in 2014 he and many like him faced suspension for allegedly conducting “politically motivated” protests against the State. To this day, Poria still remains under suspension. He now runs his own ambulance service in Paschim Medinipur district’s Keshpur area.\n“We had written to every political party; no one ever came to help us. Once they cracked down on us, the movement fizzled out. Do you see any civic volunteers demanding better work conditions or better pay? The movement has been killed. We were asking for very basic workers’ rights,” Poria adds. Several civic and village police volunteers spoke on the condition of anonymity that with agricultural wages declining to ₹300 a day and sometimes even less, the only option they had was to migrate to metropolitan cities in other States, for work.\nWhile engagement of local civic police volunteers has come in handy for the West Bengal government in managing conflict in areas affected by Left wing extremism, there are often reports of civic police volunteers being used by the ruling political party in local elections and illegal activities like extortion. The involvement of civic police personnel in the death of a student leader, Anish Khan, in February 2022, had also created an outrage.\nBiswanath Chakraborty, professor of political science at Rabindra Bharati University, says that the civic volunteers have provided a political footing to the Trinamool Congress. “There is no proper process for appointment of such personnel. This makes the local Trinamool Congress leadership appoint personnel who will be loyal to them,” Chakraborty says.\n“A civic volunteer has no police authority,” says retired IPS officer Nazrul Islam. He refers to Sanjay Roy, the convict in the R.G. Kar Hospital rape and murder. Roy had a police motorbike and accommodation, which is not part of the emoluments of this cadre.\nGovernment jobs in West Bengal have taken a hit after the school recruitment scam and municipal recruitment scam, which has meant re-examination, hence a postponement of work. At the time people, mostly the youth, were lining up for the cash-for-unemployment scheme, there were protests on the streets of Kolkata demanding permanent jobs.\nPublished - February 23, 2026 04:40 am IST\nSpotlight\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        West Bengal\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Kolkata\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Most of the youth who were falling prey to this menace belonged to the BCs and other downtrodden sections. The government should order a high-level inquiry into it, he demanded.\n“I am placing five main demands before the government. They are the immediate enactment of a BC Protection Act; allocation of 1,000 acres in Amaravati for BCs; a comprehensive caste census; 44% reservation; and adequate budgetary allocations to BC corporations,” he said.\nA host of BC leaders, including Suraj Mandal, the grandson of B.P. Mandal, who chaired the Mandal Commission, took part.\nPublished - February 23, 2026 12:32 am IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Kumaraswamy\nHitting back at Chief Minister Siddaramaiah over his comments on the Janata Dal (Secular) leadership and Vokkaliga politics, Union Minister for Heavy Industries and Steel H.D. Kumaraswamy on Sunday suggested that the time was ripe for him to shower love on Vokkaligas by vacating his post.\n“I welcome the Congress’s generosity to the Vokkaliga community. If the Congress can make a Vokkaliga the Chief Minister, should you also not show the same generosity? Show the generosity by publicly speaking about the agreement you had before becoming the Chief Minister in the second term. Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, K.C. Venugopal, and Randeep Singh Surjewala must have understood your concept of social justice and love for Vokkaligas by now,” he retorted in a statement. “The very political strength and stature you enjoy today were enabled by former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda. Had he chosen to prioritise family or caste, you would not have become Finance Minister, perhaps not even the head of a corporation.”\nStating that the Chief Minister had used names of 13 Vokkaliga leaders for his political selfishness, Mr. Kumaraswamy asked if they did not enjoy power owing to Mr. Gowda’s efforts. “They all enjoyed power due to the sacrifices of Mr. Gowda and grew up before crossing over the fence.”\nHe also accused Mr. Siddaramaiah of backstabbing former Chief Minister S.M. Krishna, snatching the Leader of the Opposition’s post from current Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, and finishing off the chances of another Dalit leader G. Parameshwara.\n“You did not become Chief Minister twice on merit but after sacrificing capable leaders in the name of social justice. Your social justice does not have conscience.”\nThe Union Minister said: “It is embarrassing that the person who trampled upon social justice speaks on it repeatedly. How long will you lie? If you were to be a genuine representative of AHINDA, you would have not dragged your caste at a sensitive time. This is what I had questioned you. My suggestion to you is that do not take the names of Basavanna, Narayana Guru, Kuvempu, and D. Devaraj Urs.”\nPublished - February 23, 2026 12:27 am IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Tharpagaraj.\n                                          | Photo Credit: SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT\nThe State Highways Department has commenced work to lay three new bypass roads at Chengam, Thandrampattu and Kilsirupakkam in Tiruvannamalai district, covering a distance of 8.8 km. The roads will help heavy vehicles and long distance buses skip congested towns on the route.\nMinister for Public Works and Highways E.V. Velu laid the foundation stone for the work in the presence of Collector K. Tharpagaraj, K. Murali, superintending engineer (SE), State Highways, and P. Gnanavelu, divisional engineer (DE), State Highways, a few days ago.\nOfficials of State Highways Department, which is executing the project at ₹90 crore, said the work will be undertaken by the Construction and Maintenance wing of the Department. Three new stretches will act as an alternative route for vehicles to reach key towns like Coimbatore, Salem, Krishnagiri, Dharmapuri, Hosur, Bengaluru, and Vellore without using narrow stretches between Tindivanam and Tiruvannamalai.\nThe stretches will also provide road connectivity to at least 45 surrounding farming villages like Alaputhur, Gengampattu, Nammiyandal, Chennasamudram, Gulalpadi, Kalladavi, and Melpadur. “The new bypass stretches will make existing village roads in Chengam, Arani, Thandrampattu and Tiruvannamalai safer for local motorists. It will decongest these towns from vehicular traffic, which is mainly due to the movement of heavy vehicles. The entire work will be completed by the end of 2026,” S. Ebenezar Anburaj, Assistant Divisional Engineer (ADE), State Highways (Thandrampattu), told The Hindu.\nAt present, vehicles including goods laden lorries and trailer lorries have been passing through the congested Chengam, Thandrampattu, Kilpennathur and Tiruvannamalai towns to  reach surrounding districts like Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri, Salem and Tirupattur. It has not only resulted in traffic congestion but also in accidents, where the majority of the victims are pedestrians.\nFunded under Chief Minister Road Development Plan (CMRDP) 2025-26, the new bypass roads will be a four-lane stretch with at least 19.20 metres wide. Unlike in urban areas, the stretches will have only earthen storm water drains to avoid taking more road space.\nA minor bridge across Alaiyar river, a tributary of Then Pennai river, will be built in Thandarampattu town as part of the new road work. The new bridge will be 30 metres in length and 7.5 metres wide.\nStreet lights, footpaths, reflectors, warning sign boards, pedestrian crossings also form a part of the multi-crore work. Once completed, the new stretches will help goods-laden vehicles, especially from southern districts, to quickly reach areas like Salem, Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri, and Hosur.\nPublished - February 23, 2026 12:12 am IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

P. unit president Palla Srinivasa Rao, BJP MLA Vishnu Kumar Raju and other leaders of the two parties participated in the protest.\nAddressing the protesters, Mr Madhav said the Youth Congress activists tried to disrupt a global event in which over 2.5 lakh observers, 600 start-ups’, 3,250 experts and representatives from 13 countries participated. The protest by the Congress at an event inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is unwarranted and an international event was made a platform for political showdown, he alleged.\nMr. Madhav said that the protest at the Summit, where representatives of 88 companies signed the New Delhi Declaration, has brought immense disrepute to the country. He asked the Congress not to bring disrepute to the country by staging protests at international platforms.\nPublished - February 22, 2026 10:58 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Karunakaran as Chief Minister, but it could not be realised due to political tussles between the LDF and the UDF.\nHe said that on March 5, 2014, he met Mr. Modi after visiting Gujarat.\nMr. Gopi claimed that despite numerous invitations sent through various persons, including the police, to meet Mr. Modi, he did not go. He said he finally met Mr. Modi after certain people to whom he listened approached with the request.\n“When I met him, the first in the charter of demand I placed before him was that if he became the Prime Minister of India, Kerala should be allotted the Vizhinjam project. I said that if the project is given to Kerala, I will be your slave. It is a matter of pride for me to say that I became a slave to a government for the people of Kerala,” he said.\nHe also said that due to his language limitations some of his earlier remarks were misinterpreted.\nHe cited his comment on the appointment of upper-caste members to handle the Tribal Affairs portfolio as an example.\nMr. Gopi said that people from forward communities, such as Brahmins, Naidus, and Raos, should be appointed to work for the upliftment of backward class communities.\n“But similarly, for the welfare of forward-class communities, Ministers from backward classes should also be appointed. It is a broad and reformative perception,” he said.\nHe added that his greatest desire is to work at the Guruvayur temple year-round.\n“My biggest wish is to be the chairman of the Guruvayoor Devaswom Board. I have no desire other than that,” he said.\nPublished - February 22, 2026 09:42 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

File\n                                          | Photo Credit: ANI\nThe Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) has sent a letter to President Droupadi Murmu on Sunday (February 22, 2026), urging her to dismiss Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal from his post for “betraying the nation’s confidence” by entering into a bilateral trade agreement with the United States. The SKM urged her to direct the Prime Minister not to sign the deal on terms which were detrimental to farmers. It also sought a direction from her against a recent demi order of the Union Finance Ministry asking the Kerala government to end bonus to paddy farmers.\nThe SKM alleged in the letter that the Narendra Modi government succumbed to the pressures of the United States and endangered the self-reliance and sovereignty of the country. Maintaining that the terms accepted as per the interim agreement were detrimental to the interests of the Indian economy and India’s farmers, the SKM said the government remained silent about the terms. “In fact, all announcements made by Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal, the chief negotiator, only confirm the worst fears, that the government is either unable to or unwilling to stand up to U.S. diktats. Such acquiescence before an imperial superpower has led to serious resentment among the farming community,” the letter said.\nThe SKM asked when no agreement had been signed as of now, why did U.S. President Donald Trump declare the free trade agreement with India. “Why did Prime Minister Narendra Modi endorse India as a party to the agreement? Why no statement placed in the Parliament that was in session? The Prime Minister has yet to give a satisfactory answer,” the SKM said.\nOn cotton, the SKM said India was self-dependent with double the production of the U.S. “The withdrawal of 11% cotton import duty on August 19, 2025 has sunk domestic cotton prices. Cotton farmers are staring at very serious losses,” it said, adding that Mr. Goyal was insensitive to the issues of cotton farmers. The SKM added that the deal would put over 55 lakh apple farmer families in the country into crisis. Maize would be imported as dry distilled grain (DDG) as per the interim agreement and the import of DDG would deplete the domestic prices and impact 120 lakh corn farmers, the SKM maintained. “Import of ethanol and maize will harm the sugar industry and around 500 lakh sugarcane farmers,” the letter added.\nPublished - February 22, 2026 09:30 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Revanth Reddy to take steps for the revival of the Lakshmipuram lift irrigation scheme and for the construction of a new lift irrigation project on the right bank of the Godavari River.\nDuring the Chief Minister’s visit to the Devadula project in the district on Sunday, the minister submitted a formal memorandum highlighting the urgent irrigation needs of farmers in Kannaigudem mandal and surrounding areas. She noted that the Lakshmipuram lift irrigation system, completed in 2007, has become defunct over the years due to changes in the Godavari’s flow and heavy sand deposition, rendering it unusable.\nMs. Seethakka proposed the revival of the existing system along with a new lift scheme utilising the backwaters of the Sammakka Sagar project (Tupakulagudem) at the head regulator. According to the plan prepared by the department, the two initiatives together would help stabilise irrigation for 921 acres across villages. The estimated cost of the new project is ₹22 crore.\nPublished - February 22, 2026 09:29 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Revanth Reddy with Irrigation Minister Uttam Kumar Reddy and Revenue Minister Ponguleti Srinavasa Reddy reviewing Devadula project in Warangal on Sunday.\nChief Minister A. Revanth Reddy said the Godavari water issue had been given a political colour and asserted that baseless allegations and misinformation would not serve any purpose when the government’s focus was on making North Telangana agriculturally prosperous.\nSpeaking at a review meeting on the Devadula Project, the Chief Minister said that if projects such as Pranahita, SRSP and Devadula had been completed with commitment over the past decade, Telangana could have effectively utilised its 967 TMC water share and even demanded a share in flood waters. There was scope to divert Godavari river waters to the Krishna basin, but except for Kaleshwaram, other Godavari-based projects were ignored.\nHe said Devadula was started in 2001 but remains incomplete even today but the present government was determined to complete it in two years despite severe financial constraints. Funds would be sanctioned soon for Devadula, whose cost had escalated from ₹6,000 crore to ₹18,500 crore.\nHe directed officials to complete repairs to the Devadula Project pumps within a month and also instructed that a special meeting involving MLAs and senior officials be held during the Assembly session to exclusively review Devadula-related issues. He also directed officials to submit a detailed report on a proposed plan to supply water from Ramappa Cheruvu to Jampanna Vagu.\nThe CM assured that all projects on the Godavari from Tummidi Hatti to Bhadrachalam would be completed. He also noted that despite not lifting even a drop of water from the Kaleshwaram Project for two years, Telangana had emerged as number one in paddy production, exposing what he termed as the ‘illusions’ created by the previous government. The CM announced a series of time-bound decisions to expedite irrigation projects, stating that ₹600 crore would be sanctioned for land acquisition before June 2.\nClarifying that his government was not indulging in criticism over why structures like Medigadda, Annaram and Sundilla were built, Mr. Reddy asserted that the Kaleshwaram project would not be allowed to become defunct. “It is not anyone’s private property but public money. We will restore it to use while ensuring there is no future damage,” he said, adding that agencies were studying sub-surface changes to take all necessary precaution.\nDismissing allegations that Telangana was diverting water to neighbouring States, Mr. Revanth Reddy questioned whether any elected representative of Telangana would cooperate against the State’s interests. “Cheap allegations will not help. We have no ego issues and are open to suggestions,” he said.\nIn a lighter vein, he advised former Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao to focus on his health, take up walking and yoga, read good books and listen to spiritual discourses, while urging him not to ‘spread negativity among the people’.\nPublished - February 22, 2026 09:09 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

He also launched a project for the rehabilitation of traders who gave up land for the project. Mr. Vijayan said that the State government has in the last ten years implemented projects worth ₹1.16 lakh funded through Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) for improvement of basic infrastructure.\n“The Vattiyurkavu junction development project will give a fillip to the basic infrastructure development of the entire capital city. The project is a result of the government’s understanding that the allied regions should develop along with the capital city. With this, a long-standing demand of the residents of Vattiyurkavu and beyond will become a reality. Similar developmental projects are ongoing all across Kerala,” he said.\nMr. Vijayan lauded the several traders who readily gave up their livelihood for the development project. He said that the government spent ₹89 crore to acquire 2.31 acre land for the rehabilitation of traders. The Vattiyurkavu area will turn into a prominent commercial hub in the capital once the junction development project is completed, he said.\nVattiyurkavu MLA V.K. Prasanth, who presided over the function, presented the various elements of the rehabilitation project.\nThe Vattiyurkavu junction development project involves the development of the 10.8-km stretch from Sasthamangalam- Vattiyurkavu-Mannarakkonam-Peroorkada and from there to Mukkola and Vazhayila. The road will be developed with a width of 18.5 m. The land acquisition proceedings have already been completed in the first reach from Sasthamangalam to Mannarakkonam and in the second reach from Mannarakkonam to Peroorkada.\nAn amount of ₹415.34 crore was spent on land acquisition for the two stretches, while an amount of ₹28.69 crore will be spent on the renovation of the first reach and an amount of ₹24.50 crore on the renovation of the second reach. The land acquisition proceedings for the third reach from Mannarakkonam to Vazhayila is ongoing, for which ₹212.91 crore is expected to be spent. An amount of ₹13.63 crore has been allocated for shifting the electric, drinking water and sewerage lines in the existing road.\nPublished - February 22, 2026 09:05 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

File.\n                                          | Photo Credit: PTI\nThe India AI Impact Summit “proved to be a turning point in the trajectory of how the world will utilise the power of AI in the future”, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday (February 22, 2026), adding that global leaders were impressed by India’s progress in the domain.\nIn his Mann ki Baat address, Mr. Modi — who met global leaders and tech CEOs and showed them India’s innovations — said leaders from many countries and industries, innovators, and people from the start-up sector came together at the summit.\nEighty-five countries and three international organisations signed the New Delhi Declaration. “Guided by the principle of ‘Sarvajan Hitaya, Sarvajan Sukhaya’ [Welfare for all, Happiness for all], the Declaration underscores that the benefits of AI must be equitably shared across humanity,” the government had said about the declaration.\nMr. Modi said world leaders were impressed by two exhibits at the venue. The first one showed how use of AI helped people in the treatment of animals, and how farmers tracked their livestock with 24x7 assistance.\nThe second product was related to Indian culture and heritage. Mr. Modi said leaders were amazed at how with the help of AI, India is preserving ancient texts, knowledge, manuscripts and adapting them in accordance with today’s generation. “At the India AI Impact Summit, world leaders were impressed by these AI breakthroughs,” he said.\nThe AI summit, which ended in Delhi on Friday (February 20), attracted five lakh footfalls. The Prime Minister said the world saw the country’s amazing capabilities in AI when India launched three homegrown AI models.\nWith technology entering our lives like never before, Mr. Modi urged people to remain vigilant against online financial fraud and digital arrests. He appealed for complete KYC compliance saying it is crucial for the safety of an individual’s bank account.\nHighlighting the significance of organ donation, Mr. Modi noted how 10-month-old Aalin Sherin Abraham from Kerala saved lives even in death. “Even amid such profound pain, Aalin’s father Arun Abraham and mother Sherin decided to donate Aalin’s organs. This single decision reveals the expanse of their thinking and the magnitude of their personality... Aalin is no longer with us, but her name has joined the ranks of the nation’s youngest organ donors,” he said.\n“Like Aalin from Kerala, there are many people who have given a second life to someone through organ donation. For example, Lakshmi Devi from Delhi,” said Mr. Modi. She traveled to Kedarnath last year and trekked 14 km after a heart transplant. Similarly, Gaurang Banerjee from West Bengal has been to Nathu La twice after a lung transplant. Ramdev Singh of Sikar, Rajasthan, underwent a kidney transplant and is now excelling in sporting activities.\nIn the backdrop of the Opposition’s allegations that the India had compromised the interests of farmers during trade negotiations with the U.S., Mr. Modi said farmers were not just food providers, but true “devotees” of the earth. He highlighted how farmers are blending tradition with technology and cited the example of Hirod Patel in Odisha who has installed a mesh over a pond and is growing vegetables on it. He said in Kerala’s Thrissur, 570 varieties of rice are grown in a single field.\n“Today, India has become the world’s largest rice producer... agricultural products are now reaching foreign countries more easily by air. Nanjangud bananas from Karnataka, Mysuru betel leaves, and Indi lemons were exported to the Maldives,” he said.\nThe Prime Minister also addressed students who are appearing for examinations and greeted people on Ramzan and the upcoming Holi festival. He urged them to buy made-in-India products.\nHe spoke about the ongoing T20 World Cup and said many players of Indian origin were representing countries such as Canada, United States, Oman, New Zealand, United Arab Emirates, and Italy. “Wherever Indians go, they remain connected to the roots of their motherland and contribute to the development of their karambhoomi, the country they live and work in,” he said.\nPublished - February 22, 2026 08:40 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

The government’s policy is not to shut down presses but to strengthen them,” the Chief Minister said, pointing out that Kerala has successfully taken over and efficiently run several public sector institutions put up for sale by the Centre.\nDuring the event, he also inaugurated CTP (Computer-to-Plate) machines at the Government Central Press, Thiruvananthapuram, and the Government Press, Mannanthala.\nThe function, held at the collectorate mini conference hall, was presided over by Minister for Forest and Wildlife A.K. Saseendran. He said the new form store was proof that Kasaragod district was moving forward in development. Traditional printing processes that once took days could now be completed within 30 minutes using modern technology, he added.\nN.A. Nellikkunnu, MLA, attended as the chief guest. Copies of the Kerala Service Rules and service books were handed over to collectorate employees, and applications for gazette notification were also received during the function. Senior officials, local body representatives, trade union members, and leaders of service organisations were present.\nThe Kasaragod facility is the 13th form store in the State. The form store handles procedures related to gazette notification for changes in name, signature, religion and caste. It also distributes forms, registers and departmental examination materials to government offices.\nServices that were earlier available only at the Kannur form store will now be accessible in Kasaragod, reducing the need for long-distance travel. The new store will function on the second floor of the C and D Block at the collectorate.\nMeanwhile, the Minister also laid the foundation stone for the new district office building and online examination centre of the Kerala Public Service Commission (PSC) in Kasaragod. He said Kerala was a national model in conducting transparent and efficient recruitment, adding that no other State ensured such transparency in PSC operations.\nM. R. Baiju, chairman, PSC, presided over the function. Rajmohan Unnithan, MP, district panchayat president Sabu Abraham, and other elected representatives and officials attended the ceremony.\nPublished - February 22, 2026 08:37 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

The ED later registered a money-laundering case and arrested several accused, including CPI(M) leaders. The Central agency also named the CPI(M) as an accused, along with K. Radhakrishnan, MP; A.C. Moideen, MLA; and certain district leaders.\nThe Enforcement Directorate has estimated that around ₹180 crore was siphoned off from the bank during the CPI(M) rule.\nPublished - February 22, 2026 08:36 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Trains plying on Palakkad - Coimbatore direction are generally routed through ‘B’ line and ‘A’ line is used for traffic on the opposite direction.\nTwo such underpasses constructed by the Railways on ‘B’ line in 2023 and 2024 are being used by wild elephants to cross the track with safety.\nSources with the Palakkad Division said locations of the proposed additional underpasses will be finalised soon for further procedures.\nA total of 28 incidents of wild elephants getting hit by moving trains while crossing railway tracks, mostly resulting in fatality, were reported between Kottekad in Palakkad district and Ettimadai in Coimbatore district from 2002 to 2024. The last death of an elephant reported on the section was on the Kerala side, when a juvenile tusker was knocked down by a train at Vattappara near Walayar on February 4.\nSources said  the Palakkad Division has erected fences using old rails on both sides of the vulnerable stretches between Walayar and Ettimadai as physical barriers.\nAn elephant intrusion detection system (EIDS) installed by the Division for 35 km between Kottekad and Edttimadai at a cost of ₹20 crore is in the testing state now. The EIDS uses optical fibre–based sensing network with artificial intelligence–driven analytical modules to detect the presence of elephants near railway tracks to generate alerts.\nSpeed restrictions, maximum of 65 kmph during the day and 45 kmph from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., are applicable for trains passing through the forest areas of Madukkarai range. The distance required for a train moving at 110 kmph to come to a halt is around 700 metres. A braking distance of about 250 metres is required for a train moving at 65 kmph and around 180 metres when the train speed is 45 kmph, said the sources.\nPublished - February 22, 2026 08:25 pm IST\nCoimbatore\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        nature and wildlife\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        habitat (conservation)\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Khandre on Sunday said that agriculture can become a profitable sector only when backed by sustained research, assured market access and effective delivery of government schemes on the doorsteps of farmers.\nHe was speaking after inaugurating a Job Mela, Millet Mela, Fruit and Flower Exhibition and Fisheries Fair organised jointly by the district administration, the Zilla Panchayat, the departments of Skill Development, Agriculture, Horticulture and Fisheries at Nehru Stadium in Bidar.\nStating that nearly 75% of the district’s population depends on agriculture due to limited industrial presence, Mr. Khandre stressed the need to strengthen the farm sector.\nHe noted that around 10 lakh acres are cultivated annually in the district, of which 50% is under soybean, 25% under tur (pigeon pea) and the remaining 25% under other crops.\nHe urged farmers to diversify their cropping pattern instead of relying on a single crop and encouraged greater cultivation of millets.\n“Millets are not merely foodgrains; they are the foundation of a healthy life. They require less water, are climate-resilient and ensure stable income for farmers. They protect both agriculture and public health,” he said and appealed to people to incorporate millets into their daily diet.\nHe also called upon farmers to focus on value-added products to improve their income.\nThe Minister said that the primary objective of the mela is to create awareness about government schemes, horticulture produce and market support systems to ensure farmers receive remunerative prices for their crops.\nHighlighting government support during recent adversities, Mr. Khandre said that due to excessive rainfall last year, crops over 1.65 lakh hectares were damaged.\n“The government deposited ₹288 crore directly into the bank accounts of 1.92 lakh farmers as compensation. In addition, about ₹100 crore has already been disbursed under crop insurance, with another ₹50 crore expected shortly. In total, nearly ₹450 crore has been credited directly to farmers accounts in the district,” he said.\nHe also stressed the need to curb excessive chemical use in agriculture and promote sustainable practices. Irrigation projects such as Karanja and Mekar are operational and steps will be taken to fill lakes in Aurad taluk, he added and reiterated the government’s commitment to the welfare of farmers.\nZilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer Girish Dilip Badole said that 32 companies are participating in the Job Mela and urged job-seekers to register in large numbers through the online link made available via NRLM and GPLF networks at the village level.\nThe Minister later visited 49 stalls set up by various government departments and private institutions as part of the fair.\nEarlier, a Siridhanya Nadige (Millet Walk) was flagged off by Bidar South MLA Shailendra Beldale from Chhatrapati Shivaji Circle to Nehru Stadium, with women carrying millets drawing attention.\nMunicipal Administration and Haj Minister Rahim Khan, Karnataka Fisheries Development Corporation Chairperson Mala Narayanrao, KADA Chairman Babu Honnanayak, Deputy Commissioner Shilpa Sharma, Bidar City Corporation Commissioner Mukul Jain and other officials were present.\nPublished - February 22, 2026 08:25 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

The State Budget has earmarked ₹2 crore for setting up the museum. The building that earlier housed the Edakkad block panchayat office will be handed over for the project.\nThe museum aims to create a visual narrative chronicling Kerala’s development across sectors and generations. The allocation was made following a proposal by Minister for Museum, Archaeology and Archives Kadannappally Ramachandran, who represents the constituency.\nOfficials said, at present, Kerala has only one such museum in the private sector. The two-acre earmarked for the project will be transformed into a cultural centre integrated with the museum, catering to students, researchers, tourists, and the public.\nPlans include an open-air amphitheatre, outdoor photo installations, a sculpture gallery, and a large camera obscura-style installation. The museum will also feature touch-screen kiosks, audio guides, a dedicated photography exhibition hall, a photography-focused library, and a shop area.\nThe facility is expected to serve as a platform for emerging photographers to showcase their work. Workshops, seminars, and photo talks will be conducted, covering subjects ranging from basic photography skills to advanced techniques.\nVisitor amenities such as parking facilities, disabled-friendly access and a cafeteria will be provided. Tree saplings will be planted to create a green and aesthetically appealing environment, officials said.\nPublished - February 22, 2026 08:07 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

It ignored the infrastructural needs of the district. But we are working towards equitable development of all regions of the State. I would like to inform you that the Congress government has spent around ₹1.18 lakh crore for the five guarantee schemes. Of this, around ₹2,954 crore have been spent on schemes in Uttara Kannada. At the same time, development works, including infrastructure projects, health and education schemes, livelihood and industrialisation initiatives, have not stopped. They are progressing along with welfare programmes like the guarantee schemes. The criticism can continue, but the people of the State know very well about our development programmes,” the Chief Minister said.\nHe was speaking after inaugurating a multi-speciality hospital built on the premises of Karwar Institute of Medical Sciences (KRIMS) and launching other programmes.\nThe Chief Minister said that Karwar will get a super-speciality hospital in the next Budget. “Work on the super-speciality hospital will start soon and I will inaugurate it. The State government is committed to starting government medical colleges in each district. We have 22 government medical colleges already. In the coming years, we will start such institutions in Kolar, Puttur and Vijayapura. We approved KRIMS in our first term in 2016. We set aside ₹200 crore for a 450-bed hospital for the college. It has been completed now. It will help the people of this district who were earlier forced to travel long distances to Mangaluru, Udupi or Hubballi to get medical treatment,” he said.\nDeputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar said that he is working with legislators and officers to find solutions to the problems of the people in all districts.\n“I strongly believe that serving people is serving God. We will continue to serve the people, irrespective of what others say,” he said.\nThe Chief Minister and the Deputy Chief Minister inaugurated a new bridge on the Khanapur-Talaguppa State Highway in Yellapur taluk and the new building of an Inspection Bungalow in Yellapur town and the government guesthouse in Mundgod.\nMinisters Sharanprakash Patil, Mankal Vaidya, MLAs R.V.

        "content": "Rajasthan Education Minister Madan Dilawar on Sunday claimed that milk from indigenous cows enhances children’s intelligence and energy, while buffalo milk makes them sluggish.\nDilawar made the remarks while addressing a gathering at a programme on ‘Go-Samvardhan and Gocharan’ (cow conservation and grazing) in the Ramganj Mandi constituency of Kota district.\n“A person who drinks the milk of a high-shouldered indigenous cow becomes intelligent, whereas those who drink buffalo milk tend to be sluggish,\" the Rajasthan Education Minister said.\n#WATCH | Kota: Rajasthan minister Madan Dilawar says, “…Choose 5-7 cows that have given birth to calves 3-4 days ago. Similarly, choose buffaloes that have given birth to calves 3-4 days ago. Stand those buffaloes and the mother cow in front of you and release their calves… pic.twitter.com/gsqs4sQoZV— ANI (@ANI) February 22, 2026\n\nTo justify his claims, the minister suggested selecting a few cows and buffalo that had given birth to calves a few days ago and making them stand on opposite sides.\n“Now, release their calves from a distance to go to their mothers,\" he said. He claimed the buffalo calf would struggle to find its mother, unlike a cow’s calf.\n“A buffalo calf will find its mother with great difficulty by running away, but a cow calf will go straight to its mother, which means that a child who drinks cow’s milk is intelligent, while a child who drinks buffalo’s milk is weak in the mind,\" he remarked.\nOffering another example, Dilawar stated, “Give each calf — both the cow and the buffalo — a full feed of milk before letting them return to their mothers. The buffalo calf, after a few steps, would cough and begin to doze off, while the cow calf, with its tail held high, would spring into lively motion, showcasing its playful energy and sharp intelligence.\"\nHe also referred to differences in terminology for calves and concluded, “If you want progress for your children, want to get them forward and make them intelligent and playful, offer them milk of ‘Gou Mata’.\"\nDilawar also announced the revival of a traditional cow-grazing system in 14 villages, under which one village cowherd (Guwala) will be appointed for every 70 cows. If the number exceeds 70, two cowherds will be engaged. Each will receive an honorarium of Rs 10,000 per month, with the arrangement supported by village donors (Bhamashahs), an official said.\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "No 20-Year Cooling-Off Period For Retiring Military Officials: Rajnath Singh After Naravane Book Row",
        "content": "Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday clarified that there is no proposal for a mandatory 20-year cooling-off period for retired army officers writing books. Speaking to reporters, the minister said that no such proposal came up for discussion before the Cabinet. Therefore, there will be no restriction or ban on former Army officials or retiring officials on writing books soon after their retirement.\nThis controversy sparked over a book — “Four Stars of Destiny\" — written by former Army chief General MM Naravane. This book caused a nationwide stir after the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, tried to read excerpts from it in the parliament.\nThe book is on the Ladakh standoff with China.\nThe stunt witnessed massive uproar and it was alleged that the book contained sensitive information regarding national security. The book was set to be released in 2024, but its release was halted as the review by the Defence Ministry was pending.\nDefence Minister further reiterated that rules already exist that retired officers should not disclose classified or secret information. “Government permission is required to publish any sensitive information. So, the government’s position is that there is no need for a new 20-year rule; the current laws are sufficient,\" he said.\nAs per the current regulations, military officials are restricted from revealing classified information related to national security even after their retirement. Such disclosure is subject to regulations under the Official Secrets Act.\nControversy Around Naravane’s Unpublished Book\nAs per the police, the book was leaked on some social media sites and a case has been registered with the Special Cell in order to carry out a thorough investigation into this purported leak or breach.\nCongress leader Rahul Gandhi was seen flashing a purported copy of the book in the Parliament on February 3. After massive uproar, eight MPs were suspended over the issue.\n“Upon verification, it was found that a PDF copy of a type-set book with the same title and apparently prepared by M/s Penguin Random House India Pvt Ltd is available on certain websites and, also, some online marketing platforms have displayed the finished book cover as if it is available for purchase,\" Delhi police said in its official statement.\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "India Shows How AI Can Work At Scale, But Inclusion Remains The Challenge: World Bank | Exclusive",
        "content": "The ‘India AI Impact Summit 2026’ brought together policymakers, industry leaders, multilateral institutions, and technologists at an unprecedented scale, signalling a shift in the global conversation around artificial intelligence.\nMoving beyond hype and model size, the summit focused squarely on how artificial intelligence (AI) can deliver real-world development outcomes, from jobs and productivity to public service delivery, while confronting risks around inequality, exclusion, and trust.\nFor the World Bank Group, the summit was a key moment to advance its vision of AI as a tool for inclusive growth. As governments across the Global South race to embed AI into welfare systems, education, healthcare, and governance, the World Bank has positioned itself at the centre of debates on responsible adoption, digital public infrastructure, cybersecurity, and global safeguards. Its emphasis on “small AI\", practical, affordable systems that work in low-resource settings, reflects a broader push to ensure AI narrows, rather than widens, development gaps.\nCNN-News18 spoke with Paul Procee, acting country director for India at the World Bank, and Mahesh Uttamchandani, regional practice director for digital and AI across East Asia and the Pacific and South Asia. The conversations ranged from the risks of AI-led exclusion and algorithmic bias to India’s role in shaping global AI norms, the governance challenges of deploying AI at the state level, and the uncomfortable truths policymakers still avoid when it comes to AI and inequality.\nExcerpts from the interview:\nThe World Bank increasingly frames AI as a development tool, but many argue it risks widening inequality in low-capacity states. How do you ensure AI projects backed by the World Bank do not end up benefiting governments and vendors more than vulnerable populations?\nMahesh Uttamchandani: At the World Bank Group, our focus is clear – AI must drive inclusion, not deepen divides. That means designing AI that works for people at the margins, not just for governments or tech vendors. We are prioritising what we call “small AI\" solutions that are affordable, practical, and effective even where connectivity and infrastructure are limited.\nIn Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, we are working with governments and partners to assess AI-powered learning tools that help students build job-ready skills. In Uttar Pradesh, AI tools are helping farmers reach wider markets, raise incomes, and create new employment opportunities. These initiatives show that when AI is grounded in local realities, it can deliver immediate gains in health, education, and agriculture, and directly strengthen communities rather than bypass them.\nIndia’s digital public infrastructure is often held up as a global model. As AI gets embedded into welfare delivery, health, and education systems, what specific risks of exclusion or error worry the World Bank most in the Indian context?\nPaul Procee: India has emerged as a global benchmark for digital public infrastructure. Platforms like Aadhaar and unified payments interface (UPI) show how technology can deliver services at scale with speed and transparency. But as AI is embedded into welfare delivery, health, and education, new risks come into focus.\nThe biggest concern is exclusion by design. Algorithmic bias, weak local-language data, or systems trained on non-representative datasets can unintentionally lock out certain communities. There are also serious cybersecurity risks. Attacks on AI-enabled systems could disrupt essential services or expose sensitive personal data, undermining public trust.\nFor the World Bank Group, the priority is to put responsible AI governance and cybersecurity at the core, not as an afterthought. That means strong data governance, transparency around how algorithms are deployed, effective grievance redress mechanisms, and clear lines of accountability.\nIndia has already taken important steps in this direction. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act establishes clear rules on consent, data handling responsibilities, and cross-border data sharing. Building on this emphasis on trust, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, at the AI Impact Summit, called for a “glass box\" approach to AI. The idea is simple but powerful – AI systems should be open, explainable, and governed by visible and verifiable safety rules, not hidden behind opaque black boxes.\nSeveral Indian states are now experimenting with AI in policing, education, and social services. Is the World Bank engaging directly with state governments on AI deployment and, if so, how does it ensure consistency with national and global safeguards?\nPaul Procee: AI governance cannot stop at state or national borders. Data flows freely across jurisdictions, and risks such as cyber threats or misinformation do not respect boundaries. That is why regulation must be rooted in local realities, but anchored in shared global principles.\nThe World Bank Group follows a layered approach. At the state level, AI deployment must comply with national laws. At the same time, it should reflect global best practices on fairness, transparency, accountability, and data privacy.\nStates need room to tailor AI tools to local needs, but within a common safeguards framework. The approach we advocate is risk-based, principles-driven, and aligned with each country’s institutional capacity and level of digital maturity.\nThis philosophy extends globally. For instance, we have supported the development of the African Union AI Continental Strategy, which strikes a balance between regional coordination and national flexibility.\nAI may be borderless, but governance cannot be one-dimensional. It has to operate simultaneously at the local, national, and global levels to ensure innovation moves forward safely, inclusively, and with shared standards of trust.\nIndia increasingly positions itself as a voice for the Global South on technology governance. Does the World Bank see India as a co-architect of global AI norms, or mainly as a test case whose lessons are later exported elsewhere?\nPaul Procee: India is both a co-architect of global AI norms and a proving ground for inclusive AI at scale. Its strength lies in its ability to pilot innovation through regulatory sandboxes and targeted programmes, and then rapidly scale what works. That transition from proof of concept to nationwide impact offers powerful lessons for other developing economies.\nMore importantly, India is helping reframe the global AI conversation. Instead of focusing only on ever larger models or greater computing power, it is pushing the debate toward development outcomes such as jobs created, productivity gains, and better public service delivery. The World Bank Group is partnering with India in this shift by supporting “small AI\": task-specific, multilingual systems that function on low bandwidth and basic smartphones.\nIndia’s leadership also matters at the regional and Global South level. Not every country can build large-scale computing infrastructure on its own, but shared facilities, common standards, and open-source partnerships can expand collective capacity. With its scale, technical talent, and policy ambition, India is shaping how AI governance and digital development evolve across the Global South.\nFinally, after listening to leaders and industry voices at the AI Impact Summit, what is the most promising signal you’ve seen for AI-led development – and what is the most uncomfortable truth about AI and inequality that policymakers still prefer to avoid?\nMahesh Uttamchandani: The most promising signal is the growing recognition that AI can create jobs and expand opportunity when it is designed for inclusion. “Small AI\", practical and affordable tools, is already showing results. We see students receiving personalised learning support, farmers accessing better advisory services, small entrepreneurs building digital credit histories, and clinics extending care to underserved communities. These applications boost productivity and open new pathways to employment for people who are often left behind.\nTo turn this potential into real jobs and opportunity, countries need to learn from one another. That is why the World Bank Group, together with six other multilateral development banks, has launched the AI Repository. It brings together real-world AI applications in development, allowing governments to adapt, replicate, and scale what is proven to work.\nThe uncomfortable truth is that inclusion also increases exposure. As the poorest and most vulnerable are brought into digital systems, risks are unavoidable, from fraud and misinformation to algorithmic bias. Policymakers still tend to treat safeguards as secondary. That is a mistake. Responsible regulation, strong consumer protection, transparency, accountability, and human oversight must be built in from the start. AI can be a powerful force for development, but managing its risks is not optional. It is a shared responsibility.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "The Karnataka government is considering a significant move that could change how young students interact with technology. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has initiated discussions on restricting mobile phone use for children below the age of 16, citing growing concerns over social media addiction and its impact on young minds.\nThe issue was raised during a meeting with vice chancellors of government universities. Seeking their views, the Chief Minister questioned whether such a restriction would be practical and beneficial.\n“Today we are discussing this, and as you are all Vice Chancellors here, I seek your opinion. Children are falling prey to drugs. Also, in line with Australia and some European countries, there is a thought to ban mobile phones among students. I want your opinion on this. We are looking at this for children below 16, not adults. Many of them are falling prey to social media addiction,\" Siddaramaiah said.\nThis comes amid increasing concern about excessive screen time among teenagers. Studies have linked prolonged phone usage to poor concentration, behavioural changes, and mental health challenges.\nAuthorities are now looking for possible ways to implement it across schools and colleges.\nIf approved, Karnataka would join countries like Australia that have introduced measures to curb digital addiction among school students. The proposed restriction would apply only to minors under 16.\nMeanwhile, neighbouring Andhra Pradesh is also reviewing social media regulations. A Group of Ministers led by Nara Lokesh has been formed to examine existing laws and consider stricter controls on children’s online access.\nA final decision in Karnataka is expected after consultations with education experts and stakeholders.\nLatest Blogs",

The court sent the four accused to five days of police custody.\nWhile allowing the Delhi Police’s plea for custodial interrogation, the magistrate said that the alleged actions of the accused “imperil not merely the event’s sanctity but also the Republic’s diplomatic image before foreign stakeholders, rendering it wholly unprotected by constitutional safeguards.\"\nAccording to the court order, as accessed exclusively by CNN-News18, the IYC members orchestrated a premeditated intrusion into the high-security precincts of Bharat Mandapam during the AI Summit 2026.\n“…the accused persons are alleged to have orchestrated a premeditated intrusion into the high-security precincts of Bharat Mandapam during the Al Summit 2026, a premier international conclave hosting global delegates and dignitaries,\" the court’s order said.\nWhile seeking custody of the arrested activists, the Police told the court that the accused donned provocative T-shirts bearing slogans such as “India US Trade Deal Compromised\", raised slogans, obstructed public servants, and allegedly assaulted police personnel, causing injuries substantiated by medico-legal reports.\nThey further said that protests were inspired by Nepal’s violent Gen Z movement that toppled the government there.\n“This is a larger conspiracy that has taken inspiration from the Gen Z protests in Nepal.

        "title": "One Call Home: Indian Govt Plans Global Toll-Free Passport Helpline | Exclusive",
        "content": "The Government of India is preparing to introduce an international toll-free number service that will allow Indian citizens abroad to connect directly with passport support services in India—without paying for the call. There will be no international calling charges and no complicated routing. Just a single number that works.\nFor millions of Indians living, studying, and working abroad, questions about passport renewal, reissue, or urgent grievances can come at stressful moments—a lost passport before a flight, a name correction needed for a visa, or a delay that threatens a job opportunity. In those moments, what matters most is simple access to help.\nThe Ministry of External Affairs is now working to make that access easier than ever. CNN-News18 has accessed a document that has details of the proposal.\nThe proposed international toll-free number service is designed to bridge physical distance with seamless communication. Citizens calling from outside India will dial a dedicated toll-free number from their respective countries.\nThat call will automatically land at the existing Passport Seva Programme Contact Centres located in India. The experience will feel local to the caller, even if the support team is thousands of miles away. The objective is inclusivity—ensuring that even citizens in countries without an Indian embassy or consulate can still reach help.\nFor a student in Europe who has misplaced her passport or a worker in West Asia needing urgent clarification, the process will be straightforward. Dial the toll-free number. Speak to a trained representative. Receive guidance. Raise a grievance if required. All without worrying about international call charges.\nUnder the proposed framework, the selected telecommunications service provider will provision international toll-free number access across multiple countries worldwide.\nWhere feasible, a single international number will cover as many countries as possible. In locations where regulations or telecom limitations prevent the use of the same number, alternate toll-free numbers will be arranged.\nThe calls will originate from multiple countries and terminate within India at the Passport Seva Contact Centres. The entire cost of the calls will be borne by the Ministry of External Affairs. Under no circumstances will any charge be passed on to the caller. That commitment is central to the design of the service.\nBehind the scenes, the system will be built for reliability and scale. The service provider will be required to ensure round-the-clock availability—24 hours a day, seven days a week, all year long. Passport emergencies do not follow office hours, and neither will this helpline.\nThe connectivity will be SIP-based, beginning with a minimum capacity of 40 concurrent calls, with the ability to scale up as demand grows. Redundancy mechanisms, disaster recovery systems, and failover processes will be built in to prevent service interruptions. Real-time monitoring dashboards and detailed Call Detail Records will enable oversight and performance tracking.\nCompliance will also be critical. The service must adhere to all applicable telecom regulations in India, including guidelines issued by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India and the Department of Telecommunications, as well as regulations in the originating countries. The system must be secure, legally compliant, and operationally robust.\nTo identify the right partner, the ministry has issued a Request for Proposal inviting sealed bids from eligible telecommunications operators. The selected bidder will enter into a formal agreement with the ministry, governed by a master service agreement that outlines technical standards, service level commitments, and operational expectations.\nAt its core, this initiative is about something simple yet powerful—reassurance.\nFor Indians abroad, navigating bureaucratic systems across time zones can feel overwhelming. While embassies and consulates continue to provide vital on-ground support, many routine queries can be resolved through a responsive contact centre.\nThe international toll-free number will ensure that geography is no longer a barrier to that connection.\nThis also reflects the evolution of governance in India. The Passport Seva Programme has already digitised applications, appointments, and tracking systems. Adding a global toll-free helpline extends that digital backbone into the realm of voice support, blending technology with human interaction.\nFor the ministry, this is not merely a telecom procurement exercise. It is a step toward strengthening trust with the Indian diaspora. It signals that whether a citizen is in Delhi, Dubai, Durban, or Dublin, help is only a phone call away—and that call will not cost them anything.\nA passport may be issued in India, but its importance travels the world. With this initiative, so will access to support.\nThis move is part of India’s broader journey into digital governance. Over the past decade, the government has steadily expanded e-governance initiatives under the National e-Governance Plan. Several high-impact services were identified as mission-mode projects, and passport reform became one of the most significant among them. The goal was clear: make passport services faster, more transparent, and more citizen-friendly.\nOver the years, this structure has transformed passport delivery within India. Now the focus is expanding outward—towards Indians living overseas.\nThe Passport Seva Project was launched in June 2012 to modernise the way passports are processed and delivered. Today, passport services are managed through an extensive network that includes 37 Passport Offices, 92 Passport Seva Kendras, 452 Post Office Passport Seva Kendras, and more than 200 Indian Missions and Posts abroad.\nThe system operates in a public-private partnership model with Tata Consultancy Services, while the sovereign functions—verification, granting, and issuance of passports—remain firmly with the Ministry of External Affairs. The ownership of data and strategic control also stays with the government.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday laid the foundation stone of the HCL-Foxconn semiconductor facility in Uttar Pradesh, calling it a key milestone for the nation’s self-reliance in semiconductor chips.\n“We are proud that Uttar Pradesh is becoming a part of the semiconductor ecosystem in the country. This semiconductor unit will give new recognition to the state. Moreover, it will boost employment, as the establishment of a semiconductor facility attracts ancillary industries, which will ultimately generate more jobs,\" Modi said in a virtual address.\nTaiwan’s Foxconn and India’s HCL Group formed a joint venture, called India Chip Private Limited, to set up an Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly & Test (OSAT) facility at YEIDA (Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority) in Greater Noida. The advanced facility is expected to be operational by 2028.\nIn his address, PM Modi said a weak supply chain of tiny chips during the Covid-19 pandemic halted development of several economies and stopped work at various factories. “Developed India will be built only when India is self-reliant. For this, Made in India chip is very important. Whatever India is doing in the field of technology in this decade, it will become foundation of our capability in the 21st century,\" Modi said.\nThe establishment of the HCL-Foxconn semiconductor facility in Uttar Pradesh is a step towards technological self-reliance. It will boost India’s presence in the global chip ecosystem.https://t.co/DNY4D9MDUz— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) February 21, 2026\nThe Prime Minister also said four semiconductor units, out of the ten approved under the India Semiconductor Mission, are set to begin production in the country. “If India’s chips are made in India, we will not have to rely on others for the tech manufacturing needs. Digital India, semiconductor chips, EVs, 5G, and AI are the soul of everyday needs. If we have chips of our own, our progress in every sector will remain unimpeded,\" he said.\nHCL Group has earmarked an investment of Rs 3,700 crore over the next few years in the facility that will produce display driver chips. The investment is expected to create over 3,500 direct and indirect jobs, build local supply chains, and attract ecosystem partners across the semiconductor value chain.\nUP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Union IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw were also present on the occasion. They were joined by Roshni Nadar Malhotra, chairperson, HCL Group, and Bob Chen, president (semiconductor business group), Hon Hai Technology Group (Foxconn).\n“In the last 11 years, the Prime Minister has established India as a powerhouse of electronics manufacturing. India is now ranked third among nations that export electronics. In a month, 3.6 crore chips will be produced from this plant. The brain of the digital screens that you see will now be made in Jewar,\" Union Electronics and IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said.\nHCL Group Chairperson Roshni Nadar said the joint venture facility will cater to the requirements of both domestic and international markets. Bob Chen also addressed the event, saying, “We want to establish reliable semiconductor assembly and testing facility in India. We look forward to growing together and contributing to India’s growth in global technology landscape.\"\n(with inputs from PTI)\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "'Studying Developments': Centre's First Response After US Top Court Strikes Down Trump's Tariffs",
        "content": "In its first response to the US Supreme Court’s verdict to strike down the reciprocal tariffs imposed by Donald Trump, the Central government of India said it is studying all developments, from the court’s judgment to Trump’s following remarks, to analyse their implications.\n“We have noted the US Supreme Court judgement on tariffs yesterday. President Trump has also addressed a press conference in that regard. Some steps have been announced by the US Administration. We are studying all these developments for their implications,\" the Ministry of Commerce wrote in an official statement.\nThis came after the US Supreme Court dealt a major blow to the Trump administration by ruling that it did not have the legal authority to impose sweeping global tariffs under emergency powers. Earlier today, Union Minister Prahlad Joshi on Saturday said the Centre will examine the ruling and either the Commerce Ministry or the Ministry of External Affairs will officially react to it.\nIn a 6–3 decision, the court said the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not give a president the power to introduce broad, across-the-board tariffs on imports. The judgment could open the door to refund claims potentially worth tens of billions of dollars.\nUS-India Trade Deal\nWithin hours of the ruling, Trump appeared before reporters and announced a new round of tariffs, signalling that his trade agenda would move forward despite the setback. The president declared a fresh 10 per cent global tariff to be added on top of existing duties.\nTrump also said the existing trade framework with India will continue unchanged. Responding to a question about whether the trade deal or framework with India would still stand, Trump said, “Nothing changes. They will be paying tariffs. And we will not be paying tariffs. This is a reversal for what it used to be.\"\nReferring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Trump said, “India, Prime Minister Modi is a great man, but he was much smarter than the people he was against in terms of the United States. He was ripping us off.\"\nThis came after an interim trade deal between India and the US was announced this month, which reduced US tariffs on Indian imports from 50% to 18% in exchange for Delhi’s promise to stop buying Russian oil.\nHowever, after the Supreme Court verdict, a White House official said that Trump’s sweeping new 10% global tariff will reset rates for all major trading partners, including India. “This is, however, only temporary as the administration will be pursuing other legal authorities to implement more appropriate or pre-negotiated tariff rates,\" the official told AFP.\nA three-day meeting between Indian and American officials to finalise the legal text for an interim trade agreement will begin in the US on February 23, an official told PTI. The Indian team will be headed by chief negotiator Darpan Jain, who is a joint secretary in the Commerce Ministry.\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "Global South Can’t Just Consume AI, We Must Build It Ourselves: Brazil Tech Minister | Exclusive",
        "content": "Against this backdrop, CNN-News18 spoke with Luciana Santos, Brazil’s Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, who explained why Brazil sees India not just as a partner, but as a co-shaper of a more inclusive AI order, one where innovation is guided by public interest, democratic governance, and the realities of the Global South, rather than dominated by a few powerful players.\n\nA post shared by Luciana Santos (@lucianasantos)\nEdited Excerpts:\nBrazil often speaks of AI as a tool for social inclusion, yet large parts of the Global South remain data-poor and compute-poor. How does Brazil realistically prevent AI from deepening inequality rather than reducing it?\nThe risk that artificial intelligence could deepen inequality is real, especially when much of the Global South still faces structural gaps in data availability, computing infrastructure, and skilled human capital. Brazil’s response is to treat AI not just as a technology push, but as a national development project rooted in social inclusion and digital sovereignty.\nThat approach underpins Brazil’s AI Plan 2024-2028, backed by $23 billion reais (about $4.4 billion) in public investment, with nearly 30 per cent already deployed. The focus is on tackling, at scale, the structural drivers of inequality.\nFrom building cutting-edge, renewable-powered supercomputing infrastructure to developing Portuguese-language AI models trained on Brazil’s own diverse data, the aim is to reduce external dependence and avoid imported biases.\nEqually central is large-scale training and reskilling, alongside the strategic use of AI in public services to improve delivery, especially in social sectors.\nBrazil believes that inclusion will not come automatically from innovation. It must be designed through public investment, local capacity-building, and democratic governance, so that the gains from AI are shared broadly, not concentrated in a few regions.\nIndia is positioning itself as an AI bridge between the West and the Global South. Does Brazil see India as a genuine partner in shaping alternative AI models, or is the Global South still largely reacting to rules set elsewhere?\nBrazil clearly sees India as a strategic partner. As major democracies of the Global South facing similar structural challenges, both countries share a responsibility to steer scientific and technological progress toward the public good.\nRather than simply adapting to rules set elsewhere, Brazil and India are well placed to shape their own agenda, grounded in democracy, sustainable development, and social inclusion.\nThis is already taking shape through partnerships between Brazilian and Indian AI centres, including a pilot project on secure, privacy-preserving cross-border data collaboration for medical AI. Using India’s Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture, AI models can be trained without raw data ever leaving the sovereign control of data providers.\nStronger cooperation also boosts our collective voice in global AI governance debates, pushing for frameworks that reflect the realities of the Global South, not just the priorities of major tech powers.\nThat is why summits like this one on AI’s global impact matter. They generate political momentum to democratise access to AI and accelerate its development across the Global South.\nSo, the Global South need not be reactive. Deeper strategic cooperation strengthens our ability to propose, negotiate, and build a more balanced and inclusive international AI governance.\nBrazil has taken a tougher regulatory stance on Big Tech than many emerging economies. Do you worry that stricter AI regulation could slow innovation, or do you believe unchecked innovation is the bigger risk right now?\nWe start from a simple premise: the real question is not whether to regulate or innovate, but how to regulate in a way that enables sustainable and trustworthy innovation.\nAs AI becomes more widespread, the need for strong governance has grown. Clear rules are essential to guide the development, deployment, and use of AI in a safe, ethical, and transparent manner, so its benefits truly serve society. Without them, risks such as algorithmic discrimination or violations of fundamental rights can erode public trust and, over time, undermine innovation itself.\nBrazil has therefore sought a balanced approach. Its AI Bill, approved by the Senate in December 2024 and now before the Chamber of Deputies, adopts a risk-based framework that prioritises users’ rights and participatory governance. Stricter obligations are focused on high-risk systems, while lower-risk applications are spared unnecessary burdens, preserving space for experimentation and new entrants.\nTo reinforce this framework, a complementary bill sent in December 2025 proposes the creation of a National System for the Development, Regulation, and Governance of AI, along with a Brazilian AI Council. By bringing together the National Data Protection Authority and key regulators, the model aims to deliver coordination, predictability, and regulatory clarity, all essential for investment and innovation.\nMuch of Brazil’s AI ecosystem still relies on foreign cloud infrastructure and imported chips. Can Brazil claim AI sovereignty without control over critical compute and semiconductors, and what lessons does it draw from India’s struggles on chip manufacturing?\nAcross the world, countries are increasingly debating what digital sovereignty means in their own national contexts. One widely shared view defines it as the ability to understand how digital technologies work, to develop them, and to regulate them effectively.\nFrom this perspective, sovereignty is not built through isolation, but through stronger technological autonomy achieved via openness, cooperation, and domestic capacity-building. In this context, India emerges as a strategic partner for Brazil, expanding opportunities for technology exchange, joint innovation, and solutions aligned with national priorities, especially in semiconductors, artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, the Internet of Things, blockchain, and advanced communications such as 5G and 6G.\nBrazil is also taking a strategic approach to strengthening its semiconductor ecosystem, focusing on scientific development, skills training, and deeper integration into global value chains through robust workforce programmes and incentives to expand the semiconductor supply chain.\nAt the same time, under Brazil’s AI Plan, the country is building a national public-sector data infrastructure, including sovereign cloud systems developed through partnerships between public data companies and multiple cloud providers. These arrangements are designed to ensure digital sovereignty, transparency, control, trust, and cybersecurity.\nAs BRICS expands its focus on technology cooperation, do you see scope for a BRICS-led AI framework that challenges Western-dominated governance models, or are internal differences too wide to bridge?\nBrazil is an active participant in several multilateral forums on AI governance, consistently stressing the need to promote AI for the benefit of all people, nations, living beings, and the planet. This approach is multi-stakeholder by design, bringing together governments, the private sector, academia, and civil society.\nWithin BRICS, member countries have advanced this vision through debates and conferences aimed at building consensus while respecting each country’s diversity and specific national realities.\nDuring Brazil’s BRICS presidency, the bloc discussed and adopted a declaration on AI governance and principles for the use of artificial intelligence, clearly outlining areas of shared interest. Brazil’s leadership marked an important step toward consensus-building and laid the groundwork for deeper discussions within BRICS going forward.\nFinally, from your perspective at the summit, what has been the most encouraging moment you’ve witnessed here—and what is the most uncomfortable truth about the Global South’s AI ambitions that leaders are still reluctant to admit?\nI find it encouraging to see the Global South leading a complex process such as an AI summit and agenda. This is not only possible, it is necessary. Yet we still remain heavily dependent on platforms, models, and infrastructure controlled by a handful of countries and companies.\nWithout strategic cooperation, long-term investment, and collective negotiation, there is a real risk of reproducing in AI the same technological inequalities of the past. When a few actors control algorithms and digital infrastructure, this is no longer innovation, it is domination.\nDeveloping countries cannot remain mere consumers of technology. They must build their own capabilities through technology transfer, talent development, and sovereign infrastructure.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "In a significant diplomatic development, Bangladesh has fully resumed all visa and consular services at its missions in India, ending a nearly two-month suspension that had marked a low point in bilateral ties.\nThe resumption, effective February 20, applies to all categories, including tourist, medical, business, work and other visas, at Bangladesh’s missions in New Delhi, Agartala and Siliguri. All services had previously been restricted or suspended amid a diplomatic standoff.\nThe move comes just three days after Tarique Rahman was sworn in as prime minister of Bangladesh on February 17, following his party’s decisive electoral victory. Government sources described the decision as one of the new administration’s first major foreign policy steps aimed at stabilising relations with India.\nEnd Of A Two-Month Standoff\nVisa operations had been partially suspended since December 2025 during the interim administration led by Muhammad Yunus, as ties between the two neighbours grew strained. The freeze affected travel for thousands of people, including patients seeking medical treatment, students, businesspersons and families with cross-border ties.\nDiplomatic observers had described the suspension as one of the most visible signs of deteriorating relations between New Delhi and Dhaka in recent years.\nWith the full restoration of services, Bangladeshi missions in India have resumed processing all pending and fresh applications across categories.\nA Deliberate Diplomatic Signal\nTop government sources indicated that the move is being viewed as a deliberate outreach from the new BNP-led government under Rahman to reset ties with New Delhi after the uncertainty of the interim phase.\n“This is among the first tangible foreign policy decisions of the new government,\" a senior official said, adding that normalising mobility and people-to-people contact was a priority.\nThe development also follows reciprocal signals from India. A senior consular representative confirmed that New Delhi is taking steps to fully restore visa services for Bangladeshi nationals in Bangladesh as well.\nPolitical Shift and What’s Next\nRahman’s swearing-in marks a major political shift in Bangladesh, ending the interim period and ushering in a government with a strong parliamentary majority. Analysts say early diplomatic gestures such as restoring visa services are aimed at reassuring regional partners of policy continuity and stability.\nIndia, for its part, is understood to be keen on rebuilding momentum in the relationship. Officials are awaiting Rahman’s response to an invitation from Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a visit to India—a potential next step in recalibrating bilateral engagement.\nFor now, the reopening of visa services is being seen as a practical and symbolic reset, signalling that after weeks of uncertainty, the two neighbours may be moving toward a more stable phase in their relationship.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "When visitors walked into Hall 6 at Bharat Mandapam during the AI Impact Summit 2026 in New Delhi, one pavilion stood out for its sheer size. Galgotias University, a private institution based in Noida, had a 155-square-metre booth, quite larger than the combined space allotted to several Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs).\nThe development drew attention online, especially after the university was embroiled in the robodog controversy at the same event.\nWhat Happened With The Robodog\nGalgotias University faced backlash after a robotic dog displayed at its stall was presented as an in-house innovation developed by its Centre of Excellence. The robot was later identified as the Unitree Go2, a commercially available quadruped developed by China-based Unitree Robotics.\nThe product is sold globally and is not an original invention. The claim triggered criticism and raised concerns about due diligence at a government-backed event. Following the controversy, the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) reportedly asked the university to vacate its stall.\nThe Booth Size In Limelight\nAfter the robodog episode, attention turned to pavilion sizes at the summit. According to a floor plan obtained by The Indian Express from organisers, Galgotias University was allotted 155 square metres in Hall 6.\nIn comparison, four IITs and one research foundation together received 130 square metres. The breakup was as follows:\nIIT Bombay – 35 sqm\nIIT Madras – 35 sqm\nIIT Kharagpur – 24 sqm\nIIT Gandhinagar – 18 sqm\nAirawat Research Foundation at IIT Kanpur – 18 sqm\nCollectively, these institutions, though widely regarded as India’s best engineering and research bodies, had less exhibition space than Galgotias alone. The comparison fuelled online debate over how space was allocated at a summit positioned as a showcase of India’s AI ecosystem.\nHere’s What Social Media Said\nJoining in the debate, a user posted on X, “IITs may have thought that their degree and research is enough, but the Galgotia people understood ‘first-come-first-served’ as ‘come first, take all possession’.

Allocation was handled by the Software Technology Parks of India (STPI), an autonomous body under the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY).\nAccording to an organiser cited by The Indian Express, kiosk space was allotted based on demand. Institutions that applied earlier and requested larger areas could secure more space. There was no formal vetting process tied to research output, institutional ranking or contribution to India’s AI ecosystem.\nHow Much Did Galgotias Pay\nThe rate for academic institutions was fixed at Rs 9,000 per square metre.\nWith 155 square metres allotted, Galgotias University paid approximately ₹14 lakh (excluding taxes and electricity connection charges). Institutions with smaller booths paid proportionately less, based on the space they secured.\nSince the pricing was uniform per square metre, the difference in booth size directly translated into a higher payment.\nWhy The Issue Gained Attention\nThe AI Impact Summit was positioned as a platform to showcase India’s innovation capabilities. The presence of IITs and established research bodies was seen as central to that objective, given their long-standing contributions to AI research and technological development. Viewers questioned whether exhibition space at such events should reflect institutional credibility and contribution instead of demand and booking order.\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "Bundelkhand ‘Epstein’ & Wife Lure 33 Boys With Games & Cash, Film Abuse, Sell To 47 Nations — Banda’s 3rd Death Penalty",
        "content": "In Uttar Pradesh’s Bundelkhand, the Special POCSO Court in Banda has delivered the harshest punishment under the law to a suspended junior engineer of the irrigation department and his wife. They have been sentenced to death after being found guilty of sexually\nexploiting 33 minor boys and selling their abuse videos on the dark web to buyers across the world.\nThe verdict has shocked many not only because of the disturbing scale of the crime but also because it marks the third death sentence awarded by the same court in just six months.\nWho Is The Judge Who Delivered Three Death Sentences In Six Months?\nThe latest verdict was pronounced by Special POCSO Judge Pradeep Kumar Mishra. With this judgment, he has now awarded the death penalty three times within half a year, Dainik Bhaskar reported.\nIn September 2025, in a village under Chilla police station, a minor girl was raped and murdered. The court completed the trial within 58 days after the charge sheet was filed and sentenced the accused to death.\nIn January, in a case from Kalinjar, another accused in a child rape case was also awarded capital punishment.\nLast year, a rape convict was sentenced to death in Marka. In the Chhota Purwa massacre case where two children were killed, the accused was also given the death penalty.\nSo far, five death sentences have been pronounced in Banda district, the report mentioned. But in older cases, the convicts’ families have filed appeals in the High Court and those matters are currently under consideration.\nWhat Is The Latest Case Of The Junior Engineer And His Wife?\nOn Friday, the POCSO court ordered that Ram Bhavan, a junior engineer posted in Chitrakoot, and his wife Durgawati be “hanged till death.\" The couple had been convicted on February 18 after a detailed trial based on digital evidence, medical reports and testimonies\nfrom dozens of witnesses.\nThe court observed that the crime fell within the “rarest of rare\" category due to its brutality, long duration, systematic planning and international ramifications.\nHow Did The Case Begin?\nThe case began in October 2020 when the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) received inputs from INTERPOL about child sexual abuse material linked to an Indian phone number. Acting on this information, the CBI registered an FIR on October 31, 2020.\nRam Bhavan was arrested on November 17, 2020. His wife Durgawati was also taken into custody after investigators found evidence of her involvement.\nThe couple reportedly targeted children from economically weaker families in Banda, Chitrakoot and nearby districts. They lured minors aged between 5 and 16 years by offering gifts and inducements. Once the children were brought home, they were sexually assaulted.\nThe acts were recorded using a laptop camera and mobile phones.\nThe videos and photographs were later uploaded and sold on the dark web to international buyers.\nWhat Did The Digital Investigation Reveal?\nThe CBI recovered a pen drive that contained 34 videos and 679 photographs of minors. After digital forensic analysis, it was found that the material was directly linked to the accused.\nIt was also found that the content was shared with buyers in 47 countries such as China, US, Brazil and Afghanistan.\nThe charge sheet ran into nearly 700 pages and was filed 88 days after the arrests. It included medical examination reports, victim statements, witness testimonies and digital evidence tracing the online distribution network.\n74 witnesses were examined during the trial which included child victims, doctors from AIIMS Delhi, teachers and other witnesses.\nWhat Role Did The Wife Play In The Crime?\nThe court held Durgawati equally responsible. Evidence showed that she actively participated in the exploitation and helped lure children by offering expensive gifts and bringing them into the house.\nThe prosecution also stated that she attempted to influence witnesses and facilitate compromise during the investigation.\nThe court noted that the involvement of both adults in the household deepened the psychological trauma suffered by the children and showed a calculated and sustained pattern of abuse.\nHow Were Children Trapped For Years Without Suspicion?\nRam Bhavan kept a separate mobile phone at home specifically for children. Despite having no children of his own, he used this device to attract neighbourhood minors. Some children admitted that they had visited his house to watch YouTube videos, Navbharat\nTimes reported.\nHe managed to hide his crimes for years due to his polite and simple behaviour. At the time of his arrest, then Chitrakoot SP Ankit Mittal stated that no prior complaint of such nature had ever been received.\nOriginally from Devinka Purwa in Kharaunch village, Ram Bhavan lived in rented houses in Karvi. His brothers resided in the Naraini Atarra Road area. Colleagues described him as soft-spoken and courteous which made it difficult to suspect him.\nHe never applied for government accommodation and instead lived in rented houses. In Sikri village, he rented a house from Kakkoo Singh but had to vacate it within one and a half months after neighbours complained about suspicious activities.\nAt the time of arrest, he was associated with the Arjun Sahayak Project in Mahoba and the Rasin Dam project in Chitrakoot. He was living in a rented house behind the SDM office.\nWhat Did The Court Say About The Impact On Victims?\nWhile delivering the sentence, Judge Pradeep Kumar Mishra described the acts as extremely heinous and said they struck at the foundation of societal morality and child safety.\nDuring the trial, doctors from AIIMS Delhi testified that several children suffered severe physical and psychological trauma. Some had injuries to delicate body parts and required medical treatment in Delhi. The brutality disturbed even the medical team.\nThe court observed that because of the torture, many children’s lives had turned into a living nightmare.\nRecognising the long-term trauma, the court directed the District Magistrate to ensure that each identified victim receives Rs 10 lakh as compensation for rehabilitation and medical support.\nHow Does This Case Echo The Scandal Surrounding Jeffrey Epstein?\nNavbharat Times also compared the case with American financier Jeffrey Epstein who was later exposed as a convicted sex offender running a large child sex trafficking network for years.\nHe was first arrested on July 27, 2006, in Florida in a case related to soliciting a minor for prostitution. Years later, on July 6, 2019, he was taken into custody again, this time facing federal charges of sex trafficking that involved underage girls.\nEven after his death, the controversy surrounding him has not faded. He was found dead in his Manhattan jail cell on August 10, 2019, in what authorities ruled a suicide while he was awaiting trial. The subsequent release of a vast collection of official records,\nwidely referred to as the “Epstein Files,\" has kept him at the center of international legal and political debate.\nLatest Blogs",

The answer emerged in a Banda courtroom on Friday, where a POCSO court, in one of the most disturbing child sexual abuse case, awarded the death penalty to Ram Bhavan and his wife Durgawati for sexually exploiting minors and selling their videos on the dark web to international buyers.\nThe convicts — Rambhavan, a junior engineer in the irrigation department posted in Chitrakoot, and his wife Durgavati — were ordered to be “hanged till death\" by Special POCSO Judge Pradeep Kumar Mishra.\nThe court observed that the crime fell within the “rarest of rare\" category due to its brutality, premeditation, and international ramifications.\nThe couple had been convicted on February 18 following a lengthy trial based on digital evidence, medical reports, and testimonies of multiple victims.\nALSO READ: POCSO Victims Nearly Double In 7 Years As Sexual Offences Against Kids Rise Faster Than Overall Crime\nHow The Case Began\nThe case dates back to October 2020, when the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) received inputs from INTERPOL regarding the circulation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) linked to an Indian phone number. Acting on this intelligence, the CBI registered an FIR on October 31, 2020.\nOn November 17, 2020, Rambhavan was arrested. His wife Durgavati was also taken into custody after investigators found evidence of her involvement. According to the prosecution, the couple targeted children from economically weaker backgrounds in Banda, Chitrakoot, and surrounding districts.\nThey allegedly lured minors aged between 5 and 16 years with inducements and gifts. The court was told that the children were sexually assaulted and the acts were recorded using a laptop camera and mobile devices. These videos and photographs were then uploaded and distributed through the dark web to international networks.\nDigital Trail And Evidence\nDuring the investigation, the CBI recovered a pen drive containing 34 videos and 679 photographs of minors. Digital forensic analysis linked the content directly to the accused. Investigators also found that the material had been shared with buyers in 47 countries, including China, the United States, Brazil, and Afghanistan.\nThe charge sheet, running into nearly 700 pages, was filed 88 days after the arrests. It included medical examination reports of the victims, statements from children and witnesses, and digital evidence establishing the online distribution network.\nIn total, 74 witnesses were examined during the trial. The CBI recorded statements from individuals aged between 4 and 42 years to build a comprehensive case.\nAdvocate Kamal Singh, associated with the POCSO court proceedings, said the case was initiated after international intelligence inputs flagged suspicious online activity.\n“The investigation revealed a systematic pattern of abuse and online dissemination. The digital evidence was crucial in securing the conviction,\" he said.\nALSO READ: ‘Survivors Of Child Abuse Not To Be Re-Traumatised’: SC Rejects Convict’s Plea In POCSO Case\nRole Of Wife And Attempt To Influence Witnesses\nWhile Rambhavan was found directly involved in the sexual assaults and recording of videos, Durgavati was also held equally responsible. The court noted that she not only participated in the exploitation but also attempted to pressure witnesses and facilitate compromise efforts during the investigation.\nThe prosecution said that the involvement of both parents-like figures in such crimes deepened the psychological trauma of the victims and demonstrated a calculated and sustained pattern of abuse.\nCourt’s Observations\nPronouncing the sentence, Judge Pradeep Kumar Mishra said the offence was extremely heinous and had a far-reaching impact on society.\n“The acts committed by the accused are of such a grave nature that they strike at the very foundation of societal morality and the safety of children. This court finds it appropriate to award the maximum punishment,\" the judge observed.\nThe court further directed the District Magistrate to ensure that each identified victim receives Rs 10 lakh as compensation for rehabilitation and medical support. Some of the affected children reportedly underwent treatment at AIIMS, New Delhi, for physical and psychological trauma.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "In continuation of the probe into allegations of ghee adulteration in the making of the sacred Tirupati Laddoos, which the ruling Telugu Desam Party-led NDA government has levelled against the previous YSRCP regime, the Andhra Pradesh government has now set up a one-man committee to examine the findings of the Special Investigation Team (SIT).\nRetired IAS officer Dinesh Kumar has been appointed to study the SIT’s self-contained note and recommend action, if required, against Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) officials and committee members.\nAccording to the government order, Kumar has been tasked with examining the SIT note and recommending initiation of suitable action, if deemed necessary, against erring committee members and senior TTD officers.\nThe committee will specifically look into administrative lapses in the relaxation and enforcement of tender conditions. It will also examine whether decisions were taken with due diligence, proper recorded justification and procedural compliance.\nALSO READ: Tirupati Laddu Row: Probe Finds No Action Was Taken Despite Ghee Adulteration Report In 2022\nThe panel has also been asked to identify the extent of administrative responsibility, if any, of officers, committee members or TTD functionaries in relation to the lapses flagged in the SIT report, and recommend appropriate administrative or disciplinary action.\nThe government has made it clear that the committee’s examination will be confined strictly to administrative and governance aspects.\nThe move comes after the state Cabinet, in its last meeting, announced that a separate panel would be set up to examine the SIT report. The latest order formally gives effect to that decision.\nThe government order refers to the FIR/ Crime No. 470/2024 was registered at Tirupati East Police Station over the alleged supply of adulterated and sub-standard ghee to TTD.\nIt also references the Supreme Court, through its October 4, 2024 order in W.P.(C) No. 622/2024 where it entrusted the investigation to an independent SIT functioning under the supervision of the Director of the Central Bureau of Investigation.\nAfter completing the investigation, the SIT filed its charge sheet before the court on January 23, 2026. Along with this, it submitted a self-contained note recommending that suitable action be initiated against committee members and senior TTD officers for lapses, omissions and failures in both relaxing and enforcing ghee tender conditions.\nIt is based on these findings that the government has now constituted the one-man committee.\nThe committee has been given the power to call for records, seek written clarifications and obtain expert assistance, subject to prior government approval. It has been directed to submit its report within 45 days from the date of the order.\nThe Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams will provide the necessary secretariat assistance to the panel.\nThe government has also clarified that the report will be recommendatory in nature and will be examined before any further action is taken.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "Days after India joined 100 countries in signing a joint statement that criticised Israel’s “unilateral\" measures in the occupied West Bank, the Ministry of External Affairs said on Friday that it was not a negotiated document and India’s position was already expressed in the India-Arab League Ministerial Joint Statement.\n“You may be aware that this was not a negotiated document as is usually the case in the UN. Our position on this issue was most recently expressed in the India-Arab League Ministerial Joint statement,\" said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal during a press briefing.\nJaiswal was referring to the India-Arab Foreign Ministers’ meeting last month, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi reiterated India’s continued support for the people of Palestine and welcomed ongoing peace efforts, including the Gaza peace plan.\n“‘Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to achieving a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace in the Middle East, according to international law, relevant UN resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative. They called for a sovereign, independent and viable State of Palestine based on 1967 borders, living side by side in peace with Israel. Both parties supported the practice of inalienable rights of the Palestinian people,\" read a joint statement issued by India and Arab countries.\nThe MEA clarified that India has associated itself with the initiative, keeping in mind the concerns addressed by the statement.\nIsrael’s West Bank Plans\nAt least 100 countries, including Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, the League of Arab States, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the European Union, signed the statement condemning Israel’s plans for the annexation of the West Bank.\nThe joint statement said, “We strongly condemn unilateral Israeli decisions and measures aimed at expanding Israel’s unlawful presence in the West Bank. Such decisions are contrary to Israel’s obligations under international law and must be immediately reversed.\"\nIt underlined strong opposition to any form of annexation and rejected all measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem.\nThis came after Israel’s cabinet on Sunday approved further measures to tighten Israel’s control over the occupied West Bank and make it easier for settlers to buy land. Palestinians termed this move “de-facto annexation.\" The foreign ministry said the measure would promote transparency and help resolve land disputes.\nThe West Bank is among the territories that Palestinians seek for a future independent state. However, many on Israel’s religious right view it as Israeli land.\nThe Palestinian presidency condemned the step, saying it constitutes “a de-facto annexation of occupied Palestinian territory and a declaration of the commencement of annexation plans aimed at entrenching the occupation through illegal settlement activity.\"\n(with inputs from agencies)\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "‘Existed Earlier, Exists Now’: Karnataka Minister Admits 'Commission' Culture Amid Contractor Row",
        "content": "A political controversy has erupted in Karnataka after Public Works Minister Satish Jarkiholi acknowledged that the practice of “commissions\" or kickbacks continues within the state’s governance system.\nThe minister’s remarks come amid mounting tensions with the Karnataka State Contractors Association (KSCA) announcing a statewide protest on March 6, alleging that the government has failed to clear pending bills amounting to ₹37,370 crore.\nThe association has accused the Congress-led government of presiding over worsening corruption and administrative paralysis, intensifying the political heat around infrastructure projects.\n\n\nResponding to questions on allegations of commission-taking in the Public Works Department (PWD), Jarkiholi made an unusually candid statement.\n“That’s there. It was there before. It’s there now. It will be there in future. It’s difficult to trace where exactly it happens. Allegations keep coming from different sides. It existed earlier, it exists today, and it may exist tomorrow as well. But it has to be controlled. We must put an end to it,\" the minister said.\nThe comments have triggered sharp political reactions, particularly because the Congress swept to power in 2023 after targeting the previous BJP government over the alleged “40 per cent commission\" culture in public works.\nJarkiholi’s statement is being viewed by critics as an implicit admission that illegal payments and systemic corruption remain deeply entrenched within sections of the bureaucracy, despite the government’s promises of reform and transparency.\n\n\nThe controversy has gained further traction with contractors warning of a deepening financial crisis due to unpaid dues. The KSCA claims that prolonged delays in payments have pushed many contractors to the brink, stalling development works across the state.\nThe March 6 protest is expected to intensify pressure on the Congress administration to urgently clear bills and restore confidence within the infrastructure sector.\nThe issue is politically sensitive for Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, whose government had projected itself as a clean and accountable alternative to the previous regime.\n\n\nThe opposition Bharatiya Janata Party seized on the minister’s remarks to mount a fierce attack on the government. Leader of Opposition R Ashoka accused the Congress of hypocrisy, alleging that corruption remains central to its governance.\n“He has admitted this because he is also corrupt. Corruption has been there since independence and its foundation was laid by the Congress. This is a shame for the Congress government. The minister has openly accepted that the party is corrupt,\" Ashoka alleged.\nLatest Blogs",

In that context, the most advanced two-nanometer chips are being designed in India today. A complete ecosystem is emerging in India. Pax Silica will be crucial for this, and the youth of India will benefit from it”, he said.\nPax Silica is a US-led multilateral initiative launched in December 2025, with the aim to create a secure, resilient supply chain for semiconductors, AI technology, and critical minerals.

There have been some glitches, but these things happen in a large event. What has been impressive is the attendance of Presidents, Prime Ministers, and world leaders, and they’ve come with a strong message of wanting to see a newly integrated world in AI development, where the impact upon society would be the Principle. Preoccupation in India has clearly led the drive in this area. As far as the French Rafale is concerned, parts of it are being manufactured in India, and that is a very important aspect of the deal because it is part of strengthening our defence, but also increasing our self-reliance in the defence sector… Defence is important for India not because we want to go to war, but because we don’t want others to think that we are so weak that they can be tempted to go to war. It is a defensive defence literally, and I support the government on that.”\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "An immigration officer has allegedly lost Rs 79 lakh after falling victim to a sophisticated cryptocurrency investment fraud, police said on Thursday.\nThe 41-year-old officer working at Malaysia’s consulate general office in Mumbai, approached the police authorities around one-and-a-half years after the incident, citing severe mental stress and fear of social stigma, officials from the East Region Cyber Police said.\nAn official said that in January 2024, the officer was added to a WhatsApp group called “EG Plan,\" where members frequently shared updates and tips related to share trading. Having a basic understanding of the stock market, he found the content credible. Following the group’s guidance, he signed up on a company website and started investing.\nOver time, he transferred funds through online transactions and RTGS to more than 18 different bank accounts. In the beginning, he received returns of Rs 1.69 lakh, which boosted his confidence in the scheme.\nEncouraged by the initial payout, he went on to invest around Rs 78.85 lakh between April 2024 and June 2025, believing he was putting the money into cryptocurrency trading, the official added.\nWhen he attempted to withdraw his investment and profits, the fraudsters allegedly demanded an additional Rs 18 lakh as “processing fee\". But after he refused to pay, all the communication was cut off.\nHe later informed his bank, which advised him to approach the police.\nFollowing his complaint, police registered a case against 10 unidentified persons under charges of criminal conspiracy and cheating, along with relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act.\nPolice are currently tracing the bank accounts where the funds were transferred and identifying the account holders, the official said, adding that investigation was underway.\n(With inputs from PTI)\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "RSS Affiliate Laghu Udyog Bharati Urges Govt To Drop Blue Line Plan For Antimicrobial Drugs",
        "content": "A month after the central government mandated marking antimicrobial drugs with a conspicuous blue vertical line, RSS-affiliated Laghu Udyog Bharati (LUB) has urged the health ministry not to proceed with the final notification, arguing that the move would impose heavy economic and environmental costs without meaningfully addressing antimicrobial misuse.\nIn a letter dated February 18, seen by News18, LUB has requested the government “to reconsider the proposed amendment under global prospective and consider our above factful submission and do not go for final notification\".\nLUB is an all-India organisation representing micro and small enterprises (MSMEs) and claims to represent over 64,000 members across the country.\nThe blue line proposal was introduced through draft notification in January, proposing an amendment to Rule 96 of the Drugs Rules, 1945, to mandate “a conspicuous blue vertical strip on the labels of antimicrobial drugs\".\nAntimicrobial drugs include antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals and antiparasitic medicines used to treat infections caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites. India has been grappling with rising antimicrobial resistance (AMR), largely driven by irrational use, self-medication and over-the-counter availability of antibiotics despite prescription requirements.\nThe proposed blue line is intended to function as a clear visual identifier, reinforcing that these medicines should be used strictly under medical supervision. It builds on earlier regulatory efforts such as the red line warning introduced in 1993 and the later red box warning under Schedule H1.\nHowever, LUB argues that past visual labelling interventions have not significantly altered misuse patterns. In its letter, the organisation states, “Experience from earlier labelling interventions shows that such changes do not materially impact misuse.\" It notes that despite decades of red line and red box warnings, “irrational use and over-the-counter sale of antibiotics continue\".\nIn its representation, seen by News18, LUB contends that the amendment would require manufacturers to redesign labels, revise approved artworks and discard existing packaging material. “The proposed requirement will necessitate redesigning of labels, revision of approved artworks, and disposal of existing printed packaging material, resulting in significant financial and operational burden, particularly for MSME manufacturers,\" the letter said. It warns that sudden implementation could lead to “losses running into crores of rupees for even a single manufacturing unit\".\nThe organisation also flags environmental implications, pointing out that pharmaceutical packaging relies on pre-printed aluminium foils and specialised printing cylinders. Large-scale destruction of these materials, it said, would generate industrial waste and increase pollution. The letter cautions that repeated labelling changes would lead to “high economic and environmental costs without delivering commensurate public health benefits\".\nLUB further argues that antimicrobial drugs are already governed under Schedule H and Schedule H1 with specific labelling and prescription requirements. According to the letter, “The addition of another visual identifier, such as a blue line, may create confusion among healthcare professionals and patients rather than improving rational use.\" It also raises concerns that mandatory domestic labelling changes could disrupt export packaging and regulatory harmonisation, potentially affecting manufacturing efficiency and India’s competitiveness.\nUltimately, the organisation maintains that the core issue lies in weak enforcement at the distribution and retail level. “Antimicrobial misuse is primarily driven by weak enforcement at the distribution and retail level, where antibiotics continue to be available over the counter despite existing legal restrictions,\" the letter stated, suggesting stronger enforcement and accountability measures rather than additional visual markers.\nConcluding the letter, LUB has urged the ministry to take a broader view before proceeding, stating: “In view of the above, we humbly request the ministry to reconsider the proposed amendment under global prospective and consider our above factful submission and do not go for final notification.\"\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "After the recent elections in Bangladesh, intelligence agencies in India have sounded an alarm over Rohingya refugees, illegal immigration, terror networks and demographic changes in West Bengal ahead of the upcoming Assembly polls, sources told CNN-News18.\nIn an election marred by violence targeting religious minorities and widespread irregularities, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), led by former PM Khaleda Zia’s son Tarique Rahman, secured a strong mandate, winning 209 of the 299 seats, while the Jamaat-e-Islami secured 68 seats, making it the chief opposition party. Ousted PM Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League was banned from contesting the polls.\nHowever, intelligence agencies have warned that Pakistan’s ISI is colluding with the Jamaat-e-Islami and using its seats in Bangladesh’s Satkhira and Chuadanga to push illegal immigrants into West Bengal’s Nadia and Murshidabad districts, according to sources.\nAdditionally, Jamaat’s radical spread is being used to activate terror sleeper cells in North 24 Parganas to influence voter turnout during the West Bengal Assembly elections, sources said. These sleeper cells are also aiming to disrupt the elections in Malda.\nALSO READ: Mamata Banerjee Fact-Checked: What Bangladesh Election Data Shows On Minority Representation | Exclusive\nAttempts At Demographic Change In Bengal\nAccording to sources, Malda’s Muslim population is estimated at 55-60%, which is mainly due to cross-border migration and Jamaat-e-Islami’s victory in Bangladesh’s Chapainawabganj, which lies close to Bengal’s Malda and Murshidabad districts.\nAdditionally, intelligence agencies warned of attempts at demographic change and settlements of sleeper cells affiliated with terror groups with the help of Rohingya networks.\nGroups such as ARSA (Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army), RSO (Rohingya Solidarity Organisation), and JMB (Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh) are likely to coordinate their activities in Cox’s Bazar following the Bangladesh elections. This is expected to affect West Bengal’s Uttar Dinajpur district, with madrasa-linked networks in Birbhum potentially serving as key hubs.\nPakistan-China-Bangladesh Links\nIntelligence reports also pointed to links involving Pakistan and China, allegedly aimed at targeting Siliguri through the Kurigram airbase. Jamaat’s ideological infiltration into West Bengal’s borders could have potential for communal riots in Jalpaiguri and may impact voter safety and Trinamool Congress’ (TMC) hold in 2026.\nSeveral steps have been taken recently to address the issue, including the return of a large number of undocumented Bangladeshis in North 24 Parganas during the Election Commission’s Special Intensive Revision (SIR) process. BSF reported that at least 150–200 people are returning daily after verification, biometric checks and screening of criminal records.\nMigrants working as ragpickers, labourers or domestic workers, who have been living in India for more than 10 years using forged Aadhaar cards, voter IDs, and ration cards, are also returning due to fear of arrest and imprisonment linked to the SIR exercise.\nLatest Blogs",

The court said it was “shocking to note the callous and casual manner in which records are maintained, and the income generated from the sale of sacred offerings is accounted for.\"\nThe judges observed that even a small shopkeeper would be expected to maintain better financial discipline. “Even a person running a modest petty shop would be expected to maintain far better accounting discipline to ensure that income and stock are properly reconciled,\" the court remarked.\nAccording to the proceedings, ghee packets were issued to counters after being recorded in notebooks informally referred to as “Kutti Books\". Separate notebooks were maintained for each counter and kept in the temple office. These books recorded the number of packets issued along with the signatures of the staff receiving them.\nInvestigating officers produced one such 200-page school notebook before the court, relating to the Maramathu-II counter.
