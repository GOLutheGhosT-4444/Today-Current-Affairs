This integrated project, estimated to cost ₹80,000-90,000 crore, has been at the centre of a debate between national interests and the preservation of one of the world’s most sensitive ecosystems.\nThe project is an integrated infrastructure development plan proposed by the Andaman and Nicobar Islands Integrated Development Corporation Limited (ANIIDCO). It consists of four major components: an International Container Transshipment Terminal (ICTT), a 450 MVA gas and solar-based power plant, a large-scale township and area development, and an international airport. Building all of this would require diverting 130.75 square kilometres of forest land — roughly 18% of the total area of the Great Nicobar Island. It is projected to generate over 1.28 lakh jobs by the time it is fully implemented in 2052. However, the inevitable environmental impact of this project has prompted global outrage.\nThe project’s regulatory journey began in May 2021 with a Stage-I forest clearance granted in October 2022, followed by environmental and Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) clearances on November 11, 2022. These clearances were challenged in a “first round” of litigation in 2022. On April 3, 2023, the NGT found “unanswered deficiencies” regarding coral conservation, the adequacy of environmental data, and zoning violations. The tribunal then formed a High-Powered Committee (HPC) to revisit these issues. The final order issued this month is the result of the “second round” of litigation, where the tribunal reviewed the HPC’s findings and the government’s subsequent actions.\nThe government maintains that the project is of extraordinary strategic, defence, and national importance. The Great Nicobar is located just 40 km from the Malacca Strait, a critical international shipping lane. The area is seen as a vital location to counter the “growing presence” of foreign powers in the Indian Ocean. By establishing a major cargo transshipment hub, India can participate more fully in the global maritime economy and save significant costs on cargo that is currently transshipped through foreign ports. A permanent, robust presence on the island is expected to curb the poaching of marine resources by foreign entities.\nThe island is a biodiversity hotspot, and the project faces several ecological challenges. Initial surveys identified 20,668 coral colonies in the vicinity. While Island CRZ regulations prohibit the “destruction of corals”, the project involves the translocation of 16,150 colonies to suitable recipient sites. The island is home to the Leatherback Sea Turtle, the Nicobar Megapode, and the Saltwater Crocodile. Critics argued that the construction would destroy nesting grounds in Galathea Bay. A major point of contention was whether the port layout overlapped with Island CRZ-IA areas, which are the most ecologically sensitive zones (like mangroves and sand dunes) where heavy construction is strictly prohibited. Environmentalists argued that the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was based on only one season of baseline data, which they claimed was insufficient for a project of this magnitude. Critics have also raised concerns that the environmental impact studies downplay the seismic risks of the region, which is located in a high-activity tectonic zone.\nThe island is inhabited by the Shompen and Nicobari tribes. The NGT noted the following regarding tribal rights — the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC), which advises the Centre on environmental clearances, found that the project is designed not to disturb or displace any tribal habitation. The tribunal stated that the habitat rights of the tribes would be protected under the Forest Rights Act, though as recently as last month some of the leaders of the tribal council said that they were being “coerced” to sign ‘surrender’ certificates noting that they have no objection to their lands being given to the government. ANIIDCO is required to provide funds to the A&N Tribal Welfare Department for the welfare and protection of the tribal groups.\nThe tribunal ultimately upheld the environmental clearance, adopting a “balanced approach” that weighed environmental safeguards against national security. The NGT ruled that while EIA procedures are mandatory, they should not be used to adopt a “hyper-technical approach” that ignores ground realities and national security. It accepted the Zoological Survey of India’s (ZSI) finding that no “major” coral reef exists in the direct work area of Galathea Bay, only “scattered” colonies. It ruled that translocation would effectively protect the colonies. Following a site visit by the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM), the tribunal accepted that no part of the port project fell within the prohibited ICRZ-IA zone. The tribunal also ruled that one-season data was sufficient because the islands are not classified as a “high erosion” stretch where multi-season data is mandatory.\nWith the NGT according legal clearance, the ANIIDCO can move ahead with project development. The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways is also expected to move on port development activities.\nPublished - February 22, 2026 04:02 am IST\nenvironmental issues\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Andaman and Nicobar Islands\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        The Hindu Explains\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        environmental pollution\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

I had NSG security, but it was withdrawn.

Admission will be either through an in-house qualifier exam or through eligibility to appear for JEE Advanced.\nLaunching the course, V. Kamakoti, Director, IIT Madras, said, “Entry (to the course) is relatively easy but the exit is extremely hard.” He said there were 50 million students in higher education in India today, which necessitated the democratisation of education. These online courses were a step in that direction.\nBefore this, IIT Madras had been running online BS programmes in Data Science and Programming, Electronic Systems, and Aeronautics and Space Technology.\nGangapriya Chakraverti, India Site Head and Managing Director, Ford Motor Company, said whether at the bank, or a retail chain, or in a manufacturing plant, the most valued asset isn’t always capital or the people; it could be the data. “But any data in a vacuum is completely useless. It requires management, requires the ability to ask the right questions, ability to lead teams, and ability to take ethical and strategic decisions,” she observed. The programme, she said, was a business degree of and for the data age.\nRajiv C. Lochan, Managing Director and CEO, Sundaram Finance, said the programme has been designed to contain audio, video, text, digital, and offline peer groups, collaboration, debate and discussion and, therefore, an opportunity for retrospection and reflection.\nGiving details about the course, Prathap Haridoss, Dean, Academic Courses, IIT Madras, said, though mostly online, the BS has a hybrid mode with certain project submissions, lab activities, and all assessments requiring in-person presence.\nThe first batch of the course will commence from June 2026 and the last date for submission of application is May 31.

Sneha handed over the appointment orders to the school dropouts, Suresh Vadivel, 27, and Thangarasu Masi, 35. The former has been appointed as a gardener, and the latter as a night watchman at the Ekalaiva Model Residential School at Kumili near Kalavai.\nThe jobs have been provided to the wards of the snake catchers as their fathers are too old to be given government employment.\n“We are happy that we have a proper job now. We will definitely get better pay, and that too, throughout the year. Snake catching is only seasonal. We get just ₹650/day if we work as construction labourers, which is not enough to manage our families,” they said.\nMr. Vadivel, who is a licensed snake catcher, said that with this salary, they would definitely educate their children. “Education is the only way forward. Many people in our community are illiterate. We quit studies since the school in our village, Chenneri, has only till Class 8. The nearest schools are at Tiruporur, which is 10 km away, and Chengalpattu, at a distance of 13 km. We cannot travel so much for the sake of school,” he said.\nMr. Masi said that he did not learn snake catching since his father did not want him to continue the family trade. “I hunt for other jobs to keep my family afloat. I have two girl children,” he added.\nPublished - February 22, 2026 12:03 am IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Stalin launched the initiative during a function in Chennai. SimpleGov, a governance reform initiative of the Tamil Nadu government, was instituted in 2023 aimed at systematically simplifying rules, procedures, approvals and service delivery mechanisms across departments.\n“The idea is to gradually ensure that all the government services are easy to access,” explained retired IAS officer P.W.C. Davidar, who is now the Advisor for SimpleGov initiative. In the first phase, the Chief Minister launched the simplification, digitisation and process re-engineering of 10 government services in May 2025. In some cases, a revised process flow has reduced timelines from a year and a half to just 30-45 minutes.\nAuto-generated licences with QR codes, among others, have significantly reduced the time taken for process completion, he said.\nThese simplification efforts, however, were far from simple as several Acts and government orders had to be amended accordingly to facilitate the process. In some services, about 25 to 30 steps that were in practice for over 40 to 50 years were brought down to three steps, Mr. Davidar said, adding, “In effect, it is reworking the process flow of government services.”\nThe three major stages in a process were establishing the identity of the applicant, verifying eligibility and providing the final order. “We have simplified each of these steps.”\nThough Aadhaar was made the identity document in most cases, provision has also been made to use ration card as identity proof in some cases. As for organisations, PAN card has been made the identity document. “We have made the process so simple that it will only ask the applicant for what is absolutely necessary for that service,” Mr. Davidar explained.\nSimpleGov has had significant impact on G2C (Government to Citizen), G2B (Government to Business), and G2G (Government to Government) services and has cross-sectoral applicability, covering citizen services, welfare schemes, business-facing approvals, and inter-departmental processes. “The orders issued will now be translated into an online application shortly.”\nSome of the 55 services whose processes have been simplified include: registration for the Chief Minister’s Uzhavar Pathukappu Thittam; assistance schemes for inter-caste marriage, widow remarriage, and orphan girl children; pensions for destitute, deserted, and unmarried women; registration of childcare institutions; and marriage assistance for persons with disabilities; renewal or name change/address change in driving licences; fire licences for buildings; and licensing for lifts and escalators.\nPublished - February 21, 2026 11:50 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

The college was founded by the Hyderabad Karnataka Education (HKE) Society in 1958.\nHighlighting India’s growing stature in education, he noted that after the United States, the United Kingdom, and China, India is making significant strides in the academic sphere. In the QS World University Rankings 2026, a record 54 Indian institutions have been featured, marking a substantial rise in global representation. He expressed confidence that within the next five years, at least 100 Indian institutions are expected to figure in the QS World University Rankings, reflecting the transformative progress under way in higher education.\nEmphasising on India’s expanding research ecosystem, Mr. Joshi stated that the country’s expenditure on Research and Development (R&D) stands at ₹1.27 lakh crore. The annual patent application filings have increased to 92,000, underscoring India’s growing prominence as a global hub for science, technology, and innovation. As per the Science and Engineering (S&E) Indicators 2022 published by the U.S. National Science Foundation, India ranks third globally in Science and Engineering PhDs, after the United States and China.\nReferring to the hosting of an AI Impact Summit 2026 in India for the first time, Mr. Joshi called it a matter of pride and noted that the Union government is investing over ₹10,300 crore in AI innovation under the India AI Mission to strengthen computing infrastructure, data access, skilling, and governance frameworks. In addition, the Union Budget 2026-27 has allocated ₹40,000 crore for India Semiconductor Mission (ISM) 2.0 to boost indigenous semiconductor manufacturing. He observed that while manufacturing is slowing in some countries, it is growing in India.\nMr. Joshi stressed that educational institutions must focus on imparting quality skills beyond degrees and expressed confidence that the institution can achieve top rankings in the coming years.\nPraising the institution’s decades of service in delivering quality education and shaping successful professionals, he urged alumni to give back through mentorship, guidance, and support to help strengthen the foundation for future generations.\nEshwar B. Khandre, Minister for Forest, Ecology and Environment, and Sharanabasappa Darshanapur, Minister for Small Scale Industries and Public Enterprises, both alumni of the institution, lauded the vision of Mahadevappa Rampure and others in establishing the HKE Society six decades ago to provide affordable, quality education. They fondly recalled their college days and thanked their teachers for shaping their career.\nSurender Pal Singh Saluja, chairman of Premier Energies and alumnus, was the chief guest on the occasion.\nHKE Society president Shashil G. Namoshi, former DGP Raghavendra Auradkar, and MLCs Sunil Vallyapure and Jagdev Guttedar were present.\nPublished - February 21, 2026 11:46 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

This has been done even though the State, after 2022-23, has been increasingly under fiscal strain. The improvement witnessed in 2022-23 was primarily attributed to the economic recovery all over the country after being hit by the COVID-19 pandemic for two years from 2020. Since 2023-24, one of the factors that contributed to the rise in revenue expenditure was the implementation of the Kalaignar Magalir Urimai Thittam, wherein nearly 1.31 crore women are now being paid ₹1,000 every month. A few weeks ago, all the beneficiaries received ₹5,000 which included the payment for the next two months coupled with a “special summer assistance” of ₹2,000.\nThe two principal political parties — the AIADMK and the ruling DMK — have assured people that in the event of victory in the Assembly election, they will increase the monthly assistance to ₹2,000 per beneficiary. The AIADMK’s offer is for all ration card holders, numbering around 2.25 crore.\nThough the component of expenditure on account of Kalaignar Magalir Urimai Thittam will be around ₹15,720 crore only for the next year under the existing conditions, the State government has been, even otherwise, incurring huge expenditure with regard to electricity subsidy in the form of free power to over 2.3 crore domestic consumers up to 100 units bimonthly and 23.86 lakh agricultural connections. Also, it is absorbing the entire financial loss incurred by the Tamil Nadu Power Distribution Corporation Limited (TNPDCL).\nFinance Minister Thangam Thennarasu, in his Budget speech on February 17, 2026, had said the Union government had mandated that the State government pay an amount of about ₹16,300 crore to the TNPDCL towards loss funding, even though the State government’s calculations revealed that the the actual loss would be only ₹413 crore this year.\nThe balance has to be paid in the current year. Also, the Centre’s imposition of the condition for maintaining 5% of outstanding guarantees in the Guarantee Redemption Fund (GRF) had led to an unbudgeted expenditure of about ₹3,100 crore. It was no wonder that revenue expenditure for the current year went up to nearly ₹3.79 lakh crore (Revised Estimates) from around ₹3.29 lakh crore during 2024-25.\nThe State gets one-thirds of its total Revenue Receipts from the Centre in the form of share of Central Taxes and grants in aid. Even in this area, there has been a perceptible fall in the quantum of grants since 2023-24. During 2022-23, the State received about ₹37,730 crore as grants in aid and this shrunk to ₹16,509 crore two years later. The State expects only about ₹24,760 crore even in 2026-27.\nNotwithstanding the challenges, the State government officials are hopeful of the government sticking to statutory norms with regard to fiscal management, citing their track record. Referring to the savings of about ₹5,710 crore in non-development expenditure, they are optimistic about achieving the targets, which have, of course, been set in “the absence of new external fiscal challenges”.\nRE-Revised Estimate; BE-Budget Estimate; RR-Revenue Receipts; GSDP-Gross State Domestic Product; SORR-State’s Own Revenue Receipts; and RE-Revenue Expenditure\nSource: Interim State Budget document for 2026-27 and the Budget Memoranda (Part-I) of the Tamil Nadu government’s Finance Department for the last five years\nPublished - February 21, 2026 11:18 pm IST\nsubsidy\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        public finance\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        economy, business and finance\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Tamil Nadu\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        electricity production and distribution\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Leaders of other political parties also condemned the incident.\nIn Mumbai, BJP workers showed black flags to Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi in Thane when he was en route by road to Bhiwandi for an appearance before a court in a 2014 defamation case. While the BJP Yuva Morcha organised a demonstration in Delhi, protests were also staged in Jammu, Jaipur, Surat, and other places.\nAt a press conference, Union Minister Kiren Rijiju accused the Congress of committing a “grave crime”.\n“We thought that if the party had even a little bit of concern for the country, it would introspect and apologise. However, this morning, we saw many Congress leaders justifying this brazen misconduct,” he said.\nHe said praise was pouring in from everywhere, with many prominent figures from leading countries, including heads of state, acknowledging the summit organised under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to showcase India’s progress in the field of AI. This was when the Youth Congress workers went to the venue and performed a “naked dance”.\nOn Friday (February 20), the IYC workers arrived at the venue of the summit, removed their T-shirts, turned them inside out to display printed catchphrases and images and raised slogans against Centre’s trade deal with the U.S.\nExpressing shock over the Congress defending the IYC protesters, Mr. Rijiju said: “They claim this is the anger of the youth. If the anger of the youth is used to defame India in front of the world, then nothing could be more shameful than this...there cannot be any politics over anything done in national interest, no matter who is in power.”\n“But for some time now, we have been witnessing the Congress’s frustration as they cannot win elections and are unable to gain the trust of the people. Now it has become anti-national...whenever Mr. Gandhi sees India progress, he and his party become unhappy,” he said, adding that during his foreign travels too, the senior Congress leader “incites opposition against India”.\nMr. Rijiju said the BJP had been in the opposition for a long period of time, but its leaders never “spoke a word against the country”.\n“On the contrary, Congress leaders and workers are constantly conspiring to defame India. They cannot ensure the country’s prosperity and progress...therefore, not just the BJP, but the entire country has risen up and is protesting against the Congress party everywhere today,” said the BJP leader.\nLeaders of other parties across the political spectrum also reacted to the protest at the summit.\nThrough her X handle, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) president Mayawati termed the conduct of Youth Congress workers “utterly disgraceful and reprehensible”. “If this summit were not of international stature, it would be a different matter altogether. However, such conduct during the summit is a cause for concern...it should be ensured that the dignity and image of our country are not tarnished,” she said.\nBRS working president K.T. Rama Rao also posted a message on X condemning the incident as “petty political theatrics”. “Using such a global platform for protests will project our great nation India in a poor light internationally. While difference of opinion is natural in a democracy, understanding where and how to protest is very important. There is a time and place for political dissent, and an international summit is certainly not one of them,” said Mr. Rao.\nFurthermore, the BRS leader said: “And the irony is hard to miss. Youth Congress guys staged the protest precisely when their own party’s Chief Minister, Revanth Reddy, was addressing the same AI Summit”.\nTelugu Desam Party (TDP) general secretary Lokesh Nara said he was shocked and dismayed by the disruption caused by the IYC workers at the summit. “This global platform was meant to showcase India’s growing leadership as an emerging AI superpower. Turning such a prestigious international event into a political spectacle only diminishes our collective standing before the world. India deserves better…,” he said.\nYSR Congress (YSRCP) chief Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy also posted his statement on X, saying that “no one should ever demean our country. Whatever our political differences may be, we should always present a united face to the world”.\nPublished - February 21, 2026 11:10 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Patil, Minister for Law, Justice and Human Rights, Parliamentary Affairs, Legislation and Tourism, and district in-charge Minister of Gadag.\nHe was speaking at the inauguration of the Belagavi division-level technical conference on animal husbandry and animal welfare for 2025–26, held at Mahatma Gandhi Rural Development and Panchayat Raj University (Gram Gangotri) in Nagavi, near Gadag, on February 21.\nThe conference was jointly organised by the Gadag District Panchayat, Department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services, Karnataka Animal Welfare Board (Bengaluru), Karnataka Veterinary Association (Gadag), and Humane World for Animals India Foundation.\nDr. Patil said the animal husbandry sector forms the backbone of the rural economy, and farmers’ income can be enhanced by adopting scientific methods, modern technology, and animal welfare practices.\nHe said that while dairy farming had flourished in regions such as Kolar and Mandya and in neighbouring Maharashtra, growth in North Karnataka was comparatively slow, and stressed the need to examine the reasons.\n“Insufficient focus on animal husbandry has affected rural wealth creation. Modern dairy farming and technology-driven practices can significantly improve farmers’ economic conditions,” he said, suggesting that officials submit necessary proposals and assuring that viable measures would be considered in the next Budget.\nS.V. Sankanur, MLC, said that substantial funds are being provided by the Union government and State government for research, and these must be effectively utilised. He emphasised that the conference should promote practical implementation of scientific knowledge in dairy, sheep, and poultry farming.\nThe conference featured technical sessions and discussions on innovative animal health management practices. Senior officials H. Nagaraj, H.B. Hulagannavar, R.Y. Gurikar, Bahubali Jain, and others were present.\nPublished - February 21, 2026 10:25 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

The police also claimed that the aim of the custodial interrogation was to find out the ‘conspiracy’ behind the protest, the source of funding and place where the T-shirts worn by the accused were printed at.\nThe counsel appearing for the IYC workers objected to the custody request by the police. He argued that the arrested youths were associated with a political party and had exercised their democratic right to protest peacefully. He added that the arrest of protesters had ‘greatly diminished the dignity of democracy’.\nPublished - February 21, 2026 09:50 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

File \n                                          | Photo Credit: Sushil Kumar Verma\nThe Election Commission of India (ECI) has decided to deploy central armed police forces (CAPF) in West Bengal from March 1, 2026, likely ahead of the announcement of the schedule for the Assembly elections in the poll-bound State.\nAbout 480 companies of forces will be deployed in two phases in West Bengal by March 10. In the first phase, about 240 companies of CAPF will arrive in the State on March 1. The remaining 240 companies will be deployed on March 10.\nSources at the Commission said that the early deployment of CAPF was a confidence-building measure for the electors of West Bengal. The deployment of CAPF has often been a subject of political debate, particularly due to the high incidence of political violence in the State. Earlier on several occasions, including during the local polls, the Trinamool Congress has opposed the deployment of central forces.\nThe letter sent by the Union Home Ministry to the State’s Chief Secretary, Home Secretary and State Director General of Police regarding the deployment of CAPF gives a break up on the central forces deployed on March 1. In the first phase, about 110 companies of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), 55 companies of the Border Security Force (BSF), 27 companies of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), 27 companies of the Seema Suraksha Bal (SSB) and 21 companies of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), will reach the State by March 1.\nIn the second phase, the deployment will comprise 120 companies of CRPF, 65 companies of BSF, 20 companies of ITBP, 19 companies of SSB and 16 companies of CISF.\nAfter the completion of special intensive revision (SIR), the final electoral rolls of West Bengal are scheduled to be published on February 28. Since the deployment will be made on the very next day, it is not likely that the dates of the elections will be announced in the State before March 1.\nIn the 2021 Assembly polls, which were held in eight phases, about 1,100 companies of CAPF were deployed.\nPublished - February 21, 2026 09:48 pm IST\nKolkata\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        West Bengal\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        politics\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        politics (general)\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Election Commission of India\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Visiting professors are improving the educational environment there. Why is that not possible here?” Chief Minister Siddaramaiah asked at a review meeting with the Vice-Chancellors of all public universities in the State, chaired by the Governor of Karnataka.\nSpeaking at the meeting held at Karnataka Higher Education Council on Saturday, he, however, promised that steps would be taken to fill 2,000 posts in degree and technical education colleges. “We will allow filling up of vacant posts in universities this year,” he added.\nMr. Siddaramaiah went on to say that universities are becoming “caste dens” and efforts should be made to bring youth out of this trap. He called upon the V-Cs of the Public Universities to ensure this.\n“Universities should introduce students to the developments taking place in the world. A platform should be prepared to make students global citizens. Scientific and rationality should be cultivated beyond caste, creed and religion,” he said.\n“Karnataka is at the forefront of higher education in the country. Not just education, but also providing employment opportunities to students is the government’s priority. Therefore, a scheme to adopt about 100 engineering colleges in collaboration with industries is under way. Under the Naipuna Karnataka scheme, industry-based skill training is being provided to 1 lakh students annually,”  he said, adding that Vice-Chancellors should ensure that the university curriculum is in line with global standards.\nSpeaking about the resources of universities, he said, “Universities should not rely solely on government funds but should mobilise resources through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds and alumni networks,” he stated.\nSpeaking earlier, Governor Thaawarchand Gehlot appealed to the Chief Minister to present the forthcoming State Budget in a manner that is more beneficial to the Higher Education sector. The Governor emphasised that universities, having limited internal revenue sources, require special financial care and structured budgetary support.\nHe particularly stressed the need to permit filling long-pending vacancies in institutions such as Karnataka State Dr. Gangubai Hangal Music and Performing Arts University, Karnataka Sanskrit University, Kannada University, Karnataka Janapada University, and Dr. B.R. Ambedkar School of Economics University.\nHigher Education Minister Dr. M.C. Sudhakar said that along with the financial assistance from the government, universities should strictly follow financial discipline, transparency and accountability. He opined that there is a need to give a new impetus to research activities.\nPublished - February 21, 2026 09:46 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

The said letter has been forwarded to the Defence Secretary to the Government of India for appropriate attention,” the letter said.\nIn his representation, the MLA flagged delays in implementing a Central government policy approved more than four years ago to restructure cantonment administration. He also drew attention to the financial strain on civic services in the cantonment, alleging that unpaid service charges amounting to ₹1,200 crore are owed by the Central government to the Secunderabad Cantonment Board.\nThe issue has gained prominence following an eight-day hunger strike led by the MLA from January 20 to January 27 against the continuation of a nominated setup in the cantonment board. The protest saw participation from residents who have been demanding the restoration of elected local governance and the integration of civilian areas with the city’s urban administration under the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation.\n“For too long, 4 lakh residents of Secunderabad Cantonment have lived in a democratic deficit without elected local representation. By forwarding the issue to the Defence Secretary, the President’s office had validated the residents’ struggle. We also demand a time-bound gazette notification to enable cantonment residents to participate in the upcoming GHMC elections,” said Mr. Sri Ganesh.\nPublished - February 21, 2026 08:53 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

He added that Pattaya (land title) Mission was introduced during the tenure of the present government, and that Pattaya Assemblies — which enable direct public participation — have helped resolve long-pending land title issues.\nDescribing the digital resurvey as one of the largest initiatives in Kerala’s history, the Minister said the State was the first in the country to implement comprehensive digitisation of land records. As part of a pilot phase, solar rooftop systems will soon be installed in 18 village offices in the Ollur constituency. Digital kiosks will also be set up in village offices to enable the public to directly access certificates and related documents.\nThe function was presided over by District Collector Arjun Pandian.\nPublished - February 21, 2026 08:51 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Under his leadership, BJYM activists also attacked the Congress party office in Ongole. He warned that if such incidents recur, the organisation would intensify its protests. BJYM Prakasam district general secretary Talupula Nayak and other members took part in the demonstration.\nIn Tirupati, BJYM leaders organised a dharna and criticised the Congress for what they described as attempts to disrupt national events. BJYM Tirupati district president Bandaru Partha Saradhi alleged that such actions hamper the country’s development and technological progress. He said the people had already expressed their displeasure and would deliver a clearer mandate in the days ahead.\nHe added that any move to obstruct the Prime Minister’s initiatives for the country’s development would be opposed through democratic means.\nPublished - February 21, 2026 08:50 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

The SIR was carried out across 199 Assembly constituencies in the State.\nThe names of 31.36 lakh voters were removed from the electoral rolls during the SIR, which began in November 2025. Chief Electoral Officer Naveen Mahajan said that the names were deleted because of death, permanent shifting, absence or duplication of voters detected in the large-scale verification drive.\nALSO WATCH  Election shock in Rajasthan: Hundreds seek voter name deletions without consent\nThere were 5,46,56,215 voters in the State before the SIR exercise began. As many as 41.84 lakh voters were removed in the draft list published on December 16, 2025, and since then, 12.91 lakh new voters have been added, while 2.42 lakh names have been removed from the electoral rolls.\nAmong the 200 Assembly segments in the State, Baran district’s Anta was excluded because of the by-election held on November 11, 2025. Mr. Mahajan said the final electoral roll for Anta would be announced on March 12.\nThe final electoral roll depicted a net increase of 10,48,605 voters in comparison with the draft publication, reflecting a growth of 2.08%. The districts which recorded the highest rise in voter numbers were Jaipur, Phalodi, Bharatpur, Sirohi and Bundi.\nThe gender ratio improved by two points, from 909 to 911, indicating a better female voter registration, while the number of young voters in the age group of 18 to 19 years increased by 4,35,061, showing a growth of 0.82%.\nMr. Mahajan said the updated electoral roll has been shared with political parties and uploaded on the Election Commission’s official website for public access. The booth-level officers were deployed at 61,136 polling booths in all the 41 districts during the SIR exercise, while the field representatives of eight major political parties worked with them, he said.\nThe Opposition Congress had objected to extension of deadlines for claims and objections under the SIR. A large number of Form 7 applications seeking deletion of voter names had surfaced at several places, against which the Congress had protested with the allegation that an “electoral advantage” was being given to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.\nPublished - February 21, 2026 08:44 pm IST\nRajasthan\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Election Commission of India\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        election\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        voting\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Rama Rao criticised the State government for its failure to resume work on the excavation of tunnel of Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) project after it came to a grinding halt on February 21 last year following roof collapse of the tunnel under construction burying eight workers alive.\nThe government had failed to recover/bring out the bodies from the debris, denying the families of six persons even a last sight at the mortal remains of their dear ones as over a month-long rescue operation could find only two bodies last year. In a statement, he said on Saturday that despite repeated announcements of resuming the work ‘soon’ it was yet to begin.\nOn the Youth Congress activists’ protest at the AI Summit in New Delhi on Friday, he said it was absolutely deplorable that they chose a global event involving the country’s reputation for the party’s petty political ‘theatrics’. Using such a global platform for protests would project the country in a poor light internationally, he said.\nWhile difference of opinion is natural in a democracy, such events were not the place to register political dissent. The Youth Congress chose the event which was addressed by a Chief Minister from their party (A. Revanth Reddy).\nPublished - February 21, 2026 08:43 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

And strangely, a head constable attached to the HAL police station had sent a report to the Magistrate stating that NBW could not be executed as the accused was not traceable even though he was languishing in jail for the last four years.\nThe court directed K.C. Divyashree, DIG-Prisons, to identify all similarly placed accused persons who were not produced before the jurisdictional magistrate in the last six months, take necessary steps to ensure such incidents are not repeated, and submit a report to the court by March 6.\nJustice M. Nagaprasanna passed the order on the petitions filed by Imran alias Kulla, 28, a resident of Islampura in Bengaluru.\nEarlier, Ms. Divyashree told the court that prison authorities have increased the number of para-legal volunteers to provide free legal service to poor undertrial prisoners, and a process is under way to check the undertrial prisoners who have not been produced before the jurisdictional courts for the last six months.\nThe petitioner has challenged the two criminal cases, both registered in HAL police station, pending against him besides seeking his release from the prison for the reason that his detention is illegal as he was not produced before the jurisdictional magistrate at regular intervals as per the law.\nThe Court expressed shock over the conduct of the police head constable, who, sitting in the chambers in the HAL police station and without attempting to execute the NBW, had sent the report that the accused was “not traceable” when the accused was in judicial custody for last four years in another crime registered in the same police station.\nThe court summoned Deputy Commissioner of Police (Whitefield division) Saidulu Adavath and directed him to initiate departmental enquiry against the head constable and submit an action taken report to the court by March 6.\nThe court said that it would consider next week the petitioner’s plea for his release on the already granted bail from prison by waiving the bail condition for providing surety after his advocate pointed out that the petitioner is from an economically disadvantaged background and he could not furnish surety as directed by the trial court while granting him bail.\nPublished - February 21, 2026 08:42 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

An allocation of around ₹20 crore will be provided to repair all the motors under the project, he added.\nThe Minister expressed confidence that with the development works, more than 100 cusecs of water would flow to villages in Sosale Hobli.\nPublished - February 21, 2026 08:42 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Their involvement begins with the declaration of brain stem death and continues through organ retrieval and transplantation.\n“Every deceased donor organ donation begins with brain stem death declaration, which is an intensive process in itself. Doctors are required to conduct a series of tests, including apnoea tests conducted six hours apart. Often, these doctors come from other hospitals at odd hours to assist us. Until now, we have not been able to offer them any remuneration, and they have rendered their services purely out of goodwill. However, the absence of compensation for their efforts has long been a challenge in promoting deceased donation activities,” said Noble Gracious, executive director of Kerala State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (K-SOTTO).\nThe process involves several sequential and highly coordinated activities, including brain stem death certification, grief counselling, explaining the patient’s condition to family members, obtaining consent for withdrawal of ventilator support or organ donation, haemodynamic maintenance of the body until organ retrieval is completed, organ evaluation and allocation, arranging logistics and green corridors for organ transportation, organ retrieval, transportation, and transplant surgery. Each of these stages requires the expertise and involvement of multiple professionals.\nSpecialists such as intensivists, transplant surgeons, grief counsellors, anaesthetists, ICU technicians, OT technicians, and empanelled doctors responsible for brain stem death certification play critical roles in this process. In many cases, they remain engaged for 24 to 36 hours until all procedures are completed.\n“We have been exploring since 2022 the possibility of offering professional fees for their invaluable services, so that deceased donation processes do not become a burden on them. Many have been contributing beyond their regular duty hours, and it is important that we recognise both their goodwill and their expertise,” Dr. Gracious added.\nThe executive committee of K-SOTTO, at its meeting held in January 2024, approved the proposal to provide professional fees to various categories of professionals involved in deceased organ donation, along with the corresponding rates. The government has now granted formal sanction for the proposal, and the expenditure will be met from K-SOTTO’s annual budgetary allocation.\nMedical professionals, including intensivists, organ retrieval surgeons, transplant surgeons, and anaesthetists,  will receive professional fees ranging from ₹5,000 to ₹10,000 for specified hours of service. ICU and OT technicians, transplant nurses, organ perfusionists, grief counsellors, transplant coordinators, as well as doctors and nurses accompanying the organ for transportation will also be compensated for the hours they dedicate to the process.\nPublished - February 21, 2026 08:31 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Chinchu Rani said here on Saturday (February 21, 2026).\nSpeaking at the foundation stone-laying ceremony for the Advanced Technologies in Bovine Production and Research Centre at the Kerala Livestock Development Board farm in Kulathuppuzha, the Minister highlighted the State’s steady progress, noting a current 14% increase in milk production which now stands at 25.27 lakh tonnes annually. “The government’s roadmap for the next decade focusses on enhancing the average productivity of cattle by 12.5% through the implementation of modern breeding techniques and superior genetic development,” said the Minister.\nCentral to this mission is the establishment of the new Centre of Excellence, being constructed with a total investment of ₹80 crore. Once operational, the facility will indigenously develop sex-sorted semen and IVF media that are currently imported at high costs, making advanced reproductive technologies accessible to local farmers at much lower rates. The project is launching its first phase with an initial outlay of ₹15 crore and will initially manage a herd of two hundred cattle. To complement these technical advancements, the State is also prioritising eco-friendly livestock management by providing anti-methanogenic feed supplements like Harit Dhara to reduce the environmental impact of dairy farming.\nThe Minister added that a comprehensive support system has been designed to safeguard the livelihoods of dairy farmers across the State. This includes the deployment of veterinary ambulances in every block, the establishment of heifer parks for the purchase of subsidised cattle, and the introduction of a Statewide comprehensive insurance scheme. Additionally, the government plans to distribute lab-produced embryos and high-quality semen directly to farmers to ensure the long-term genetic health of Kerala’s livestock. Noting that Milma remains a profitable venture in the State, the Minister said that these integrated efforts will solidify Kerala’s position as a leader in dairy and livestock productivity.\nThe ceremony, presided over by P.S. Supal, MLA, concluded with the exchange of a Memorandum of Understanding for a secondary research unit in Mattupetty. Key officials including KLD Board managing director R. Rajeev and Kulathuppuzha grama panchayat president Sainaba Beevi also spoke on the occasion.\nPublished - February 21, 2026 08:26 pm IST\nCopyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

        "title": "One Call Home: Indian Govt Plans Global Toll-Free Passport Helpline | Exclusive",
        "content": "The Government of India is preparing to introduce an international toll-free number service that will allow Indian citizens abroad to connect directly with passport support services in India—without paying for the call. There will be no international calling charges and no complicated routing. Just a single number that works.\nFor millions of Indians living, studying, and working abroad, questions about passport renewal, reissue, or urgent grievances can come at stressful moments—a lost passport before a flight, a name correction needed for a visa, or a delay that threatens a job opportunity. In those moments, what matters most is simple access to help.\nThe Ministry of External Affairs is now working to make that access easier than ever. CNN-News18 has accessed a document that has details of the proposal.\nThe proposed international toll-free number service is designed to bridge physical distance with seamless communication. Citizens calling from outside India will dial a dedicated toll-free number from their respective countries.\nThat call will automatically land at the existing Passport Seva Programme Contact Centres located in India. The experience will feel local to the caller, even if the support team is thousands of miles away. The objective is inclusivity—ensuring that even citizens in countries without an Indian embassy or consulate can still reach help.\nFor a student in Europe who has misplaced her passport or a worker in West Asia needing urgent clarification, the process will be straightforward. Dial the toll-free number. Speak to a trained representative. Receive guidance. Raise a grievance if required. All without worrying about international call charges.\nUnder the proposed framework, the selected telecommunications service provider will provision international toll-free number access across multiple countries worldwide.\nWhere feasible, a single international number will cover as many countries as possible. In locations where regulations or telecom limitations prevent the use of the same number, alternate toll-free numbers will be arranged.\nThe calls will originate from multiple countries and terminate within India at the Passport Seva Contact Centres. The entire cost of the calls will be borne by the Ministry of External Affairs. Under no circumstances will any charge be passed on to the caller. That commitment is central to the design of the service.\nBehind the scenes, the system will be built for reliability and scale. The service provider will be required to ensure round-the-clock availability—24 hours a day, seven days a week, all year long. Passport emergencies do not follow office hours, and neither will this helpline.\nThe connectivity will be SIP-based, beginning with a minimum capacity of 40 concurrent calls, with the ability to scale up as demand grows. Redundancy mechanisms, disaster recovery systems, and failover processes will be built in to prevent service interruptions. Real-time monitoring dashboards and detailed Call Detail Records will enable oversight and performance tracking.\nCompliance will also be critical. The service must adhere to all applicable telecom regulations in India, including guidelines issued by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India and the Department of Telecommunications, as well as regulations in the originating countries. The system must be secure, legally compliant, and operationally robust.\nTo identify the right partner, the ministry has issued a Request for Proposal inviting sealed bids from eligible telecommunications operators. The selected bidder will enter into a formal agreement with the ministry, governed by a master service agreement that outlines technical standards, service level commitments, and operational expectations.\nAt its core, this initiative is about something simple yet powerful—reassurance.\nFor Indians abroad, navigating bureaucratic systems across time zones can feel overwhelming. While embassies and consulates continue to provide vital on-ground support, many routine queries can be resolved through a responsive contact centre.\nThe international toll-free number will ensure that geography is no longer a barrier to that connection.\nThis also reflects the evolution of governance in India. The Passport Seva Programme has already digitised applications, appointments, and tracking systems. Adding a global toll-free helpline extends that digital backbone into the realm of voice support, blending technology with human interaction.\nFor the ministry, this is not merely a telecom procurement exercise. It is a step toward strengthening trust with the Indian diaspora. It signals that whether a citizen is in Delhi, Dubai, Durban, or Dublin, help is only a phone call away—and that call will not cost them anything.\nA passport may be issued in India, but its importance travels the world. With this initiative, so will access to support.\nThis move is part of India’s broader journey into digital governance. Over the past decade, the government has steadily expanded e-governance initiatives under the National e-Governance Plan. Several high-impact services were identified as mission-mode projects, and passport reform became one of the most significant among them. The goal was clear: make passport services faster, more transparent, and more citizen-friendly.\nOver the years, this structure has transformed passport delivery within India. Now the focus is expanding outward—towards Indians living overseas.\nThe Passport Seva Project was launched in June 2012 to modernise the way passports are processed and delivered. Today, passport services are managed through an extensive network that includes 37 Passport Offices, 92 Passport Seva Kendras, 452 Post Office Passport Seva Kendras, and more than 200 Indian Missions and Posts abroad.\nThe system operates in a public-private partnership model with Tata Consultancy Services, while the sovereign functions—verification, granting, and issuance of passports—remain firmly with the Ministry of External Affairs. The ownership of data and strategic control also stays with the government.\nLatest Blogs",

This semiconductor unit will give new recognition to the state. Moreover, it will boost employment, as the establishment of a semiconductor facility attracts ancillary industries, which will ultimately generate more jobs,\" Modi said in a virtual address.\nTaiwan’s Foxconn and India’s HCL Group formed a joint venture, called India Chip Private Limited, to set up an Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly & Test (OSAT) facility at YEIDA (Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority) in Greater Noida. The advanced facility is expected to be operational by 2028.\nIn his address, PM Modi said a weak supply chain of tiny chips during the Covid-19 pandemic halted development of several economies and stopped work at various factories. “Developed India will be built only when India is self-reliant. For this, Made in India chip is very important. Whatever India is doing in the field of technology in this decade, it will become foundation of our capability in the 21st century,\" Modi said.\nThe establishment of the HCL-Foxconn semiconductor facility in Uttar Pradesh is a step towards technological self-reliance. It will boost India’s presence in the global chip ecosystem.https://t.co/DNY4D9MDUz— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) February 21, 2026\nThe Prime Minister also said four semiconductor units, out of the ten approved under the India Semiconductor Mission, are set to begin production in the country. “If India’s chips are made in India, we will not have to rely on others for the tech manufacturing needs. Digital India, semiconductor chips, EVs, 5G, and AI are the soul of everyday needs. If we have chips of our own, our progress in every sector will remain unimpeded,\" he said.\nHCL Group has earmarked an investment of Rs 3,700 crore over the next few years in the facility that will produce display driver chips. The investment is expected to create over 3,500 direct and indirect jobs, build local supply chains, and attract ecosystem partners across the semiconductor value chain.\nUP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Union IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw were also present on the occasion. They were joined by Roshni Nadar Malhotra, chairperson, HCL Group, and Bob Chen, president (semiconductor business group), Hon Hai Technology Group (Foxconn).\n“In the last 11 years, the Prime Minister has established India as a powerhouse of electronics manufacturing. India is now ranked third among nations that export electronics. In a month, 3.6 crore chips will be produced from this plant. The brain of the digital screens that you see will now be made in Jewar,\" Union Electronics and IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said.\nHCL Group Chairperson Roshni Nadar said the joint venture facility will cater to the requirements of both domestic and international markets. Bob Chen also addressed the event, saying, “We want to establish reliable semiconductor assembly and testing facility in India. We look forward to growing together and contributing to India’s growth in global technology landscape.\"\n(with inputs from PTI)\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "In its first response to the US Supreme Court’s verdict to strike down the reciprocal tariffs imposed by Donald Trump, the Central government of India said it is studying all developments, from the court’s judgment to Trump’s following remarks, to analyse their implications.\n“We have noted the US Supreme Court judgement on tariffs yesterday. President Trump has also addressed a press conference in that regard. Some steps have been announced by the US Administration. We are studying all these developments for their implications,\" the Ministry of Commerce wrote in an official statement.\nThis came after the US Supreme Court dealt a major blow to the Trump administration by ruling that it did not have the legal authority to impose sweeping global tariffs under emergency powers. Earlier today, Union Minister Prahlad Joshi on Saturday said the Centre will examine the ruling and either the Commerce Ministry or the Ministry of External Affairs will officially react to it.\nIn a 6–3 decision, the court said the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not give a president the power to introduce broad, across-the-board tariffs on imports. The judgment could open the door to refund claims potentially worth tens of billions of dollars.\nUS-India Trade Deal\nWithin hours of the ruling, Trump appeared before reporters and announced a new round of tariffs, signalling that his trade agenda would move forward despite the setback. The president declared a fresh 10 per cent global tariff to be added on top of existing duties.\nTrump also said the existing trade framework with India will continue unchanged. Responding to a question about whether the trade deal or framework with India would still stand, Trump said, “Nothing changes. They will be paying tariffs. And we will not be paying tariffs. This is a reversal for what it used to be.\"\nReferring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Trump said, “India, Prime Minister Modi is a great man, but he was much smarter than the people he was against in terms of the United States. He was ripping us off.\"\nThis came after an interim trade deal between India and the US was announced this month, which reduced US tariffs on Indian imports from 50% to 18% in exchange for Delhi’s promise to stop buying Russian oil.\nHowever, after the Supreme Court verdict, a White House official said that Trump’s sweeping new 10% global tariff will reset rates for all major trading partners, including India. “This is, however, only temporary as the administration will be pursuing other legal authorities to implement more appropriate or pre-negotiated tariff rates,\" the official told AFP.\nA three-day meeting between Indian and American officials to finalise the legal text for an interim trade agreement will begin in the US on February 23, an official told PTI. The Indian team will be headed by chief negotiator Darpan Jain, who is a joint secretary in the Commerce Ministry.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "Against this backdrop, CNN-News18 spoke with Luciana Santos, Brazil’s Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, who explained why Brazil sees India not just as a partner, but as a co-shaper of a more inclusive AI order, one where innovation is guided by public interest, democratic governance, and the realities of the Global South, rather than dominated by a few powerful players.\n\nA post shared by Luciana Santos (@lucianasantos)\nEdited Excerpts:\nBrazil often speaks of AI as a tool for social inclusion, yet large parts of the Global South remain data-poor and compute-poor. How does Brazil realistically prevent AI from deepening inequality rather than reducing it?\nThe risk that artificial intelligence could deepen inequality is real, especially when much of the Global South still faces structural gaps in data availability, computing infrastructure, and skilled human capital. Brazil’s response is to treat AI not just as a technology push, but as a national development project rooted in social inclusion and digital sovereignty.\nThat approach underpins Brazil’s AI Plan 2024-2028, backed by $23 billion reais (about $4.4 billion) in public investment, with nearly 30 per cent already deployed. The focus is on tackling, at scale, the structural drivers of inequality.\nFrom building cutting-edge, renewable-powered supercomputing infrastructure to developing Portuguese-language AI models trained on Brazil’s own diverse data, the aim is to reduce external dependence and avoid imported biases.\nEqually central is large-scale training and reskilling, alongside the strategic use of AI in public services to improve delivery, especially in social sectors.\nBrazil believes that inclusion will not come automatically from innovation. It must be designed through public investment, local capacity-building, and democratic governance, so that the gains from AI are shared broadly, not concentrated in a few regions.\nIndia is positioning itself as an AI bridge between the West and the Global South. Does Brazil see India as a genuine partner in shaping alternative AI models, or is the Global South still largely reacting to rules set elsewhere?\nBrazil clearly sees India as a strategic partner. As major democracies of the Global South facing similar structural challenges, both countries share a responsibility to steer scientific and technological progress toward the public good.\nRather than simply adapting to rules set elsewhere, Brazil and India are well placed to shape their own agenda, grounded in democracy, sustainable development, and social inclusion.\nThis is already taking shape through partnerships between Brazilian and Indian AI centres, including a pilot project on secure, privacy-preserving cross-border data collaboration for medical AI. Using India’s Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture, AI models can be trained without raw data ever leaving the sovereign control of data providers.\nStronger cooperation also boosts our collective voice in global AI governance debates, pushing for frameworks that reflect the realities of the Global South, not just the priorities of major tech powers.\nThat is why summits like this one on AI’s global impact matter. They generate political momentum to democratise access to AI and accelerate its development across the Global South.\nSo, the Global South need not be reactive. Deeper strategic cooperation strengthens our ability to propose, negotiate, and build a more balanced and inclusive international AI governance.\nBrazil has taken a tougher regulatory stance on Big Tech than many emerging economies. Do you worry that stricter AI regulation could slow innovation, or do you believe unchecked innovation is the bigger risk right now?\nWe start from a simple premise: the real question is not whether to regulate or innovate, but how to regulate in a way that enables sustainable and trustworthy innovation.\nAs AI becomes more widespread, the need for strong governance has grown. Clear rules are essential to guide the development, deployment, and use of AI in a safe, ethical, and transparent manner, so its benefits truly serve society. Without them, risks such as algorithmic discrimination or violations of fundamental rights can erode public trust and, over time, undermine innovation itself.\nBrazil has therefore sought a balanced approach. Its AI Bill, approved by the Senate in December 2024 and now before the Chamber of Deputies, adopts a risk-based framework that prioritises users’ rights and participatory governance. Stricter obligations are focused on high-risk systems, while lower-risk applications are spared unnecessary burdens, preserving space for experimentation and new entrants.\nTo reinforce this framework, a complementary bill sent in December 2025 proposes the creation of a National System for the Development, Regulation, and Governance of AI, along with a Brazilian AI Council. By bringing together the National Data Protection Authority and key regulators, the model aims to deliver coordination, predictability, and regulatory clarity, all essential for investment and innovation.\nMuch of Brazil’s AI ecosystem still relies on foreign cloud infrastructure and imported chips. Can Brazil claim AI sovereignty without control over critical compute and semiconductors, and what lessons does it draw from India’s struggles on chip manufacturing?\nAcross the world, countries are increasingly debating what digital sovereignty means in their own national contexts. One widely shared view defines it as the ability to understand how digital technologies work, to develop them, and to regulate them effectively.\nFrom this perspective, sovereignty is not built through isolation, but through stronger technological autonomy achieved via openness, cooperation, and domestic capacity-building. In this context, India emerges as a strategic partner for Brazil, expanding opportunities for technology exchange, joint innovation, and solutions aligned with national priorities, especially in semiconductors, artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, the Internet of Things, blockchain, and advanced communications such as 5G and 6G.\nBrazil is also taking a strategic approach to strengthening its semiconductor ecosystem, focusing on scientific development, skills training, and deeper integration into global value chains through robust workforce programmes and incentives to expand the semiconductor supply chain.\nAt the same time, under Brazil’s AI Plan, the country is building a national public-sector data infrastructure, including sovereign cloud systems developed through partnerships between public data companies and multiple cloud providers. These arrangements are designed to ensure digital sovereignty, transparency, control, trust, and cybersecurity.\nAs BRICS expands its focus on technology cooperation, do you see scope for a BRICS-led AI framework that challenges Western-dominated governance models, or are internal differences too wide to bridge?\nBrazil is an active participant in several multilateral forums on AI governance, consistently stressing the need to promote AI for the benefit of all people, nations, living beings, and the planet. This approach is multi-stakeholder by design, bringing together governments, the private sector, academia, and civil society.\nWithin BRICS, member countries have advanced this vision through debates and conferences aimed at building consensus while respecting each country’s diversity and specific national realities.\nDuring Brazil’s BRICS presidency, the bloc discussed and adopted a declaration on AI governance and principles for the use of artificial intelligence, clearly outlining areas of shared interest. Brazil’s leadership marked an important step toward consensus-building and laid the groundwork for deeper discussions within BRICS going forward.\nFinally, from your perspective at the summit, what has been the most encouraging moment you’ve witnessed here—and what is the most uncomfortable truth about the Global South’s AI ambitions that leaders are still reluctant to admit?\nI find it encouraging to see the Global South leading a complex process such as an AI summit and agenda. This is not only possible, it is necessary. Yet we still remain heavily dependent on platforms, models, and infrastructure controlled by a handful of countries and companies.\nWithout strategic cooperation, long-term investment, and collective negotiation, there is a real risk of reproducing in AI the same technological inequalities of the past. When a few actors control algorithms and digital infrastructure, this is no longer innovation, it is domination.\nDeveloping countries cannot remain mere consumers of technology. They must build their own capabilities through technology transfer, talent development, and sovereign infrastructure.\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "New Government, New Start? Dhaka Ends Visa Freeze, Moves To Stabilise Ties With India | Exclusive",
        "content": "In a significant diplomatic development, Bangladesh has fully resumed all visa and consular services at its missions in India, ending a nearly two-month suspension that had marked a low point in bilateral ties.\nThe resumption, effective February 20, applies to all categories, including tourist, medical, business, work and other visas, at Bangladesh’s missions in New Delhi, Agartala and Siliguri. All services had previously been restricted or suspended amid a diplomatic standoff.\nThe move comes just three days after Tarique Rahman was sworn in as prime minister of Bangladesh on February 17, following his party’s decisive electoral victory. Government sources described the decision as one of the new administration’s first major foreign policy steps aimed at stabilising relations with India.\nEnd Of A Two-Month Standoff\nVisa operations had been partially suspended since December 2025 during the interim administration led by Muhammad Yunus, as ties between the two neighbours grew strained. The freeze affected travel for thousands of people, including patients seeking medical treatment, students, businesspersons and families with cross-border ties.\nDiplomatic observers had described the suspension as one of the most visible signs of deteriorating relations between New Delhi and Dhaka in recent years.\nWith the full restoration of services, Bangladeshi missions in India have resumed processing all pending and fresh applications across categories.\nA Deliberate Diplomatic Signal\nTop government sources indicated that the move is being viewed as a deliberate outreach from the new BNP-led government under Rahman to reset ties with New Delhi after the uncertainty of the interim phase.\n“This is among the first tangible foreign policy decisions of the new government,\" a senior official said, adding that normalising mobility and people-to-people contact was a priority.\nThe development also follows reciprocal signals from India. A senior consular representative confirmed that New Delhi is taking steps to fully restore visa services for Bangladeshi nationals in Bangladesh as well.\nPolitical Shift and What’s Next\nRahman’s swearing-in marks a major political shift in Bangladesh, ending the interim period and ushering in a government with a strong parliamentary majority. Analysts say early diplomatic gestures such as restoring visa services are aimed at reassuring regional partners of policy continuity and stability.\nIndia, for its part, is understood to be keen on rebuilding momentum in the relationship. Officials are awaiting Rahman’s response to an invitation from Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a visit to India—a potential next step in recalibrating bilateral engagement.\nFor now, the reopening of visa services is being seen as a practical and symbolic reset, signalling that after weeks of uncertainty, the two neighbours may be moving toward a more stable phase in their relationship.\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "Chinese Robodog Failure Highlights Galgotias’ Large AI Summit Booth: ‘Bigger Than 4 IITs’ — How Much Did It Cost?",
        "content": "When visitors walked into Hall 6 at Bharat Mandapam during the AI Impact Summit 2026 in New Delhi, one pavilion stood out for its sheer size. Galgotias University, a private institution based in Noida, had a 155-square-metre booth, quite larger than the combined space allotted to several Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs).\nThe development drew attention online, especially after the university was embroiled in the robodog controversy at the same event.\nWhat Happened With The Robodog\nGalgotias University faced backlash after a robotic dog displayed at its stall was presented as an in-house innovation developed by its Centre of Excellence. The robot was later identified as the Unitree Go2, a commercially available quadruped developed by China-based Unitree Robotics.\nThe product is sold globally and is not an original invention. The claim triggered criticism and raised concerns about due diligence at a government-backed event. Following the controversy, the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) reportedly asked the university to vacate its stall.\nThe Booth Size In Limelight\nAfter the robodog episode, attention turned to pavilion sizes at the summit. According to a floor plan obtained by The Indian Express from organisers, Galgotias University was allotted 155 square metres in Hall 6.\nIn comparison, four IITs and one research foundation together received 130 square metres. The breakup was as follows:\nIIT Bombay – 35 sqm\nIIT Madras – 35 sqm\nIIT Kharagpur – 24 sqm\nIIT Gandhinagar – 18 sqm\nAirawat Research Foundation at IIT Kanpur – 18 sqm\nCollectively, these institutions, though widely regarded as India’s best engineering and research bodies, had less exhibition space than Galgotias alone. The comparison fuelled online debate over how space was allocated at a summit positioned as a showcase of India’s AI ecosystem.\nHere’s What Social Media Said\nJoining in the debate, a user posted on X, “IITs may have thought that their degree and research is enough, but the Galgotia people understood ‘first-come-first-served’ as ‘come first, take all possession’. IIT had 130 sqm of research, so Galgotia had a swag of 155 sqm! It is called – knowledge will decrease, but the shop should be big.\"\nIITs may have thought that their degree and research is enough, but the Galgotia people understood ‘first-come-first-served’ as ‘come first, take all possession’.

It is called – knowledge will decrease, but the shop…— Kᴀᴘɪʟ Gᴏᴜʀ (@GaurBulandshahr) February 20, 2026\n\nAnother simply wrote, “The space given to Galgotias for the AI summit for larger than the space given to 4 IITs combined..\"\nSomeone else said, “They paid more I’d assume? Booth size is always decided by financial contribution!\"\nThe space given to Galgotias for the AI summit for larger than the space given to 4 IITs combined. pic.twitter.com/k5ZBXHveXo— Cooper (@Akshaykpr) February 20, 2026\n\nHow Was Space Allocated\nThe exhibition space at Bharat Mandapam was reportedly leased on a first-come, first-served basis. Allocation was handled by the Software Technology Parks of India (STPI), an autonomous body under the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY).\nAccording to an organiser cited by The Indian Express, kiosk space was allotted based on demand. Institutions that applied earlier and requested larger areas could secure more space. There was no formal vetting process tied to research output, institutional ranking or contribution to India’s AI ecosystem.\nHow Much Did Galgotias Pay\nThe rate for academic institutions was fixed at Rs 9,000 per square metre.\nWith 155 square metres allotted, Galgotias University paid approximately ₹14 lakh (excluding taxes and electricity connection charges). Institutions with smaller booths paid proportionately less, based on the space they secured.\nSince the pricing was uniform per square metre, the difference in booth size directly translated into a higher payment.\nWhy The Issue Gained Attention\nThe AI Impact Summit was positioned as a platform to showcase India’s innovation capabilities. The presence of IITs and established research bodies was seen as central to that objective, given their long-standing contributions to AI research and technological development. Viewers questioned whether exhibition space at such events should reflect institutional credibility and contribution instead of demand and booking order.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "A Delhi court on Saturday approved a five-day police custody for the four Youth Congress workers who staged a shirtless protest at Bharat Mandapam during the AI Summit.\nWhile seeking remand, Delhi Police said that the accused had staged a protest similar to the protest in Nepal, claiming that it was a conspiracy to defame the country internationally.\nThe public prosecutor told the court that the accused shouted anti-national slogans during their protest against the India-US trade deal and wore T-shirts carrying messages against Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\nAfter being asked why the police wants 5-day custody of the accused, the investigating officer stated that there is a deep conspiracy, that other accused fled the scene, and that custody is needed for a proper investigation.\nMeanwhile, the lawyer for the accused argued that they were being singled out because of their affiliation with the opposition party and claimed that similar protests are occurring across the country. The lawyer added that political dissent shouldn’t be crushed like this.\nThe arrested men, Krishna Hari, Kundan Yadav, Ajay Kumar, and Narasimha Yadav, were brought to Patiala House Court earlier in the day.\nTheir lawyer contended that they are members of a political party and were exercising their right to protest peacefully at Bharat Mandapam, emphasizing that there is no evidence of any violence.\nHe also said they are office bearers and educated people. The charges against them could lead to up to 7 years in prison. The public prosecutor said the accused shouted anti-national slogans and wore T-shirts with messages against Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\nMeanwhile, BJP workers staged protests in multiple states against the Congress party following the Indian Youth Congress demonstration at the India AI Impact Summit.\nIn Surat and Jammu, BJP members held demonstrations targeting Congress, while in Delhi, BJP Yuva Morcha members protested and condemned the incident.\nThe protests came after Indian Youth Congress members at the Bharat Mandapam venue in Delhi removed their shirts bearing slogans such as “Compromised PM.\"\n(With inputs from agencies)\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "In Uttar Pradesh’s Bundelkhand, the Special POCSO Court in Banda has delivered the harshest punishment under the law to a suspended junior engineer of the irrigation department and his wife. They have been sentenced to death after being found guilty of sexually\nexploiting 33 minor boys and selling their abuse videos on the dark web to buyers across the world.\nThe verdict has shocked many not only because of the disturbing scale of the crime but also because it marks the third death sentence awarded by the same court in just six months.\nWho Is The Judge Who Delivered Three Death Sentences In Six Months?\nThe latest verdict was pronounced by Special POCSO Judge Pradeep Kumar Mishra. With this judgment, he has now awarded the death penalty three times within half a year, Dainik Bhaskar reported.\nIn September 2025, in a village under Chilla police station, a minor girl was raped and murdered. The court completed the trial within 58 days after the charge sheet was filed and sentenced the accused to death.\nIn January, in a case from Kalinjar, another accused in a child rape case was also awarded capital punishment.\nLast year, a rape convict was sentenced to death in Marka. In the Chhota Purwa massacre case where two children were killed, the accused was also given the death penalty.\nSo far, five death sentences have been pronounced in Banda district, the report mentioned. But in older cases, the convicts’ families have filed appeals in the High Court and those matters are currently under consideration.\nWhat Is The Latest Case Of The Junior Engineer And His Wife?\nOn Friday, the POCSO court ordered that Ram Bhavan, a junior engineer posted in Chitrakoot, and his wife Durgawati be “hanged till death.\" The couple had been convicted on February 18 after a detailed trial based on digital evidence, medical reports and testimonies\nfrom dozens of witnesses.\nThe court observed that the crime fell within the “rarest of rare\" category due to its brutality, long duration, systematic planning and international ramifications.\nHow Did The Case Begin?\nThe case began in October 2020 when the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) received inputs from INTERPOL about child sexual abuse material linked to an Indian phone number. Acting on this information, the CBI registered an FIR on October 31, 2020.\nRam Bhavan was arrested on November 17, 2020. His wife Durgawati was also taken into custody after investigators found evidence of her involvement.\nThe couple reportedly targeted children from economically weaker families in Banda, Chitrakoot and nearby districts. They lured minors aged between 5 and 16 years by offering gifts and inducements. Once the children were brought home, they were sexually assaulted.\nThe acts were recorded using a laptop camera and mobile phones.\nThe videos and photographs were later uploaded and sold on the dark web to international buyers.\nWhat Did The Digital Investigation Reveal?\nThe CBI recovered a pen drive that contained 34 videos and 679 photographs of minors. After digital forensic analysis, it was found that the material was directly linked to the accused.\nIt was also found that the content was shared with buyers in 47 countries such as China, US, Brazil and Afghanistan.\nThe charge sheet ran into nearly 700 pages and was filed 88 days after the arrests. It included medical examination reports, victim statements, witness testimonies and digital evidence tracing the online distribution network.\n74 witnesses were examined during the trial which included child victims, doctors from AIIMS Delhi, teachers and other witnesses.\nWhat Role Did The Wife Play In The Crime?\nThe court held Durgawati equally responsible. Evidence showed that she actively participated in the exploitation and helped lure children by offering expensive gifts and bringing them into the house.\nThe prosecution also stated that she attempted to influence witnesses and facilitate compromise during the investigation.\nThe court noted that the involvement of both adults in the household deepened the psychological trauma suffered by the children and showed a calculated and sustained pattern of abuse.\nHow Were Children Trapped For Years Without Suspicion?\nRam Bhavan kept a separate mobile phone at home specifically for children. Despite having no children of his own, he used this device to attract neighbourhood minors. Some children admitted that they had visited his house to watch YouTube videos, Navbharat\nTimes reported.\nHe managed to hide his crimes for years due to his polite and simple behaviour. At the time of his arrest, then Chitrakoot SP Ankit Mittal stated that no prior complaint of such nature had ever been received.\nOriginally from Devinka Purwa in Kharaunch village, Ram Bhavan lived in rented houses in Karvi. His brothers resided in the Naraini Atarra Road area. Colleagues described him as soft-spoken and courteous which made it difficult to suspect him.\nHe never applied for government accommodation and instead lived in rented houses. In Sikri village, he rented a house from Kakkoo Singh but had to vacate it within one and a half months after neighbours complained about suspicious activities.\nAt the time of arrest, he was associated with the Arjun Sahayak Project in Mahoba and the Rasin Dam project in Chitrakoot. He was living in a rented house behind the SDM office.\nWhat Did The Court Say About The Impact On Victims?\nWhile delivering the sentence, Judge Pradeep Kumar Mishra described the acts as extremely heinous and said they struck at the foundation of societal morality and child safety.\nDuring the trial, doctors from AIIMS Delhi testified that several children suffered severe physical and psychological trauma. Some had injuries to delicate body parts and required medical treatment in Delhi. The brutality disturbed even the medical team.\nThe court observed that because of the torture, many children’s lives had turned into a living nightmare.\nRecognising the long-term trauma, the court directed the District Magistrate to ensure that each identified victim receives Rs 10 lakh as compensation for rehabilitation and medical support.\nHow Does This Case Echo The Scandal Surrounding Jeffrey Epstein?\nNavbharat Times also compared the case with American financier Jeffrey Epstein who was later exposed as a convicted sex offender running a large child sex trafficking network for years.\nHe was first arrested on July 27, 2006, in Florida in a case related to soliciting a minor for prostitution. Years later, on July 6, 2019, he was taken into custody again, this time facing federal charges of sex trafficking that involved underage girls.\nEven after his death, the controversy surrounding him has not faded. He was found dead in his Manhattan jail cell on August 10, 2019, in what authorities ruled a suicide while he was awaiting trial. The subsequent release of a vast collection of official records,\nwidely referred to as the “Epstein Files,\" has kept him at the center of international legal and political debate.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "How did a junior engineer posted in Uttar Pradesh’s irrigation department turn into the kingpin of an international child sexual abuse racket? The answer emerged in a Banda courtroom on Friday, where a POCSO court, in one of the most disturbing child sexual abuse case, awarded the death penalty to Ram Bhavan and his wife Durgawati for sexually exploiting minors and selling their videos on the dark web to international buyers.\nThe convicts — Rambhavan, a junior engineer in the irrigation department posted in Chitrakoot, and his wife Durgavati — were ordered to be “hanged till death\" by Special POCSO Judge Pradeep Kumar Mishra.\nThe court observed that the crime fell within the “rarest of rare\" category due to its brutality, premeditation, and international ramifications.\nThe couple had been convicted on February 18 following a lengthy trial based on digital evidence, medical reports, and testimonies of multiple victims.\nALSO READ: POCSO Victims Nearly Double In 7 Years As Sexual Offences Against Kids Rise Faster Than Overall Crime\nHow The Case Began\nThe case dates back to October 2020, when the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) received inputs from INTERPOL regarding the circulation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) linked to an Indian phone number. Acting on this intelligence, the CBI registered an FIR on October 31, 2020.\nOn November 17, 2020, Rambhavan was arrested. His wife Durgavati was also taken into custody after investigators found evidence of her involvement. According to the prosecution, the couple targeted children from economically weaker backgrounds in Banda, Chitrakoot, and surrounding districts.\nThey allegedly lured minors aged between 5 and 16 years with inducements and gifts. The court was told that the children were sexually assaulted and the acts were recorded using a laptop camera and mobile devices. These videos and photographs were then uploaded and distributed through the dark web to international networks.\nDigital Trail And Evidence\nDuring the investigation, the CBI recovered a pen drive containing 34 videos and 679 photographs of minors. Digital forensic analysis linked the content directly to the accused. Investigators also found that the material had been shared with buyers in 47 countries, including China, the United States, Brazil, and Afghanistan.\nThe charge sheet, running into nearly 700 pages, was filed 88 days after the arrests. It included medical examination reports of the victims, statements from children and witnesses, and digital evidence establishing the online distribution network.\nIn total, 74 witnesses were examined during the trial. The CBI recorded statements from individuals aged between 4 and 42 years to build a comprehensive case.\nAdvocate Kamal Singh, associated with the POCSO court proceedings, said the case was initiated after international intelligence inputs flagged suspicious online activity.\n“The investigation revealed a systematic pattern of abuse and online dissemination. The digital evidence was crucial in securing the conviction,\" he said.\nALSO READ: ‘Survivors Of Child Abuse Not To Be Re-Traumatised’: SC Rejects Convict’s Plea In POCSO Case\nRole Of Wife And Attempt To Influence Witnesses\nWhile Rambhavan was found directly involved in the sexual assaults and recording of videos, Durgavati was also held equally responsible. The court noted that she not only participated in the exploitation but also attempted to pressure witnesses and facilitate compromise efforts during the investigation.\nThe prosecution said that the involvement of both parents-like figures in such crimes deepened the psychological trauma of the victims and demonstrated a calculated and sustained pattern of abuse.\nCourt’s Observations\nPronouncing the sentence, Judge Pradeep Kumar Mishra said the offence was extremely heinous and had a far-reaching impact on society.\n“The acts committed by the accused are of such a grave nature that they strike at the very foundation of societal morality and the safety of children. This court finds it appropriate to award the maximum punishment,\" the judge observed.\nThe court further directed the District Magistrate to ensure that each identified victim receives Rs 10 lakh as compensation for rehabilitation and medical support. Some of the affected children reportedly underwent treatment at AIIMS, New Delhi, for physical and psychological trauma.\nLatest Blogs",

It will also examine whether decisions were taken with due diligence, proper recorded justification and procedural compliance.\nALSO READ: Tirupati Laddu Row: Probe Finds No Action Was Taken Despite Ghee Adulteration Report In 2022\nThe panel has also been asked to identify the extent of administrative responsibility, if any, of officers, committee members or TTD functionaries in relation to the lapses flagged in the SIT report, and recommend appropriate administrative or disciplinary action.\nThe government has made it clear that the committee’s examination will be confined strictly to administrative and governance aspects.\nThe move comes after the state Cabinet, in its last meeting, announced that a separate panel would be set up to examine the SIT report. The latest order formally gives effect to that decision.\nThe government order refers to the FIR/ Crime No. 470/2024 was registered at Tirupati East Police Station over the alleged supply of adulterated and sub-standard ghee to TTD.\nIt also references the Supreme Court, through its October 4, 2024 order in W.P.(C) No. 622/2024 where it entrusted the investigation to an independent SIT functioning under the supervision of the Director of the Central Bureau of Investigation.\nAfter completing the investigation, the SIT filed its charge sheet before the court on January 23, 2026. Along with this, it submitted a self-contained note recommending that suitable action be initiated against committee members and senior TTD officers for lapses, omissions and failures in both relaxing and enforcing ghee tender conditions.\nIt is based on these findings that the government has now constituted the one-man committee.\nThe committee has been given the power to call for records, seek written clarifications and obtain expert assistance, subject to prior government approval. It has been directed to submit its report within 45 days from the date of the order.\nThe Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams will provide the necessary secretariat assistance to the panel.\nThe government has also clarified that the report will be recommendatory in nature and will be examined before any further action is taken.\nLatest Blogs",

Our position on this issue was most recently expressed in the India-Arab League Ministerial Joint statement,\" said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal during a press briefing.\nJaiswal was referring to the India-Arab Foreign Ministers’ meeting last month, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi reiterated India’s continued support for the people of Palestine and welcomed ongoing peace efforts, including the Gaza peace plan.\n“‘Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to achieving a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace in the Middle East, according to international law, relevant UN resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative. They called for a sovereign, independent and viable State of Palestine based on 1967 borders, living side by side in peace with Israel. Both parties supported the practice of inalienable rights of the Palestinian people,\" read a joint statement issued by India and Arab countries.\nThe MEA clarified that India has associated itself with the initiative, keeping in mind the concerns addressed by the statement.\nIsrael’s West Bank Plans\nAt least 100 countries, including Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, the League of Arab States, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the European Union, signed the statement condemning Israel’s plans for the annexation of the West Bank.\nThe joint statement said, “We strongly condemn unilateral Israeli decisions and measures aimed at expanding Israel’s unlawful presence in the West Bank. Such decisions are contrary to Israel’s obligations under international law and must be immediately reversed.\"\nIt underlined strong opposition to any form of annexation and rejected all measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem.\nThis came after Israel’s cabinet on Sunday approved further measures to tighten Israel’s control over the occupied West Bank and make it easier for settlers to buy land. Palestinians termed this move “de-facto annexation.\" The foreign ministry said the measure would promote transparency and help resolve land disputes.\nThe West Bank is among the territories that Palestinians seek for a future independent state.

        "content": "A political controversy has erupted in Karnataka after Public Works Minister Satish Jarkiholi acknowledged that the practice of “commissions\" or kickbacks continues within the state’s governance system.\nThe minister’s remarks come amid mounting tensions with the Karnataka State Contractors Association (KSCA) announcing a statewide protest on March 6, alleging that the government has failed to clear pending bills amounting to ₹37,370 crore.\nThe association has accused the Congress-led government of presiding over worsening corruption and administrative paralysis, intensifying the political heat around infrastructure projects.\n\n\nResponding to questions on allegations of commission-taking in the Public Works Department (PWD), Jarkiholi made an unusually candid statement.\n“That’s there. It was there before. It’s there now. It will be there in future. It’s difficult to trace where exactly it happens. Allegations keep coming from different sides. It existed earlier, it exists today, and it may exist tomorrow as well. But it has to be controlled. We must put an end to it,\" the minister said.\nThe comments have triggered sharp political reactions, particularly because the Congress swept to power in 2023 after targeting the previous BJP government over the alleged “40 per cent commission\" culture in public works.\nJarkiholi’s statement is being viewed by critics as an implicit admission that illegal payments and systemic corruption remain deeply entrenched within sections of the bureaucracy, despite the government’s promises of reform and transparency.\n\n\nThe controversy has gained further traction with contractors warning of a deepening financial crisis due to unpaid dues. The KSCA claims that prolonged delays in payments have pushed many contractors to the brink, stalling development works across the state.\nThe March 6 protest is expected to intensify pressure on the Congress administration to urgently clear bills and restore confidence within the infrastructure sector.\nThe issue is politically sensitive for Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, whose government had projected itself as a clean and accountable alternative to the previous regime.\n\n\nThe opposition Bharatiya Janata Party seized on the minister’s remarks to mount a fierce attack on the government. Leader of Opposition R Ashoka accused the Congress of hypocrisy, alleging that corruption remains central to its governance.\n“He has admitted this because he is also corrupt. Corruption has been there since independence and its foundation was laid by the Congress. This is a shame for the Congress government. The minister has openly accepted that the party is corrupt,\" Ashoka alleged.\nLatest Blogs",

The charge for passenger vehicles with 12+1 seating capacity has been raised from Rs 110 to Rs 170. Mini buses with 32 seats will now pay Rs 320, up from Rs 180, while commercial buses will be charged Rs 600 compared to the earlier Rs 320. Entry fees for construction machinery have been increased from Rs 570 to Rs 800, and large goods vehicles will now pay Rs 900 instead of Rs 720. Tractor entry fees have also been revised upward, from Rs 70 to Rs 100.\nHowever, the rate for double-axle bus-trucks remains unchanged at Rs 570.\nLocal Himachal Pradesh-registered vehicles will continue to be exempt.\nThe entry fee revision is part of a broader effort by the Congress government led by Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu to strengthen state finances amid mounting fiscal pressure. Special committees headed by district collectors have been formed to implement the new rates and manage barrier operations at key entry points including Parwanoo and Baddi in Solan, Mahatpur in Una, Kandwal in Kangra, Garamaura in Bilaspur and Govindghat in Sirmaur.\nLatest Blogs",

There have been some glitches, but these things happen in a large event. What has been impressive is the attendance of Presidents, Prime Ministers, and world leaders, and they’ve come with a strong message of wanting to see a newly integrated world in AI development, where the impact upon society would be the Principle. Preoccupation in India has clearly led the drive in this area. As far as the French Rafale is concerned, parts of it are being manufactured in India, and that is a very important aspect of the deal because it is part of strengthening our defence, but also increasing our self-reliance in the defence sector… Defence is important for India not because we want to go to war, but because we don’t want others to think that we are so weak that they can be tempted to go to war. It is a defensive defence literally, and I support the government on that.”\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "An immigration officer has allegedly lost Rs 79 lakh after falling victim to a sophisticated cryptocurrency investment fraud, police said on Thursday.\nThe 41-year-old officer working at Malaysia’s consulate general office in Mumbai, approached the police authorities around one-and-a-half years after the incident, citing severe mental stress and fear of social stigma, officials from the East Region Cyber Police said.\nAn official said that in January 2024, the officer was added to a WhatsApp group called “EG Plan,\" where members frequently shared updates and tips related to share trading. Having a basic understanding of the stock market, he found the content credible. Following the group’s guidance, he signed up on a company website and started investing.\nOver time, he transferred funds through online transactions and RTGS to more than 18 different bank accounts. In the beginning, he received returns of Rs 1.69 lakh, which boosted his confidence in the scheme.\nEncouraged by the initial payout, he went on to invest around Rs 78.85 lakh between April 2024 and June 2025, believing he was putting the money into cryptocurrency trading, the official added.\nWhen he attempted to withdraw his investment and profits, the fraudsters allegedly demanded an additional Rs 18 lakh as “processing fee\". But after he refused to pay, all the communication was cut off.\nHe later informed his bank, which advised him to approach the police.\nFollowing his complaint, police registered a case against 10 unidentified persons under charges of criminal conspiracy and cheating, along with relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act.\nPolice are currently tracing the bank accounts where the funds were transferred and identifying the account holders, the official said, adding that investigation was underway.\n(With inputs from PTI)\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "RSS Affiliate Laghu Udyog Bharati Urges Govt To Drop Blue Line Plan For Antimicrobial Drugs",
        "content": "A month after the central government mandated marking antimicrobial drugs with a conspicuous blue vertical line, RSS-affiliated Laghu Udyog Bharati (LUB) has urged the health ministry not to proceed with the final notification, arguing that the move would impose heavy economic and environmental costs without meaningfully addressing antimicrobial misuse.\nIn a letter dated February 18, seen by News18, LUB has requested the government “to reconsider the proposed amendment under global prospective and consider our above factful submission and do not go for final notification\".\nLUB is an all-India organisation representing micro and small enterprises (MSMEs) and claims to represent over 64,000 members across the country.\nThe blue line proposal was introduced through draft notification in January, proposing an amendment to Rule 96 of the Drugs Rules, 1945, to mandate “a conspicuous blue vertical strip on the labels of antimicrobial drugs\".\nAntimicrobial drugs include antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals and antiparasitic medicines used to treat infections caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites. India has been grappling with rising antimicrobial resistance (AMR), largely driven by irrational use, self-medication and over-the-counter availability of antibiotics despite prescription requirements.\nThe proposed blue line is intended to function as a clear visual identifier, reinforcing that these medicines should be used strictly under medical supervision. It builds on earlier regulatory efforts such as the red line warning introduced in 1993 and the later red box warning under Schedule H1.\nHowever, LUB argues that past visual labelling interventions have not significantly altered misuse patterns. In its letter, the organisation states, “Experience from earlier labelling interventions shows that such changes do not materially impact misuse.\" It notes that despite decades of red line and red box warnings, “irrational use and over-the-counter sale of antibiotics continue\".\nIn its representation, seen by News18, LUB contends that the amendment would require manufacturers to redesign labels, revise approved artworks and discard existing packaging material. “The proposed requirement will necessitate redesigning of labels, revision of approved artworks, and disposal of existing printed packaging material, resulting in significant financial and operational burden, particularly for MSME manufacturers,\" the letter said. It warns that sudden implementation could lead to “losses running into crores of rupees for even a single manufacturing unit\".\nThe organisation also flags environmental implications, pointing out that pharmaceutical packaging relies on pre-printed aluminium foils and specialised printing cylinders. Large-scale destruction of these materials, it said, would generate industrial waste and increase pollution. The letter cautions that repeated labelling changes would lead to “high economic and environmental costs without delivering commensurate public health benefits\".\nLUB further argues that antimicrobial drugs are already governed under Schedule H and Schedule H1 with specific labelling and prescription requirements. According to the letter, “The addition of another visual identifier, such as a blue line, may create confusion among healthcare professionals and patients rather than improving rational use.\" It also raises concerns that mandatory domestic labelling changes could disrupt export packaging and regulatory harmonisation, potentially affecting manufacturing efficiency and India’s competitiveness.\nUltimately, the organisation maintains that the core issue lies in weak enforcement at the distribution and retail level. “Antimicrobial misuse is primarily driven by weak enforcement at the distribution and retail level, where antibiotics continue to be available over the counter despite existing legal restrictions,\" the letter stated, suggesting stronger enforcement and accountability measures rather than additional visual markers.\nConcluding the letter, LUB has urged the ministry to take a broader view before proceeding, stating: “In view of the above, we humbly request the ministry to reconsider the proposed amendment under global prospective and consider our above factful submission and do not go for final notification.\"\nLatest Blogs",

Stuck for more than an hour. Due to the VVIP movement, our movement gets restricted. Nobody cares for normal people who are working hard every day,\" one commuter wrote.\nOthers reported frequent rerouting on navigation apps as roads were abruptly closed. Many advised residents to rely on the Delhi Metro instead of private vehicles during the summit period.\nThe Delhi Traffic Police had earlier issued an advisory stating that elaborate arrangements and traffic regulations were being implemented from February 16 to 20 for the smooth conduct of the AI Impact Summit at Bharat Mandapam, which is being attended by heads of state, ministers and foreign delegates.\nAccording to the advisory, traffic movement was restricted or regulated on key roads including Mathura Road, Subramania Bharti Marg, Rajesh Pilot Marg, Janpath, Firoze Shah Road, Safdarjung Road and Kartavya Path, among others. Certain stretches like Bhairon Marg and parts of Mathura Road were designated restricted zones during route movement.\n\n\nMeanwhile, in his keynote address, the former English Prime Minister called India the ideal venue for shaping the future of artificial intelligence, saying there was “no better place\" to deliberate on global AI transformation.\nPraising India’s digital public infrastructure such as Aadhaar, UPI and Ayushman Bharat Health Accounts, he said that the country was uniquely positioned to drive the next phase of AI’s global journey — not only for developed nations but also for the developing world.\nHighlighting the speed of AI adoption, he noted that while the telephone took 75 years to reach 100 million users and the internet seven years, ChatGPT reached that milestone in just two months.\nThe India AI Impact Summit 2026, the first global AI summit to be hosted in the Global South, has brought together representatives from more than 110 countries to advance discussions on AI governance, safety and inclusive growth.\n(With inputs from agencies)\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "After the recent elections in Bangladesh, intelligence agencies in India have sounded an alarm over Rohingya refugees, illegal immigration, terror networks and demographic changes in West Bengal ahead of the upcoming Assembly polls, sources told CNN-News18.\nIn an election marred by violence targeting religious minorities and widespread irregularities, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), led by former PM Khaleda Zia’s son Tarique Rahman, secured a strong mandate, winning 209 of the 299 seats, while the Jamaat-e-Islami secured 68 seats, making it the chief opposition party. Ousted PM Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League was banned from contesting the polls.\nHowever, intelligence agencies have warned that Pakistan’s ISI is colluding with the Jamaat-e-Islami and using its seats in Bangladesh’s Satkhira and Chuadanga to push illegal immigrants into West Bengal’s Nadia and Murshidabad districts, according to sources.\nAdditionally, Jamaat’s radical spread is being used to activate terror sleeper cells in North 24 Parganas to influence voter turnout during the West Bengal Assembly elections, sources said. These sleeper cells are also aiming to disrupt the elections in Malda.\nALSO READ: Mamata Banerjee Fact-Checked: What Bangladesh Election Data Shows On Minority Representation | Exclusive\nAttempts At Demographic Change In Bengal\nAccording to sources, Malda’s Muslim population is estimated at 55-60%, which is mainly due to cross-border migration and Jamaat-e-Islami’s victory in Bangladesh’s Chapainawabganj, which lies close to Bengal’s Malda and Murshidabad districts.\nAdditionally, intelligence agencies warned of attempts at demographic change and settlements of sleeper cells affiliated with terror groups with the help of Rohingya networks.\nGroups such as ARSA (Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army), RSO (Rohingya Solidarity Organisation), and JMB (Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh) are likely to coordinate their activities in Cox’s Bazar following the Bangladesh elections. This is expected to affect West Bengal’s Uttar Dinajpur district, with madrasa-linked networks in Birbhum potentially serving as key hubs.\nPakistan-China-Bangladesh Links\nIntelligence reports also pointed to links involving Pakistan and China, allegedly aimed at targeting Siliguri through the Kurigram airbase. Jamaat’s ideological infiltration into West Bengal’s borders could have potential for communal riots in Jalpaiguri and may impact voter safety and Trinamool Congress’ (TMC) hold in 2026.\nSeveral steps have been taken recently to address the issue, including the return of a large number of undocumented Bangladeshis in North 24 Parganas during the Election Commission’s Special Intensive Revision (SIR) process. BSF reported that at least 150–200 people are returning daily after verification, biometric checks and screening of criminal records.\nMigrants working as ragpickers, labourers or domestic workers, who have been living in India for more than 10 years using forged Aadhaar cards, voter IDs, and ration cards, are also returning due to fear of arrest and imprisonment linked to the SIR exercise.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "A vigilance probe into the alleged misappropriation of funds from the sale of ghee at Sabarimala has named 33 persons as accused, including Temple Special Officers and nearly 30 counter staff.\nWhile hearing the matter, the High Court expressed strong displeasure over the manner in which records were maintained. The court said it was “shocking to note the callous and casual manner in which records are maintained, and the income generated from the sale of sacred offerings is accounted for.\"\nThe judges observed that even a small shopkeeper would be expected to maintain better financial discipline. “Even a person running a modest petty shop would be expected to maintain far better accounting discipline to ensure that income and stock are properly reconciled,\" the court remarked.\nAccording to the proceedings, ghee packets were issued to counters after being recorded in notebooks informally referred to as “Kutti Books\". Separate notebooks were maintained for each counter and kept in the temple office. These books recorded the number of packets issued along with the signatures of the staff receiving them.\nInvestigating officers produced one such 200-page school notebook before the court, relating to the Maramathu-II counter. On examining it, the court noted that entries covering the period from 17 November 2025 to 30 December 2025 occupied only about 20 pages. The notebook also contained several corrections, overwriting and interlineations, which drew the court’s disapproval.\nThe court further observed that the Temple Board and its officials were expected to exercise much greater supervision, especially since the sale of offerings generates several lakhs of rupees daily.\nLatest Blogs",

Eventually, they raised clenched fists instead of holding each other’s hands like others.\nSam Altman and Dario Amodei being forced to hold hands like two toddlers who just bit each other at daycare is the absolute peak of this summit.

In 2020, Amodei, his sister Daniela Amodei, and other senior researchers departed from OpenAI due to disagreements with Altman and the board regarding the company’s direction.\nThe split reflected differing philosophies around AI safety, governance, and commercial strategy. Anthropic positions itself as a safety-focused AI lab, emphasising alignment and responsible development through its Claude model family.\nOpenAI, meanwhile, has pursued rapid product deployment alongside safety research, bringing ChatGPT and enterprise AI tools to market at scale. The companies now compete directly in foundation models, enterprise partnerships, and government engagement, with both seeking leadership in the race toward artificial general intelligence (AGI).\nLatest Blogs",

According to PTI, Ranganath said his constituency, Kunigal Taluk, is “mostly rural and depends heavily on farming\". He noted that many young men continue to live in villages and earn their livelihood through agriculture, but “many women are not willing to marry them\".\nThe MLA pointed out that several men remain unmarried even after turning 30 and are facing difficulties because of this social trend. Highlighting what he described as an urgent concern in rural areas, he wrote, “So, I request that in the next session, a special allowance and special status be given to women who marry men living in villages and working in agriculture.\"\nRanganath believes such a measure would help resolve the problems faced by young farmers in rural areas and encourage greater support for farming livelihoods. He has called for a structured discussion in the Assembly and the formulation of a policy at the earliest.\nThe proposal has triggered debate across Karnataka’s rural belt. While many see it as a positive intervention to strengthen agriculture socially and encourage young farmers, others are examining it from the perspective of social balance and economic feasibility.\nThere has been no official response yet from the Chief Minister’s office.\nThe challenge of delayed marriages among young men in agrarian communities has persisted for years in parts of the state. Whether financial incentives can reshape social attitudes remains to be seen, but the debate has once again brought the realities of rural life and agriculture into sharp focus.\nLatest Blogs",

India is not just a part of the AI revolution, but is leading and shaping it,\" he said in the presence of world leaders and CEOs of leading companies.\nThe prime minister also described AI as a historic transformation comparable to the invention of wireless communication. “When signals were first transmitted wirelessly, no one imagined that the entire world would one day be connected in real time. Artificial Intelligence is such a transformation of human history.

The new initiative is an extension of Google’s earlier announced $15 billion five-year AI investment in India, which was focused on a mega AI hub in Visakhapatnam.\nLatest Blogs",

Follow Live Updates\nAddressing the gathering at Bharat Mandapam, he said, “While some see fear in AI, others see the future. I can say with utmost pride that India finds its future in Artificial Intelligence,\" underlining the country’s forward-looking approach to the technology.\nHighlighting the rapid pace of change in the digital era, the Prime Minister said, “AI is making machines intelligent, but more than that, it is increasing human capabilities manyfold. There is only one difference: this time, the speed is unprecedented, and the scale is also unexpected. Earlier, the impact of technology used to take decades to be visible. Today, the journey from machine learning to learning machines is faster, deeper and wider than ever.\"\nAlso Read: Moral, Sovereign, Inclusive: PM Modi Unveils Human-Centric ‘MANAV’ Vision At India AI Summit\nStressing the responsibility that comes with such transformative power, Modi drew parallels with nuclear technology and urged global reflection.\n“We have to have a big vision and shoulder an equally big responsibility. Along with the present generation, we also have to worry about what form of AI we will hand over to the coming generations. Therefore, the real question today is not what Artificial Intelligence can do in the future. The question is, what do we do with Artificial Intelligence in the present? Such questions have come before humanity before. The most powerful example is nuclear power. We have seen its destruction and its positive contribution has also been seen,\" he observed.\nDesign and Develop in India.Deliver to the World.\nDeliver to Humanity. pic.twitter.com/EDXEbAsESr\n— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) February 19, 2026\nDescribing AI as a force that must be guided ethically, he said, “AI is a transformative power. If directionless, it becomes a disruption; if the right direction is found, it becomes a solution. How to make AI from machine-centric to human-centric, how to make it sensitive and responsive, this is the basic objective of this Global AI Impact Summit. The theme of this summit clearly reflects the perspective from which India views AI. Welfare of all, the happiness of all. This is our benchmark.\"\nCalling for preparedness in the evolving job landscape, the Prime Minister added, “We must make skilling, reskilling, and lifelong learning a mass movement. The future of work will be inclusive, trusted, and human-centric. If we move forward together, artificial intelligence will elevate the potential of humanity.\"\nAlso Read: AI Rivalry On Stage: OpenAI’s Altman, Anthropic’s Amodei Share Awkward Moment In Delhi Summit\nHe also advocated democratising AI to prevent dehumanisation and ensure inclusive growth. “For AI, humans are just data points. To ensure that humans are not reduced to mere raw material, AI must be democratised. It must be made a medium for inclusion and empowerment, especially in the Global South. We must give AI an open sky and also keep the command in our hands, like GPS. GPS shows us the way, but the final call on which direction we should go is ours. The direction in which we take AI today will determine our future,\" he said.\nModi further underscored the need for global standards to address emerging digital threats such as deepfakes, calling for clear authentication mechanisms for AI-generated content.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "When people talk about higher education in Delhi-NCR, Galgotias University is often part of the conversation. The university is known for its courses, campus life and large student base.\nRight now, it is also in the news due to a controversy over a robot dog on campus. At the same time, many are looking at the journey of its founder, Suneel Galgotia, and how his family business grew over the decades.\nHow Suneel Galgotia Built The Institution\nGalgotias University was set up in 2011 near the Yamuna Expressway in Greater Noida. It offers many undergraduate, postgraduate and PhD courses. Today, the university is led by Dhruv Galgotia, the son of Suneel Galgotia, who serves as CEO.\nThe roots of this large education group go back many years. The Galgotia family once owned a bookstore called ‘E.D. Galgotia & Sons’ in Connaught Place, Delhi. The shop was started in 1933 at B-17, Inner Circle, during the British Raj. It became a well-known place for books and stayed open for over 80 years.\nSuneel Galgotia grew up around this bookstore. Later, when he took charge of the family business, he decided to expand. In the 1980s, he started Galgotia Publications. Over time, he moved further into the education sector.\nIn 2000, he began Galgotias Institute of Management and Technology (GIMT) with just 40 students. After that, he launched Galgotias College of Engineering and Technology. In 2011, he established Galgotias University in Greater Noida.\nFrom Small Bookshop To Rs 3000 Crore Group\nWhat began as a single bookstore slowly turned into a large education group. Today, reportedly more than 40,000 students study under the Galgotias banner. Students from over 40 countries come here for higher education, and alumni are spread across 96 nations.\nAs per reports, the family’s education business is estimated to be worth around Rs 3000 crore. Over the years, the group expanded step by step, adding new institutes and courses.\nThe original Galgotia Book Shop at B-17 is now marked as closed. Reports suggest it shut down around 2015 due to online competition and changes in the area. Another listing of E.D. Galgotia and Sons at No. 21 in Connaught Place reportedly remained on some directories with working hours (9:30 AM–6:30 PM, closed Sundays), but there is no clear update about its current operations.\nMeanwhile, the Galgotias group now runs bookstores within its university campuses in Noida.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "The Supreme Court on Thursday slammed the freebies culture ahead of the elections and said that it was high time to revisit such policies, as it hampers the country’s economic development. Further coming down heavily on the Tamil Nadu government in view of the distribution of ‘freebies’ before elections, the apex court questioned, “What kind of culture are you trying to cultivate?\"\nThe top court’s comments came in regard to the Tamil Nadu Power Distribution Corporation Ltd’s plea, which proposed to provide free electricity to all, irrespective of the financial status of consumers.\nA bench comprising Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi emphasised that while it is the state’s responsibility is to empower its people, giving out freebies from morning to night is not the way to build the nation. Most states are already running a revenue deficit, and such policies only exacerbate the situation, leaving no funds for development.\n“Most of the states in the country are revenue-deficient states, and yet they are offering such freebies, overlooking development,\" the Bench said.\nThe bench said economic development of the nation gets hampered with this kind of largesse distribution and states should work to open avenues for employment instead of giving free food, cycles, electricity to all.\nFollowing this, the Supreme Court issued a notice to the Centre and others on the plea of the DMK government-led power distribution firm, which proposes to provide free electricity. The power firm has challenged a rule of the Electricity Amendment Rules, 2024.\n“What kind of culture are we developing in India? It is understandable that as part of the welfare measure, you want to provide to those who are incapable of paying the electricity charges. But without drawing a distinction between those who can afford and those who cannot, you start distributing. Will it not amount to an appeasing policy,\" CJI Surya Kant asked.\nThe Bench further raised questions on the sudden decision of the Tamil Nadu power firm to provide free electricity.\n“The states should work to open avenues for employment. If you start giving free food from morning to evening, then free cycle, then free electricity, then who will work and then what will happen to the work culture,\" the CJI said.\nThe bench said states, instead of spending on development projects, do two jobs – paying salaries and distributing such largesse.\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "Bihar Unveils ‘Game-Changing’ E-Voting At AI Summit 2026 — But Is India’s First-Of-Its-Kind System Fraud-Proof?",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has entered into public systems such as elections. At the India-AI Impact Summit 2026, one of the most talked-about presentations came from Bihar’s State Election Commission which showcased a mobile-based AI-driven remote voting system.\nAccording to a report in NDTV, the commission is preparing to scale this model further and may expand it for use in the next Assembly elections.\nLet’s take a look at this tech innovation in detail.\nWhat Is Bihar’s AI-Based Remote Voting Model?\nBihar has introduced what it calls India’s first mobile-enabled remote voting platform. The system was first used during the 2025 urban local body elections and later presented at the summit as a model of digital governance.\nThe voting facility works through dedicated Android application, namely “e-Voting SECBHR\" which is developed by the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) in collaboration with the State Election Commission.\nThe system is designed mainly for people who face difficulty reaching polling booths. This includes migrant workers living outside their home districts, students, senior citizens, pregnant women, persons with disabilities and those who are unwell.\nHow Does The System Work?\nTo vote remotely, users must download the official app on an Android phone. Accessing the app requires verification via OTP which will be sent on the mobile number provided.\nIt is followed by live selfie verification. The system uses AI-based facial recognition to match the selfie with the voter’s EPIC (Electors Photo Identity Card) ID photograph. Once identity checks are cleared, the voter can cast their vote through the app.\nThe system was first used live on June 28 last year during municipal by-elections.\nWhat Security Measures Does The System Use?\nAs per the reports, platform has several layers of protection. These include AI facial recognition combined with liveness detection to ensure that a real person is present during verification.\nBefore the vote is recorded, OTP authentication and dual encryption are needed to be done. After the votes are casted, they are encrypted and stored using blockchain technology which is a tamper-resistant record.\nThe are audit trails similar to Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) as well. After polling ends, decryption is allowed only through secure digital signatures and multi-factor authentication by election authorities.\nWhat Features Ensure That There Is No Tampering?\nBlockchain plays a central role in protecting votes. Each vote is encrypted, anonymised and added as a new block in a decentralised ledger.\nTo alter a vote, someone would need to rewrite the entire blockchain across multiple distributed nodes which officials say is practically impossible due to computational limits.\nDecryption keys are only known to election authorities. And they are used only after polling concludes.\nHow Is Voter Privacy Ensured?\nOfficials say the system has been designed to protect voter secrecy at every stage. Before a vote is recorded, it is encrypted and de-identified so that the identity of the voter is not linked to the choice made. The verification of identity happens at the beginning of the process through EPIC-linked facial recognition, liveness detection and OTP authentication. Once verification is complete, the vote is anonymised and stored on a blockchain-backed ledger using secure hashing and smart contracts.\nFor counting, decryption is tightly controlled. It requires the use of Returning Officers’ Digital Signature Certificates (DSCs), along with two-factor authentication and post-poll hash verification. Authorities say this ensures that results can be audited without revealing how any individual voted.\nWhat Are The Potential Vulnerabilities?\nDespite strong safety measures, some risks also loom. It allows up to two voters to register on a single device.\nThere are also fears about impersonation and misuse especially in households where one individual may influence another’s vote. Initial verification partly relies on voter ID entry and there have been reports of facial recognition failures in some attempts.\nThe system is currently available only on Android devices which excludes iOS users.\nWhat Are The Privacy Concerns Related To The System?\nThis application collects personal data such as voter ID details, phone numbers, biometric information and device metadata.\nNaturally, this raises a question: How long this data will be stored? And whether there are clear policies on third-party access?\nHow Has The System Been Evaluated So Far?\nDuring the pilot phase, out of 14,804 attempts, 3,830 mock registrations were successfully completed.\nBihar officials maintain that EPIC-linked checks, encryption layers and post-poll decryption controls ensure that only genuine voters participate and that ballots remain secret.\nBut cybersecurity experts and organisations such as the Internet Freedom Foundation have urged caution. They recommend stronger oversight and regulatory clarity before expanding the system to full-scale Assembly elections.\nLatest Blogs",

A health infrastructure that has issued 500 million digital health IDs.\"\n#WATCH | Delhi: At the #IndiaAIImpactSummit2026, French President Emmanuel Macron says, “India built something that no other country in the world has built.

We are clearly at the beginning of a huge acceleration, and you perfectly described it during your interventions,\" he added during his keynote address.\nThe French President further highlighted a story of a street vendor in Mumbai and said that about 10 years ago, the world told India that 1.4 billion people could not be brought into the digital economy, but the country proved everybody wrong.\n“Today, some say AI is a game only the biggest can play. India, France, Europe, together with our partners, those who believe in our approach, companies, governments, investors, might have a different way,\" Macron said, adding, “The future of AI will be built by those who combine innovation and responsibility, technology with humanity, and India and France will help to shape this future together.\"\nOn Wednesday, Macron sparked buzz on social media after he shared a creative post featuring an AI-generated image alongside Prime Minister Narendra Modi, signalling excitement for the ongoing AI Impact Summit 2026.\nWhen friends connect, innovation follows.

        "title": "Who Is Neha Singh? Galgotias Professor Goes ‘Open To Work’ On LinkedIn After AI Summit Robodog Mess",
        "content": "Noida-based Galgotias University exited the India AI Impact Summit following a controversy over presenting a Chinese robodog as its own.\nProfessor Neha Singh, the main person at the centre of the debate, has updated her LinkedIn profile to “Open to Work.\"\nGalgotias University Professor Changes LinkedIn Status\nNeha’s LinkedIn bio highlighted her focus on communication skills.\n“I have always believed that communication is more than just a skill — it is a force that shapes identity, builds confidence, and opens doors. With a natural flair for language, articulation, and stage presence, I have spent years helping individuals unlock their voice and express themselves with clarity and impact,\" she wrote.\n“What sets me apart is not just my command of language, but the ability to connect, inspire, and elevate others through it. I enjoy working with learners at various stages — guiding them to communicate with confidence, professionalism, and authenticity,\" the bio further stated.\nWhat Triggered The Controversy?\nThe issue began after a video clip caught widespread attention that showed Neha introducing a robotic dog named “Orion.\" In the clip, she described it as being “developed\" by the university’s Centre of Excellence.\nBut it was later alleged that the machine was actually the Unitree Go2, an AI-powered robotic dog manufactured by China-based company Unitree Robotics and not an indigenously developed product.\nThis led to criticism that imported technology was being presented as homegrown innovation.\nProfessor Issues Clarification\nNeha said there was no intention to mislead while responding to the controversy. She explained that the situation arose out of “enthusiasm and unclear expression\" rather than a deliberate claim.\n“The controversy happened because things may not have been expressed clearly. I take accountability that perhaps I did not communicate it properly, as it was done with a lot of energy and enthusiasm and very quickly,\" she said.\nShe added that her remarks were not articulated clearly and expressed regret over how they were interpreted.\nResponding to the allegations, Singh clarified that the university had not built the robotic dog. She explained that the machine was purchased as part of the institution’s investment in artificial intelligence and was intended to serve as a practical learning tool for students, rather than an in-house innovation.\nVIDEO | Delhi: Professor Neha Singh of Galgotias University responds to reports of the university being asked to vacate its stall at the AI Summit Expo, says, “The controversy happened because things may not have been expressed clearly.

The university said it had never claimed to have built the robotic dog and that the device was procured for academic and demonstration purposes.\n“Let us be clear, Galgotias has not built this robodog, nor have we claimed to do so. What we are building are minds that will soon design, engineer and manufacture such technologies in Bharat,\" the statement read.\nOn Wednesday, the university again issued a statement where it apologised and stated that the representative at the pavilion had provided “factually incorrect information\" in haste and without authorisation.\n“We at Galgotias University wish to apologise profusely for the confusion created at the recent AI Summit. One of our representatives, manning the pavilion, was ill-informed. She was not aware of the technical origins of the product and, in her enthusiasm for being on camera, gave factually incorrect information even though she was not authorised to speak to the press,\" the educational institute stated.\nhttps://twittercom/GalgotiasGU/status/2024085155414233572?s=20\nGovernment’s Position\nFollowing the allegations, the university was directed to vacate its stall at the summit venue in the national capital. Soon after, the electricity supply to the pavilion was disconnected, and staff, along with students, proceeded to dismantle and clear the exhibit.\nIT Secretary S Krishnan said the government does not want any exhibitor to showcase items that are not their own. “We do not want such exhibits to continue,\" he said.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "In a shocking incident, a man allegedly killed his wife and buried her inside their house compound in Devarahipparagi town of Vijayapura district in Karnataka, with the crime coming to light 24 days later.\nAccording to the police, the deceased has been identified as Sarojini Ratnakar (45), while the accused as Prabhu Ratnakar (46).\nPrabhu had allegedly taken loans in Sarojini’s name, which often led to disputes between the couple. On the night of January 23, the two were reportedly involved in a heated argument. The following day, January 24, Prabhu allegedly killed Sarojini by hitting her on the head with an iron rod.\nLater, he is said to have buried her body within the house premises and fabricated a story claiming that she had left home and not returned. He even lodged a missing complaint at the Devarahipparagi police station and joined her parental family in the search for her.\nDuring the course of the investigation, the police grew suspicious of Prabhu and summoned him for questioning. During sustained interrogation, he reportedly confessed, leading to the revelation of the truth behind the case.\nPolice later exhumed the body following due legal procedure. After conducting the post-mortem examination, the body was handed over to the family.\nFollowing a complaint lodged by Sarojini’s mother, a case has been registered against Prabhu. Further investigation into the incident is underway.\nLatest Blogs",

The  Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has instructed the airlines to report such passengers.\nThe aviation regulator said the move is aimed at ensuring the safety of aircraft, people and property, and at maintaining good order and discipline on board.\n\n\nThe DGCA has also issued draft rules on how airlines must handle such passengers on aircraft.\nUnder the changes proposed by DGCA chief Faiz Ahmed Kidwai, airlines will now be required to put in place procedures to deal with unruly passengers both at the airport and on board the aircraft. The SOP on this will be communicated throughout the organisation and especially to all employees who are in direct contact with passengers, both on the ground and on the aircraft.\nThe draft also states that the “no-fly rules\" will apply to all passengers during the period of air travel to or from India. This means that this rule is not just limited to Indian carriers and airports, the rules will also apply to unruly passengers travelling on foreign airlines on flights to and from India, if those carriers report the matter.\n\n\nThe draft classifies unruly conduct into four categories:\nLevel 1: Unruly behaviour such as physical gestures, verbal harassment and disruptive drunken conduct.\nLevel 2: Physically abusive actions including pushing, kicking, hitting, grabbing, inappropriate touching or sexual harassment.\nLevel 3: Life-threatening behaviour, including damage to aircraft operating systems and serious physical violence such as choking, eye gouging or attempted murder.\nLevel 4: Attempted or actual breach of the flight crew compartment.\nLatest Blogs",
