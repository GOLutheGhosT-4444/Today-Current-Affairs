Tamil Nadu Minister for Finance and Human Resource Management Palanivel Thiaga Rajan. File picture | Photo Credit: The Hindu The Madras High Court was on Wednesday (February 4, 2026) told a “mischievous” writ petition had been filed in the court accusing Information Technology and Digital Services Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan of having “induced and misled” a Madurai-based couple to part with their 2.26 acres of land. Appearing before Justice P.T. Asha, senior counsel V. Raghavachari, representing Madurai based chartered accountant P.V. Rajarajeswaran, said: “This is an absolutely mischievous writ petition. The petitioner has filed this case without any cause. I will expose this gentleman thoroughly.” However, since the counsel representing the writ petitioner, Jai Balaji Subramaniyan (42), sought time to amend the prayer in his writ petition in view of certain developments, the judge, in a lighter vein, told Mr. Raghavachari: “You expose him after he files the petition for amendment.” She directed the Registry to list the petition after the filing of the amendment plea. In his affidavit, the petitioner claimed that he and his wife R. Kalavathy owned 2.26 acres of land at Kodikulam village in Madurai East Taluk. He claimed to have purchased the property on May 20, 2024. Though the couple was interested in converting the land into multiple residential plots, they were clueless about the statutory approvals required from multiple authorities such as the Directorate of Town and Country Planning (DTCP), the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) and others. “Acknowledging these circumstances, the honourable Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan voluntarily involved and promised that he could get the work done for us, as he had good source of people who are well conversant in all the procedures and technicalities of this matter,” the affidavit read. The petitioner also claimed he and his wife had executed a general power of attorney in favour of the chartered accountant, at the instance of the Minister, on June 24, 2024 and handed over original title documents too on being told that they were required to obtain DTCP and RERA approval. “However, during the month of April-May 2025, I came to know that the said power of attorney was being misused for the purpose of unlawfully alienating my property. Only then, I realized that we were being induced and misled by the Honble Minister for an unlawful gain,” the petitioner alleged. He also said that a writ petition was filed in the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court last year against the refusal of Madurai North Sub Registrar to register a deed for revoking the power of attorney and that the Bench had passed an interim order in his favour on May 8, 2025. Further, alleging that steps were taken to sell the property to a private firm using a fabricated life certificate issued by a government doctor, the petitioner said, he had also got the Othakadai police in Madurai register a First Information Report (FIR) on October 14, 2025 regarding the fabricated life certificate. Thereafter, the petitioner had approached the Lok Ayukta on December 19, 2025 accusing the Minister of having absued his official position and filed the present writ petition seeking a direction to the Lok Ayukta to dispose of his complaint in accordance with law. Though the writ petition was filed in the High Court Registry on January 23, 2026; it got numbered on February 2, 2026 and listed for admission on Wednesday (February 4, 2026). In the meantime, the petitioner had received a show cause notice from the Lok Ayukta on January 30, 2026 asking why his complaint should not be rejected. Stating there were no substantial allegations of corruption or coercion against the Minister, the Lok Ayukta wanted to why the petitioner’s complaint should not be rejected. Since the Lok Ayukta had responded after the filing of the writ petition, the counsel sought the court’s permission to amend the prayer accordingly.

Union Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal. File | Photo Credit: ANI Countering Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal’s statement in Parliament that “India’s sensitive sectors of agriculture and dairy have been excluded” in the Indo-U.S. bilateral trade deal, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) said here on Wednesday (February 4, 2026) that the government’s stand was contradictory to the claim made by U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins that the U.S. would “export more American farm products to India’s massive market, lifting prices, and pumping cash into rural America.” The umbrella body of several farmers’ organisations sought clarification from the Centre on Ms. Rollins’s claim that the deal would help to reduce the U.S.’s $1.3 billion agricultural trade deficit with India. “The Commerce Minister did not object or deny the claim of Ms. Rollins. Mr. Goyal’s statement is unscrupulous and aimed to misguide the people, especially the farmers, and hence he has no moral authority to continue in the constitutional position,” the SKM statement said. Parliament Budget Session Day 6: Follow the updates from February 4, 2026 The SKM warned Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the country would witness a repeat of farmers’ protest similar to 2020-21 (against the three farm laws) if any agricultural product or dairy was included in the U.S. trade deal. “The Prime Minister remains silent on this most serious and sensitive issue affecting the livelihood of crores of working people across India,” the SKM added. The farmers’ body said Mr. Goyal’s stand that Mr. Modi had “always protected the agriculture and dairy sectors and has never compromised on their interests” was factually wrong and dishonest. Despite a promise by Mr. Modi that he would stand with farmers, the SKM said the Centre lifted the 11% import duty on cotton in India. “The entire cotton area is the highest peasant suicide-prone region of India. The elimination of import duty on cotton further eliminated the livelihood security of lakhs of cotton farmer households. The cotton import from the U.S. surged 95.50% from $199.30 million in January-November 2024 to $377.90 million in January-November 2025. Wheat and soya bean oil imports also surged during this period,” the SKM said. “The U.S trade deal also targets government procurement and minimum support price and subsidies. The deal will help to overcome a $40 billion trade deficit and solve the glut in the U.S. crop market,” the organisation added. Citing Mr. Goyal’s statement that the deal was not yet finalised, the SKM asked why the Prime Minister was forced to announce the deal without finalising the details of the agreement, and alleged that it was done under the pressure of U.S. President Donald Trump. The SKM added that it exposed the sad plight of governance under the Modi government, the absolute compromise on protecting the sovereignty of India and abject surrender to U.S. imperialism.

Data Point Decoding the headlines with facts, figures, and numbers Health Matters Ramya Kannan writes to you on getting to good health, and staying there The Hindu On Books Books of the week, reviews, excerpts, new titles and features. The High Court of Karnataka on Wednesday said that it prima facie accepts that in situ rehabilitation of evicted families may not be feasible in Fakir Colony and Waseem Colony of Kogilu Layout, where the authorities had demolished around 167 sheds illegally built by encroaching upon government land. A division bench comprising Chief Justice Vibhu Bakhru and Justice C.M. Poonacha made this observation in its interim order during the hearing of a PIL petition filed by Zaiba Tabassum, Rehana and Areefa Begum, who were among the persons evicted from the two colonies. The bench recorded its prima facie view after noticing the stand of the State government that no rehabilitation can be permitted on the government lands, where the colonies had come up, as toxic waste is stored in the land, as it was earlier used as a landfill for dumping city’s mixed garbage. One of the requests made in the petition was for providing rehabilitation on the same government land from where they were evicted. Meanwhile, the Bench appointed advocate Vidyulatha B.V. as amicus curiae and asked her to file a report on the demolished land, temporary rehabilitation centres set up by the civic bodies in four community halls, and facilities in these centres. The Bench directed the Karnataka State Legal Services Authority to assist her. Earlier, State Advocate General K. Shashi Kiran Shetty told the court that of the seven allotment letters produced by the petitioners, three belong to lands outside the encroached land and no files with regard to other four letters could be traced. Meanwhile, advocates for the petitioners complained to the Bench that some rehabilitation centres were found locked when the evicted persons visited and even the contact number displayed in the centre was erroneous.

The Greater Bengaluru Authority (GBA) will hold a two-day Open House to highlight citizen-identified public space projects and encourage their adoption and funding by the city’s five corporations and external partners. The Open House, scheduled for February 6 and 7 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m at the Town Hall, is part of the city-level initiative “Bayasidante Bayalu”, launched in May 2025 to revitalise underutilised public spaces across Bengaluru. The initiative aims to change Bengaluru’s roads and streets as transport corridors as inclusive, citizen-centric public spaces. As part of this, citizens were invited to nominate neglected or underused public spaces in their neighbourhoods for improvement. Officials said the response was substantial, with over 250 nominations received from across the city. After preliminary checks, 194 locations were identified as feasible and added to a city-level public repository. According to data shared by the GBA, the Central City Corporation accounts for 43 identified locations, followed by the South City Corporation with 50 sites, the North City Corporation with 49, the West City Corporation with 31, and the East City Corporation with 21.

Data Point Decoding the headlines with facts, figures, and numbers Health Matters Ramya Kannan writes to you on getting to good health, and staying there The Hindu On Books Books of the week, reviews, excerpts, new titles and features. Published - February 04, 2026 09:12 pm IST - THIRUVANANTHAPURAM Ending prolonged uncertainty over funding for the proposed Sabari rail project, the Cabinet here on Wednesday decided that the State would bear 50% of the cost of the Angamaly–Erumely Sabari Railway Project and raise its share of ₹1,900 crore through the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB). The State had earlier sought full exemption from the Centre for the debt incurred by the KIIFB for financing the project outside the State’s borrowing limits. Previously, the State government had rejected the Union government’s proposal for a tripartite agreement involving the State, the Ministry of Railways and the Reserve Bank of India to implement the project. With the State now expressing its willingness to meet its share of the cost through KIIFB without any conditions, the project — first proposed in the 1997-98 Railway Budget — has finally been set in motion after a hiatus of nearly three decades. The project is expected to bring transformative changes to Kerala’s overall development, particularly boosting the economy of the hilly regions. The 110-km railway line will provide a safe and convenient route for Sabarimala pilgrims and significantly enhance connectivity and economic growth in the eastern highland regions of Ernakulam, Idukki and Pathanamthitta districts. Once completed, Angamaly, situated on National Highway 66, will be directly connected to towns such as Perumbavoor, Muvattupuzha, Thodupuzha and Pala. In the initial phase, land acquisition for an 8-km stretch had been completed, and nearly 90% of the construction work on the 7-km Angamaly–Kalady section was completed several years ago. However, land acquisition notifications issued for the remaining stretches have since lapsed, necessitating a fresh (de novo) acquisition process. The project has remained stalled for over 25 years due to multiple hurdles, including protests against land acquisition and the failure to allocate adequate funds in successive Railway Budgets. While the project was originally estimated to cost ₹2,815 crore, the revised cost has risen to ₹3,800.9 crore, with the State now required to bear half of the expenditure. A total of 303.58 hectares will need to be acquired for the project. Land acquisition alone is estimated to cost ₹1,361 crore, while construction expenditure is pegged at ₹2,439.93 crore. The required land will be acquired across Ernakulam, Idukki and Kottayam districts. Revenue authorities have been directed to initiate the land acquisition process, and the Cabinet has decided to formally inform the Union Ministry of Railways of its decision. This marks the first instance in India where a State government has taken responsibility for funding a railway project. The State had previously contributed ₹5,580 crore through KIIFB towards land acquisition for National Highway development in Kerala.

BJP national president Nitin Nabin alleged that a ‘Commissions Government’ is operating in Telangana, claiming that an ‘RR Tax’ - Revanth and Rahul” has to be paid for any work to be carried out or bills to be cleared. He also accused the “land mafia” of dominating governance in the State. Addressing his maiden public meeting in Mahabubnagar (Telangana) on Wednesday, after taking charge as party president, to galvanise the cadre for the municipal polls, Mr. Nabin charged that the Congress government is practising “appeasement politics”. Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy’s recent remarks has exposed the political motives behind trying to please a certain section of population, he said. While the Modi government at the Centre has introduced a Waqf Act, the State government has been strengthening the Waqf Board with a jurisdiction of over 77,000 acres, he alleged and also questioned its ‘silence’ over repeated acts of vandalism at temples. “We will fight against this government. We will uphold ‘Sanatana Dharma’ traditions and will not tolerate anyone ridiculing our customs and practices,” he declared. Earlier, the BJP president was welcomed with much fanfare by party leaders and workers at the Shamshabad airport on Wednesday. Mr. Nabin urged party workers to reach out to every voter and explain the government’s failure in fulfilling promises such as financial assistance for women, support for farm labourers, loan waivers, and other commitments. “We should tell them that only the BJP can ensure justice by explaining about the ‘Good Governnance’ at the Centre,” he said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a special affection for Telangana, reflected in the rollout of various schemes, with the sanctioning of high-speed trains being the latest. “Our cadre must work to strengthen the party’s base and vote share in each booth, so that the lotus blooms in the next elections. It is not for power but for Telangana’s self respect and future,”he said. Rajya Sabha MP K. Laxman translated his Hindi speech into Telugu. Telangana BJP president N. Ramchander Rao condemned the “misleading and provocative” statements of PCC chief Mahesh Kumar Goud that the BJP would provoke people in the name of religion during the polls. Stating that both the BRS and Congress are wary of BJP, he expressed confidence that the party would win the highest number of seats. Union Minister for Coal & Mines G. Kishan Reddy said that the two-year rule of Mr. Revanth Reddy has benefited neither Mahabubnagar nor Telangana, and alleged that both the BRS and Congress are merely play-acting as rivals. Local MP D.K. Aruna and others also spoke. Copyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies. All rights reserved. Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Vikrama Simhapuri University Vice-Chancellor Allam Srinivasa Rao addressing the students during the workshop on ‘APAAR Credit Seeding’ at Kakatur in SPSR Nellore district on Wednesday. | Photo Credit: ARRANGEMENT A one-day State-level workshop on Academic Bank of Credits – Automated Permanent Academic Account Registry (APAAR) credit seeding was conducted at Vikrama Simhapuri University (VSU) on Wednesday. The programme was jointly organised by Andhra Pradesh State Council of Higher Education (APSCHE), National Academic Depository (NAD), and the University Grants Commission (UGC). Addressing the gathering, VSU Vice-Chancellor Allam Srinivasa Rao said that the APAAR system enables the secure digital storage of students’ academic credits. He emphasised that the initiative would effectively address issues such as discontinuation of education and provide strong academic support for students’ future careers. Speaking on the occasion, APSCHE Vice-Chairperson K. Ratna Sheela Mani said that the APAAR system serves as the backbone of the Multiple Entry–Exit system proposed under the National Education Policy (NEP)-2020. She noted that the APAAR would play a vital role in enhancing transparency, coordination, and efficiency among higher education institutions across the State.

Published - February 04, 2026 08:56 pm IST - Thiruvananthapuram Minister for Agriculture P. Prasad has criticised a letter from the Union government demanding that Kerala discontinue the State Incentive Bonus provided by it for paddy procurement. The State implements a model decentralised paddy procurement scheme, the Minister said at a press conference here on Wednesday. The paddy cultivated in the State, he said, was fully procured by the government at ₹30 a kg, which included the minimum support price (MSP) of ₹23.69 and the State Incentive Bonus of ₹6.31. The average productivity of paddy in the State was 3,006 kg a hectare (ha) against the national average of 2,899 kg. This was made possible owing to the support given to paddy farmers by the government. It was against this backdrop that the Expenditure Secretary in the Union Finance Ministry had written to the Kerala Chief Secretary seeking that the State stop providing the State Incentive Bonus, the Minister said. According to the letter, bumper production of paddy and wheat had resulted in stocks far in excess of requirements of the public distribution system and buffer norms. The surplus rose every year, creating a recurrent burden on the public exchequer. The announcement of additional bonus on paddy (and wheat), over and above the MSP, would result in higher sowing and production of foodgrain. Disproportionate cultivation of of paddy cultivation had serious implications for sustainability, climate resilience, and public health. At the same time, inadequate domestic production of oilseeds and pulses was compelling higher imports. In such a situation, the Kerala government should consider “discontinuing the bonus” and shift attention towards incentives to promote pulses, oilseeds, and millets. The Minister argued that the Union government was portraying the increase in production of paddy as a burden and demotivating farmers. This was part of a planned move to reduce production of paddy and increase imports of oilseeds and pulses in the wake of the India-U.S. trade deal. Agriculture was on the State List and comprehensive discussions should be held with States on any trade agreement that impacted the farm sector. However, no such talks were held, the Minister said. Import of foodgrain, even in limited quantities, would pose a serious threat to the livelihood of farmers in the country, the Minister said, demanding that the Union government withdraw from the trade deal with the U.S. Copyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Deputy Chief Minister Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka on Wednesday said that the screening process for the Gaddar Film Awards will begin on February 6, with the awards ceremony scheduled for March 19, coinciding with Ugadi. Addressing the jury members of Gaddar Film Awards during a meeting at the Secretariat, he said that last year’s event sent a powerful message globally and assured that this edition too would be organised on a grand scale. “The FDC and the Information & Public Relations Department have been granted full autonomy and support to conduct the event,” he said. Assuring transparency in the selection process, the Deputy CM recalled that last year’s jury earned widespread appreciation for its impartiality. The current jury, appointed through consultations by the Film Development Corporation (FDC), comprises experienced and respected figures from the industry. He said the government would extend full cooperation to ensure a smooth selection process. Reiterating that the ‘Praja Palana’ aims to ensure public welfare through every initiative, he urged jury members to consider not just commercial appeal but also strong social messages while choosing award winning films, so as to encourage impactful storytelling. “The State government is giving top priority to the Telugu film industry and is striving to transform Hyderabad into the country’s leading hub for cinema production,” he said. The Deputy Chief Minister noted that traditional film centres such as Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai have limited scope for expansion, whereas Hyderabad offers significant advantages for filmmakers across languages. He added that the State government will soon prepare a comprehensive blueprint to strengthen the ecosystem. He paid rich tributes to revolutionary balladeer Gaddar on the occasion. FDC chairman Dil Raju, I&PR Commissioner Priyanka, and several noted film personalities attended the meeting. Copyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Updated - February 04, 2026 09:02 pm IST - THIRUVANANTHAPURAM The trade deal with the U.S will adversely impact the Indian economy, Finance Minister K.N. Balagopal said on Wednesday. Replying to the general discussion on the State Budget 2026-27 in the House, Mr. Balagopal said the trade deal signals danger, especially for the nation’s farm sector. He called for strong protests against the agreement. Mr. Balagopal alleged that directives issued by the U.S. are being implemented in India. The situation is such that the X account of (U.S. President Donald) Trump has to be checked out to know what is happening in India, he said, in an apparent reference to the allegation that the Narendra Modi government had kept Parliament in the dark about the trade deal. Mr. Balagopal defended the 2026-27 State Budget, which he had presented in the Assembly on january 29, saying that it was a carefully thought one and contained feasible announcements. On the United Democratic Front boycotting the procedures over the Sabarimala gold theft issue, Mr. Balagopal said the Opposition appeared disinterested in discussing the Budget. Industries Minister P. Rajeeve, speaking on the occasion, demanded that the Opposition be asked to tender an apology for disrupting the Budget session of the Assembly. The Left Democratic Front government also reiterated its stand that the Dedicated Rare Earth Corridor mooted by it was aimed at establishing related industries within the State. The proposal was part of the Union Budget wishlist of the LDF government and had also featured in the latest State Budget. The Union Budget had announced the inclusion of Kerala among four States for the establishment of rare earth corridors. Copyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

The decision to conduct elections to the Karuvannur Service Cooperative Bank is a deliberate attempt by the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government to divert attention from one of the biggest financial frauds in the cooperative sector, alleged Thrissur District Congress Committee (DCC) president Joseph Tajet. Addressing the media here on Wednesday, Mr. Tajet criticised Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan for maintaining “a conspicuous silence” on the Sabarimala gold controversy during his address at the inaugural of the LDF’s Southern Region Vikasana Munnetta Jatha at Chelakkara. He noted that despite speaking for over an hour, the Chief Minister did not utter a single word on the issue which affected lakhs of devotees. Drawing a parallel, he said the Karuvannur bank fraud was another instance where the government had shielded the guilty. Instead of coming clean on the facts, the government was now rushing into elections to create a smokescreen and bury the truth. Depositors, he pointed out, continue to live in uncertainty. While initial reports had pegged the fraud at around ₹400 crore, Cooperation Minister V.N. Vasavanlater informed the Assembly, in reply to a submission by MLA T. Siddique in November 2025, that the loss stood at ₹268 crore. “Even today, no one knows how much money is actually owed, how much will be repaid, or when,” he said. It is under these circumstances, Mr. Tajet alleged, that the government is pushing the bank into elections on February 22, openly challenging depositors and the public. With the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] enjoying a numerical advantage among members, the same management is expected to return to power, allowing the government to wash its hands of responsibility. He further alleged a political conspiracy involving both the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the CPI(M) in the Karuvannur case, claiming that despite investigations by the Enforcement Directorate and the Crime Branch, several party leaders arrested in connection with the scam had secured bail. The CPI(M), which has been in control of the bank since 2000, bears complete responsibility for the fraud, he asserted. The DCC president demanded that the government publish a white paper detailing the bank’s current financial position and clearly state whether the depositors’ money can be repaid in full. Protesting what he described as the government’s anti-depositor stance, he announced that the Congress would boycott the Karuvannur bank elections.

Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan met with a delegation of top administrators of 24 Canadian universities on Wednesday (February 4, 2026). They were led by Canada’s Ambassador to India, Christopher Cooter. The Minister urged the delegation to establish international campuses in India to help “build a workforce of the future” and to create models for “advancing the long-term educational agenda”. University presidents from Canadian Universities are currently in India to “meet with leaders from India’s higher education sector, government, and industry in Goa, New Delhi, and the Gujarat International Finance Tech-City (GIFT City) to explore opportunities for research collaboration, academic exchange and sustainable models of transnational education”, according to a statement by Universities Canada last month.

Appreciate their keenness to deepen academic and research engagements with Indian HEIs and further strengthen… pic.twitter.com/U5FeiDeYo9 On Wednesday (February 4, 2026), after meeting with the delegation, Mr. Pradhan posted a statement on social media, calling for “strengthening academic, research and innovation capacities, and talent development”. “Appreciate their keenness to deepen academic and research engagements with Indian HEIs and further strengthen India-Canada cooperation in higher education,” the Education Minister added. The Economic Survey of India 2025-26 and a recent report commissioned by the NITI Aayog have called for a focus on the “internationalisation” of the higher education sector in India. In the Statement announcing their visit to India, Universities Canada said that the delegation’s visit was prompted by the “Government of Canada’s recent announcement highlighting renewed momentum in Canada-India relations and the launch of negotiations toward a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA)”. According to information tabled in Parliament by the Education Ministry this month, the University Grants Commission (India’s principal federal higher education regulator) has so far issued 14 Letters of Intent (LoIs) to foreign higher education institutes (FHEIs) from Australia, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America to set up campuses in India. These campuses will be set up in Bengaluru, Delhi NCR, Mumbai, and Chennai. The government has announced that approvals have also been granted to five Universities from Australia and the UK to establish offshore campuses in GIFT City, Gandhinagar, Gujarat. The University of Southampton (UK) campus in Gurugram started functioning last August (2025), while the campuses of Deakin University and the University of Wollongong started courses in 2024. The Ministry of Education went on to say, “The FHEIs proposing to open branch campuses in India plan to run programmes in business, economics, accounting, finance, software engineering, data science, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, game design, entrepreneurship, innovation, and biomedical sciences, among other emerging fields to meet global academic and industry demand.” education / universities and colleges / Canada Copyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Published - February 04, 2026 08:12 pm IST - Thiruvananthapuram The government is considering setting up a government lower primary school at Elambra in Manjeri municipality of Malappuram district, Minister for General Education V. Sivankutty has said. The Supreme Court had at the end of November upheld a High Court directive asking the State government to set up government lower and upper primary schools in all areas where none were functioning. The court was hearing an appeal of the State government against the Kerala High Court order on a petition seeking the setting up of a school at Elambra where there were no primary educational institutions within a 3-4-kilometre radius. It had directed the State to comply with the order within three months. Replying to a question in the Assembly recently on areas that lacked lower primary schools within a radius of 1 km and upper primary schools within 3 km and if new schools were proposed to be opened there, particularly in Elambra, the Minister said a mapping done in the wake of a High Court order of 2015 had found only four areas with urgent educational requirements. Upgrade of schools or opening new institutions considering only distances was impractical in the State. Nevertheless, the government issued an order in 2017 to make available transport facilities with the support of local self-government institutions in 82 areas where it was found that students were having difficulty in nearby schools. The Minister said that in 2012, the court had observed in a case that schools should be opened not only considering distances; it was enough to ensure that students were able to travel safely. The court had said that school upgrade should not become a reason to increase the number of uneconomic schools. The Minister’s reply, though, made no explicit mention of any review petition. In the wake of the Supreme Court judgment in November, the Minister had said that the State was considering filing a review petition in the Supreme Court. He had also argued that schools existed within a radius of 1-2 km of a majority of populated areas, and that the State’s low dropout ratio and high literacy rate were indicators that education was not being denied owing to lack of schools, he had said.

Political observer Joseph C. Mathew releasing a book authored by V. Kunhikrishnan, former Kannur district committee of the CPI(M), at Payyannur. The first copy was handed over to writer V.S. Anil Kumar. | Photo Credit: arranged A book authored by V. Kunhikrishnan, who was expelled from the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] Kannur district committee and its primary membership for alleging embezzlement of martyr’s fund by the party, was released at Gandhi Park in Payyannur on Wednesday amid heavy police security and strong opposition from the party. The book Nethruthwathe Anigal Nokki Tiruthanam (Leadership should be corrected by the Ranks), was released by Joseph C. Mathew, former IT adviser to ex-Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan. He handed over the first copy to writer V.S. Anil Kumar, son of the late critic M.N. Vijayan. Despite opposition from the CPI(M), a large crowd turned up for the event, with many coming onto the stage to congratulate Mr. Kunhikrishnan, while slogans of ‘Inquilab Zindabad’ were raised by the audience. In his welcome address, Mr. Kunhikrishnan alleged that a campaign was being carried out on new media platforms claiming that the book release had been postponed. He said that he was facing personal abuse, including nasty messages circulated through WhatsApp. Describing the attacks as attempts at ‘character assassination,’ he alleged that Goebbelsian propaganda tactics were being employed even now. Speaking after releasing the book, Mr. Mathew said that Mr. Kunhikrishnan was raising issues similar to those once raised by Achuthanandan, who he recalled, had been expelled from the Polit Bureau for standing by what he believed was the truth. He asked when communism and truth had become separate entities. Mr. Kunhikrishnan had earlier approached the High Court, citing the possibility of disruption by CPI(M) workers. Following this, heavy police security was arranged at the venue on the directive of the district police chief. The book release comes against the backdrop of sustained criticism from CPI(M) leaders. Over the past two days, CPI(M) State secretary M.V. Govindan and others had strongly attacked Mr. Kunhikrishnan. Addressing the reception of the LDF’s Vikasana Munnetta Jatha in Payyannur, Mr. Govindan had remarked that Mr. Kunhikrishnan’s place was “in the dustbin of history.” Party-affiliated cyber groups have also mounted sharp criticism of him on social media platforms.

The Social Justice Ministry has now recommended to the Office of the Registrar General of India that these denotified, nomadic, and semi-nomadic tribes be included in the upcoming Census. Photo: X/CensusIndia2027 Denotified tribes, nomadic tribes, and semi-nomadic tribes across the country are coming together to push for a “separate column” for themselves in the 2027 Census. Their demand is for constitutional recognition of the Denotified Tribes in a Schedule, on par with the existing classifications of Scheduled Castes and Tribes (SCs/STs) and other backward classes (OBCs). In February 2027, India will conduct a caste enumeration for the first time since 1931. Five years after that 1931 Census, the origins of the Scheduled Castes list came into being in the form of the Government of India (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1936. Half a century earlier, in 1871, a colonial law had classified entire communities, particularly nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes, as “criminals”. After the law was repealed in 1952, these groups became known as “denotified” tribes. The Social Justice Ministry has now recommended to the Office of the Registrar General of India that these denotified, nomadic, and semi-nomadic tribes be included in the upcoming Census. The Office of the RGI has agreed to include them in next year’s caste enumeration exercise, Ministry officials assured community leaders in north India in a virtual meeting on January 30. “But we have no idea how they will do this,” B.K. Lodhi, a community organiser in Uttar Pradesh who was at the January 30 meeting, told The Hindu. “If we are not counted in a separate column, a separate code, in the Census forms, we will be lost once again,” said 63-year-old Balak Ram Sansi, a Karnal-based organiser with the All India Denotified Nomadic Tribes Development Council. The government told Parliament on Wednesday that it has not yet finalised questions for caste enumeration, even as it is planning a preparatory exercise by July this year, as reported by The Hindu. Even as leaders from denotified, nomadic, and semi-nomadic communities across Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, and other parts of north India are fighting to have their own Schedule, some leaders have started to stress the importance of recognising “graded backwardness” within this grouping as well. They want the demand for sub-classification to go hand in hand with that for a separate Schedule. These leaders, like Dr. Lodhi, are drawing their arguments from an August 2024 judgement, in which the Supreme Court of India paved the way for sub-classification of SCs and STs. The Criminal Tribes Act was first enacted in 1871 and then amended in 1924, before being officially repealed on August 31, 1952. The 1871 Act said it was for the “registration, surveillance and control of certain criminal tribes and eunuchs”, describing “criminal tribes” as “tribe, gang, or class of persons” that are “addicted” to committing non-bailable offences. “These communities were amongst the first to confront the Britishers and sustained the struggle. Many of them were either nomadic communities from before or were forced to become nomadic as they kept resisting colonial administrators. That is why the colonial government classified us as ‘criminal tribes’,” Mr. Sansi said. After the Act was repealed in 1952, the communities notified as “criminal” under the law had become “denotified”, thus coming to be known as the denotified, nomadic, and semi-nomadic tribes (DNTs). The last National Commission for DNTs, headed by Bhiku Ramji Idate, identified 1,200 such tribes, most of which have been assimilated in the SC, ST, or OBC classifications over the last seven decades. In its 2017 report, however, the Idate Commission, also listed about 267 DNT communities that have not been classified as such. Dr. Lodhi, who served as Deputy Secretary and Director (Research) to the Idate Commission, said, “Most of the DNTs have been amalgamated in the SC, ST, OBC lists and they are not able to compete in these categories because of how marginalised they are.” Mr. Sansi added that it was “politics” that led to the DNT communities being “misclassified” within the existing lists of SCs, STs, or OBCs. “Now, we are in a place where communities in the SC category are unable to get out to protect the political strength of the grouping; they are lost in the OBC classification, and are unable to enter the ST classification because the threshold for this is too high. Ideally, most of these communities should have been classified in the ST list in 1950 itself,” Mr. Sansi argued, citing examples of communities in north India whose culture, lifestyle, food, and community laws would technically qualify them for being in the ST list but are not. “Even now, there are denotified, nomadic jatis in Haryana who do not have a single member who has completed their 10th class education. But they are in the SC list somehow and have been routinely crowded out by more politically powerful communities,” Mr. Sansi said. “Even though sub-classification has come into being for all three categories now, this will not be enough to recognise our specific situation and stigmatisation of having been classified as ‘criminal’ for fighting invading forces. We cannot also forget that about 260 communities are not even within these classifications,” Dr. Lodhi said. “What we need is a separate Schedule recognising this and sub-classification within that Schedule to recognise the graded backwardness between settled and nomadic denotified communities.” He went on to say that this is the only thing that will force the government to consider these communities as deserving of special attention, a separate quota, and schemes for their upliftment. “Till the 1960s, the communities that had been denotified were largely in the same situation of backwardness, regardless of whether they were settled or nomadic,” he said, adding that eventually, the “settled” communities were able to use the resources they had, such as land or businesses, to uplift themselves to a certain extent. “But it was the nomadic tribes that were left behind, socially, educationally, economically, and politically,” he said. Mr. Sansi added that their stigmatisation has continued despite denotification, as local police continue to treat them as “criminal” under the pretext of being “habitual offenders”. Despite schemes for DNTs run by both the State and Union Governments, such as the SEED scheme, only a “minuscule” percentage of people are getting benefits, mainly because State and Union Territory Governments are not willing to issue DNT certificates, the leaders said. The Social Justice Ministry has only spent ₹69.3 crore on the SEED scheme in the last five years (as of December 2025), compared to the planned expenditure of ₹200 crore. “The principal reason for this is that no State is issuing proper DNT community certificates for us despite constant reminders from the Centre to do so,” Dr. Lodhi said. Even as associations for denotified tribes are organising meetings to discuss the way forward given next year’s caste census, conversations within the community are focussed on the importance of “being counted”. In a virtual meeting of community leaders, largely from northern States, Mohit Tanwar said, “No matter where we go, to courts, to governments, or to political establishments, we face the question of what our numbers are.” While Dr. Lodhi asserts that there could be as many as seven crore people in Uttar Pradesh alone belonging to denotified communities, there are no definite figures for their population across the country.

Actor Mohanlal’s illegal ivory possession case has paved way for a general amnesty scheme to declare the possession of wildlife articles in Kerala. The State Forest Department will soon come out with a notification enabling the general public to declare the wildlife trophies in their possession by invoking Section 40 (4) of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972. The deadline for declaring the possession of such articles had expired on September 30, 1991, in Kerala. The proposed scheme would benefit the legal owners of articles, who could not declare them after the expiry of the time limit, sources said. The amnesty scheme would be open only to the wildlife articles in the legal possession of individuals. The Act specifies that the department shall make an inquiry and prepare an inventory of the articles for which a declaration has been sought. Once declared, the owners will get ownership certificates for the articles and immunity from any legal action. The government decision comes in the wake of a recent Kerala High Court verdict cancelling the ownership certificates of the two pairs of ivory and 13 ivory idols found in the possession of actor Mohanlal. A Division Bench consisting of Justice A. K. Jayasankaran Nambiar and Justice Jobin Sebastian, which declared the ownership certificates to Mr. Mohanlal as void ab initio and legally unenforceable, had held that the State government was at liberty to issue a fresh notification under Section 40 (4) of the Act, for the declaration of the wildlife trophy to persons or a class of persons. However, the new scheme is unlikely to benefit Mr. Mohanlal and others who stand accused in the cases related to the illegal possession of wildlife articles, including ivory. The actor is facing trial in the case related to the illegal possession of two sets of ivory, which were unearthed during an Income Tax raid at his Kochi residence a few years ago. Mr. Mohanlal has so far not approached the State Forest Department with any request for the declaration since the Kerala High Court order, Forest department sources said. Interestingly, the Forest department, which has booked the actor for the possession of ivory, is adopting a wait-and-watch approach regarding the illegal possession of 13 ivory idols, which were found in his possession during the Income Tax raid. Besides the two sets of ivory, Mohanlal’s possession of the idols has also become illegal since the court cancelled its ownership certificate. The legal option of challenging the High Court order before the Supreme Court is open for the actor, sources pointed out. Meanwhile, the State Board for Wildlife had last year passed an agenda seeking a further extension of the deadline for declaration of wildlife articles, according to Forest officials.

        "title": "Gold Loan Scam: PNB Manager Accused Of Stealing Customers' Gold Worth Rs 6.5 Crore",
        "content": "The contours of a major gold loan scam at a Punjab National Bank (PNB) branch at Nawalgarh in Rajasthan’s Jhunjhunu district are gradually emerging, with investigations pointing to the alleged misappropriation of more than 4 kgs of gold valued at around Rs 6.5 crore. According to investigators, the fraud took place at the bank’s Nansa Gate branch, where the then branch manager, in collusion with two associates, is accused of siphoning off gold pledged by customers as collateral for loans. Police say the accused allegedly used the proceeds to purchase high-value land parcels and establish a dairy plant. The scam came to light after tampering was detected in gold packets stored in the bank’s strong room, triggering panic among hundreds of customers who had deposited their jewellery for gold loans. As per the police report, 73 packets were found to contain fake jewellery instead of real gold, while three other packets were discovered to be underweight compared to official records. An initial internal audit by the bank revealed a shortage of 4,198 grams of gold, pegged at approximately Rs 6.5 crore. However, police officials cautioned that the actual quantum of stolen gold would be ascertained only after a comprehensive verification of all pledged assets. Investigators noted that the gold safe was secured with a dual-key system, operated jointly by then senior branch manager Amit Kumar Jangid and deputy manager Anant Prakash Chaudhary. The irregularities surfaced on January 28, when charge of the strong room was being transferred to deputy manager Seema Mehla. Following this, the incumbent branch manager initiated an internal probe, which flagged the role of the former branch manager as suspicious. Based on the bank’s complaint, police have registered a case against Amit Kumar Jangid, Anant Prakash Chaudhary, and bank business correspondent (BC) operator Santosh Kumar. Searches have revealed that Jangid acquired properties worth several crores in recent years, including land on which a dairy plant was established. Additional properties linked to the accused have been identified at multiple locations. His family reportedly resides in Sithal village of Gudhagaurji area in Jhunjhunu. The investigation has also uncovered evidence of fictitious gold loans issued from the branch. Several loan accounts were found to be in the names of non-existent individuals, with indications that fraudulent loans may also have been sanctioned under government schemes. Police officials said the total amount embezzled in the scam would be known only after the investigation is completed, adding that preliminary findings suggest the losses could be significantly higher than initially estimated.",

        "title": "Bengaluru’s 5-Year Construction Rule May Hit 68,000 Vacant BDA Plots With New Fines",
        "content": "If you own a BDA plot in Bengaluru and have been holding on to it without building a house, you may soon have to rethink your plans. The Bangalore Development Authority is considering revising penalty charges for vacant residential sites, a move that could impact tens of thousands of plot owners across the city. With more than 68,000 sites lying unused in multiple BDA layouts, authorities are now weighing stricter slab-based fines aimed at discouraging long-term land banking and encouraging timely construction. Until now, site owners were required to pay a penalty if they failed to construct a house within the permitted timeframe. However, many allottees have reportedly not paid the existing fines. In response to public demands, BDA officials are discussing a revised penalty structure that could make payments more manageable. As per existing rules, beneficiaries must construct a house within five years of allotment. The BDA had earlier planned to revise penalties by 10%, in line with guideline rates, from September 2024. However, due to low compliance, officials are now considering a slab-based penalty system. Under the proposed revision, penalties may be imposed as follows: The proposal is still under discussion and is yet to receive final approval. The BDA acquires land from farmers by paying compensation and develops layouts before allotting plots at concessional rates. However, officials have observed that several allottees purchase plots for investment purposes and delay or avoid construction for many years. Authorities state that vacant plots often create inconvenience for neighbouring residents and affect planned urban development. The penalty system is intended to discourage long-term vacancy and encourage construction within the stipulated timeframe. Earlier, BDA required house construction within two years, which was later extended to three years and then to five years. As per current regulations, if construction is not completed within the allowed period, 12.5 per cent of the site value may be deducted, and the remaining amount refunded before the plot is withdrawn. However, officials have observed cases where allottees have not built houses even after holding plots for two to three decades. Many such owners approach BDA for sale deeds later to obtain e-accounts, which reveals that construction has not taken place. In such cases, penalty charges are collected while issuing the sale deed. The BDA retains administrative control over newly developed layouts for up to ten years after allotment. During this period, some site owners construct houses, while others leave the land vacant and apply for sale deeds later. There have also been instances where plots remain vacant for up to 20 years before owners attempt to sell them. To address such situations, BDA introduced penalties for delayed construction and is now considering revising these charges according to guideline rates. Officials said that most older BDA layouts in Bengaluru continue to have vacant sites. Except for recently developed Nadaprabhu Kempegowda Layout and Arkavathi Layout, several established neighbourhoods still report unutilised plots. Vacant sites have been identified in areas including Jayanagar, BTM Layout, Banashankari, Anjanapura, HAL Layout, HBR Layout, JP Nagar, Nagarbhavi, Koramangala, HSR Layout and Indiranagar. According to BDA data, more than 68,000 plots remain vacant across 64 layouts in Bengaluru. Among these, over 20,000 sites are currently involved in various disputes. BDA Commissioner Manivannan confirmed that the revision of penalties for vacant plots was discussed during a recent management meeting. He stated that the matter will be reviewed in further detail in the upcoming meeting, after which a final decision is expected.

The President’s rule was first imposed on February 13, 2025 and later extended on August 13 for a period of six months. Yumnam Khemchand Singh, 62, is a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) politician from Manipur. He was elected to the Manipur legislative assembly from the Singjamei constituency in both the 2017 and 2022 assembly elections. He served as the Speaker of the assembly from 2017 to 2022. A taekwondo black belt, Khemchand started his political career alongside former Manipur CM N Biren Singh, who resigned last year after he was unable to maintain law and order and prevent ethnic conflict, as part of the Democratic Revolutionary People’s Party. He joined the BJP in 2013 and entered the Assembly in 2017. ALSO READ: From Taekwondo Black Belt To Manipur CM: The Rise Of Yumnam Khemchand Singh He was appointed as the Speaker of the Manipur Assembly in the first Biren Singh government. In 2022, he was inducted as a cabinet minister in the second Biren Singh ministry, holding key portfolios, including the Municipal Administration and Housing Development (MAHUD) Department, Rural Development and Panchayati Raj Department, and the Education Department. As ethnic clashes grew in Manipur, anger rose over the government’s inability to address the issue and bring the situation under control, which resulted in a grenade attack on Khemchand’s house in 2023. Despite being a cabinet minister, Khemchand became an outspoken critic of the Biren Singh government and pressured the party to seek his replacement. Biren Singh resigned on February 9, 2025, amid growing dissent within the BJP-led government and the Congress’s plans to move a no-confidence motion in the Assembly. Khemchand had earlier told News18 that Biren Singh had failed to maintain law and order in Manipur for over 18 months. Biren Singh continued as caretaker Chief Minister till President’s rule was imposed. The central government engaged ethnic bodies in talks to defuse the Manipur crisis, and PM Modi’s visit to the state in September 2025 was seen as a big step to restore normalcy. Khemchand was named as the Chief Minister of the politically sensitive state as leaders from both the Meitei and Kuki communities came together to form the government, marking a significant political coordination. The move is believed to have provided a major boost to Manipur by signalling a return to normalcy, especially with elections due next year.",

Since then, ED has filed Closure Report before the concerned Special Court in 93 cases where no offence of money-laundering is made out due to various reasons such as Closure of Schedule offence case, cases where the predicate offence Court finds no offence committed related to Schedule Offence defined under PMLA, quashing of Predicate Offence case etc,\" he said. “Prior to the aforesaid amendment (i.e. before 01.08.2019), cases where no money-laundering offence was made out were closed with the prior approval of regional Special Director of Enforcement. As such, since the inception of PMLA i.e. 01.07.2005 up to 31.07.2019, 1185 cases were closed,\" he said. The Directorate of Enforcement follows a multi-pronged approach for registering a case based on money-laundering risks and threats and by examining information received through several sources. After completion of investigation, a prosecution complaint is filed before the Special Court. Efforts have been made to fast-track investigations and conclude cases efficiently through the enhanced use of technology which includes optimum use of national and international databases, forensic tools, artificial intelligence, OSINT techniques and digital resources to strengthen evidence collection, improve analytical capabilities and expedite complex financial crime investigations.",

        "content": "NCP leader Sharad Pawar expressed happiness over Sunetra Pawar replacing her husband Ajit Pawar as Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra. Sunetra Pawar, a Rajya Sabha MP from the state, was sworn in on Saturday night. Ajit Pawar died last week in a plane crash. Sharad Pawar denied any knowledge of a memorial for his nephew on the campus of Vidya Pratishtan, the educational institution founded by the Pawar family in Baramati. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday morning, Sharad Pawar criticised Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis for speaking about a possible merger of the two NCP factions. He said merger talks were taking place between Ajit Pawar and Jayant Patil from his side and had nothing to do with Fadnavis or the BJP. “… Fadnavis was not involved in the talks. What right did he have to talk about it?\" Pawar said, adding that his focus was now on supporting his family during the tragedy. “As of now, there is no discussion about any political decisions…\" Fadnavis, however, dismissed talk of a merger, saying Ajit Pawar would have informed him and the BJP leadership if such talks had taken place.

After his death, it emerged he had been planning a family reunion by bringing the divided NCP factions together. The two factions had joined hands for municipal elections last month, which ended unsuccessfully after the BJP swept to victory. Sources told NDTV the reunion plan was still on and could be announced in the second week of February, with Sunetra Pawar seen as playing a crucial role. Sharad Pawar also spoke about the disruption in Parliament involving Rahul Gandhi reading excerpts from an unpublished book by former Army chief General MM Naravane related to the India-China border row in Ladakh in June 2020. He said Rahul Gandhi, as Leader of the Opposition, should have been allowed to speak and that there should have been an opportunity to discuss the book, as it was written by a former Army Chief and indicated a matter of concern.",

        "title": "Once-In-A-Lifetime Case: 10kg Tumour Removed From 35-Year-Old Woman In Bihar",
        "content": "A rare and alarming medical case from Samastipur district in Bihar has stunned both the public and the medical fraternity. A 35-year-old woman had been living with a mysterious lump growing inside her abdomen for a long time, which eventually weighed nearly 10 kilograms. Initially believed to be a routine health issue, her condition steadily worsened. Doctors later revealed that had she reached the hospital any later, saving her life would have been extremely difficult. The woman was identified as Savita Devi, wife of Mukesh Paswan, a resident of Ward 9, Karimanagar Panchayat, in the Mohiuddinagar block of Samastipur. According to her family, Savita Devi began experiencing severe abdominal pain and abnormal swelling around two months ago. At first, they sought local treatment, hoping the problem would subside. When her condition showed no improvement, the family began travelling in search of medical help. She was taken to Patna, Hajipur, Patori, Samastipur, Delhi, and Kolkata for consultations and diagnostic tests. During examinations at several hospitals, doctors suspected cancer, a possibility that left the family deeply distressed and fearful. Despite visiting multiple medical centres, no definitive solution was offered. With Savita Devi’s health rapidly deteriorating, the family finally decided to admit her to Muskan Seva Sadan Hospital, where her life took a dramatic turn. Doctors described her condition as critical upon arrival. Diagnostic tests and a CT scan revealed that the massive abdominal growth was pressing against other internal organs, leading to breathing difficulties, persistent pain, extreme weakness, and severe discomfort. Dr Sunil Kumar, Director of Muskan Seva Sadan Hospital, said that given the seriousness of the case, a special medical team of five doctors was immediately assembled. The team included experienced surgeons, anaesthesia specialists, and assistant physicians. A highly sensitive and high-risk operation lasting three and a half to four hours was performed, during which the 10-kilogram mass was successfully removed from her abdomen. The surgery marked a major medical achievement for the region. Following the operation, Savita Devi’s condition improved rapidly. Dr Umesh Prasad, a retired medical officer from the Bihar government, said he had never encountered such a case in his entire career. He admitted that there was considerable fear before the surgery, given the size and complexity of the tumour. However, he added that the experience, coordination, and confidence of the medical team gave everyone the courage to proceed. Savita Devi’s family expressed complete faith in the doctors and stated that they did not wish to seek treatment anywhere else. According to the medical team, had the surgery not been performed at the right time, the woman would not have survived. Doctors explained that carrying such a large abdominal tumour causes extreme pain and suffering. Thankfully, following the operation, Savita Devi is now completely safe, and her family has finally breathed a sigh of relief.",

        "content": "In November 2024, Yumnam Khemchand Singh told News18 that then chief minister N Biren Singh had failed to maintain law and order in Manipur for over 18 months and should step down. Now, in a significant political development, Singh has been declared the next chief minister of the politically sensitive state. On February 3, more than 45 MLAs of the Manipur legislative assembly reached a consensus on Singh as the next chief minister, representing the Meitei community. As part of the power-sharing arrangement, Nemcha Kipgen from the Kuki community has been named deputy chief minister, while Govindas Konthoujam will take charge as home minister. The state may get anoher deputy CM as Loss Dikho may be picked from the Naga community. Singh is likely to take the oath of office on the evening of February 4. The decision highlights a carefully worked-out political balance aimed at forming a popular and inclusive government. It marks a major breakthrough, as leaders from both the Meitei and Kuki communities have come together to form the government in an important step toward restoring political normalcy in the state. The real challenge ahead will be ensuring that both communities can jointly and effectively run the government on the ground. Singh is a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) politician from Manipur. He was elected to the Manipur legislative assembly from the Singjamei constituency in both the 2017 and 2022 assembly elections. He served as the Speaker of the assembly from 2017 to 2022. In 2022, he was inducted as a cabinet minister in the second Biren Singh ministry, holding key portfolios, including the Municipal Administration and Housing Development (MAHUD) Department, Rural Development and Panchayati Raj Department, and the Education Department. He served in this role until February 2025, when President’s Rule was imposed in Manipur. First, the coming together of Meitei and Kuki representatives to form the government is a significant political moment. Second, the formation of an elected government was the need of the hour, and this move provides a major boost to Manipur by signalling a return to normalcy, especially with elections due next year. Third, the choice of chief minister is politically significant, as Singh has been openly critical of N Biren Singh’s leadership. Speaking to News18 in 2024, Singh had remarked: “In politics, there is no friend or foe. Honestly speaking, it has been 18 months and there is no peace. I asked him to resign a couple of times, but he is not putting down his papers. He could not bring peace till now, so why isn’t he resigning?\" While this development represents a major breakthrough for Manipur, its true success will ultimately depend on how effectively the new government functions on the ground and maintains harmony between the communities.",

The launch was closely monitored by senior scientists from DRDO laboratories, including the Defence Research & Development Laboratory, High Energy Materials Research Laboratory, Research Centre Imarat, and ITR. Secretary of Defence R&D and DRDO Chairman, Dr Samir V Kamat, congratulated all teams involved in the successful flight test.

        "content": "The Union Ministry of Home Affairs on Tuesday told the Lok Sabha that Left Wing Extremism (LWE) violence in India has declined by 88 per cent since 2010 and is now confined to just eight districts across three states, following sustained security operations and targeted development measures. The Centre said its strategy combines security strengthening, rehabilitation of surrendered cadres and large-scale infrastructure expansion in former conflict areas. “The LWE perpetrated violence incidents have come down from a high of 1,936 in the year 2010 by 88 per cent to 234 in 2025,\" MHA said. “The resolute implementation of the ‘National Policy and Action Plan 2015’ has resulted in consistent decline in violence and constriction of geographical spread. LWE, which has been a serious challenge to the internal security of the nation, has been significantly curbed in recent times and has been constricted to only a few pockets. The number of LWE-affected districts reduced from 126 in 2018 to only 08 in December 2025, with only 3 districts now remaining Most LWE Affected.\" Replying to an unstarred question, Minister of State for Home Nityanand Rai said the Centre supports state governments through a surrender-cum-rehabilitation framework designed to bring former Naxal cadres into the social and economic mainstream. Under the scheme, higher-ranked cadres are provided an immediate grant of Rs 5 lakh, while other cadres receive Rs 2.5 lakh. Incentives are also offered for surrendering weapons and ammunition. The policy includes vocational training in a trade of the individual’s choice, along with a monthly stipend of Rs 10,000 for three years. Expenditure incurred by states is reimbursed under the Security Related Expenditure scheme, which also covers operational costs and compensation linked to LWE violence. Since 2014-15, Rs 3,681.73 crore has been released to affected states under this scheme. The government said it continues to assist states through deployment of Central Armed Police Forces, helicopter support, fortified security camps, intelligence sharing and modernisation of police infrastructure. Under the Special Infrastructure Scheme, works worth Rs 1,761 crore have been sanctioned to strengthen special forces and intelligence branches in LWE-affected states. So far, 656 fortified police stations have been constructed. An additional Rs 1,224.59 crore has been provided to central agencies since 2014-15 under the Assistance to Central Agencies for LWE Management scheme to support counter-insurgency infrastructure and air operations. Authorities are also focusing on choking financial networks linked to Maoist groups through coordinated action between central and state agencies. The Home Ministry said development remains central to the long-term strategy. A total of 15,016 km of roads have been built under two LWE-specific connectivity schemes. Telecommunications access has expanded with the commissioning of 9,233 mobile towers in affected areas. Skill development infrastructure includes 46 Industrial Training Institutes and 49 Skill Development Centres. In tribal regions, 179 Eklavya Model Residential Schools are now functional. Financial inclusion has been expanded through 6,025 post offices offering banking services, along with 1,804 bank branches and 1,321 ATMs in the most affected districts. Since 2017, Rs 3,953.67 crore has been released under Special Central Assistance to fill critical infrastructure gaps. The government said LWE incidents declined from a high of 1,936 in 2010 to 234 in 2025. Civilian and security force deaths fell from 1,005 in 2010 to 100 in 2025, marking a 90 per cent drop. During 2025, security forces neutralised 364 Naxals, arrested 1,022 and facilitated 2,337 surrenders. Police stations reporting LWE violence have reduced from 465 in 2010 to 119 in 2025. Currently, the eight affected districts are located in Chhattisgarh (six districts), Jharkhand (one) and Odisha (one). The government reiterated its commitment to complete eradication of Left Wing Extremism and sustained development of liberated areas.",

Police said the accused, identified as Altaf, used to supply vegetables to the hostel and allegedly lured the minor on false pretexts. According to the police, the accused sexually assaulted the girl over a period of nearly four months and threatened to kill her if she disclosed the abuse, forcing her into silence. The crime came to light after the girl’s health deteriorated and she complained of severe abdominal pain. Medical examination later revealed that she was three months pregnant. The victim is currently undergoing treatment at Hamidia Hospital in Bhopal. A case has been registered at Kohefiza police station, while the case diary has also been sent to Khurai police station in Sagar district for further investigation. The accused has been arrested. In a separate incident from the Kohefiza area, an accused arrested for allegedly raping a Class 11 student was produced before a court, where lawyers allegedly surrounded and assaulted him within the court premises. Police personnel intervened to rescue the accused, leading to a scuffle between the police and some lawyers. A video of the confrontation later surfaced. Police said the accused, identified as Osaf Ali, allegedly raped the student inside a car and later blackmailed her using objectionable videos.

Pandurang Kondamangale, a resident of Kerur village in Maharashtra’s Nanded district, was arrested for allegedly killing his daughter Prachi by pushing her into the Nizamsagar canal in Telangana’s Nizamabad area on January 29. Prachi, just six years old, was one of Pandurang’s twin daughters. He later had a son, taking his total number of children to three. Under Maharashtra’s local self-government rules, individuals with more than two children are disqualified from contesting village panchayat elections. Police say this disqualification became the biggest impediment to Pandurang’s political ambitions. Investigations have revealed that Pandurang initially attempted to give Prachi up for adoption to make himself eligible to contest the elections. “When the adoption plan failed, the accused decided to kill her,\" Telangana Police Commissioner P Sai Chaitanya said. The current head (sarpanch) of Kerur village, Ganesh Shinde, has also been arrested in connection with the case. Police allege that Shinde encouraged Pandurang to pursue his electoral ambitions and supported him despite being aware that he was legally disqualified due to having three children. The case surfaced after the body of an unidentified girl was found in the Nizamsagar canal under the jurisdiction of Bodhan rural police station in Nizamabad district. In an effort to identify the child, a police constable shared her photograph on WhatsApp. Within hours, police in Mukhed taluka of Maharashtra identified the girl as Prachi, who had been reported missing for several days. During questioning, Pandurang reportedly gave contradictory statements, raising suspicion. Mobile location data placed him in Telangana at the time of the incident.

        "title": "'The Usual Stance': Govt Source On Agri, Dairy Sectors In India-US Trade Deal Amid Debate",
        "content": "India is likely to maintain its long-standing stance of excluding sensitive agricultural products and dairy from the trade deal with the United States, a government official has said, signalling that these sectors are largely unlikely to feature in any significant market-opening commitments. “What has been the stance remains the stance. The usual stance (for sensitive items in agriculture, dairy) is likely to stay. The interests of our farmers won’t be compromised,\" the official was quoted as saying on the condition of anonymity. On Monday, US President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that the US and India had reached a trade deal, stating that the agreement would substantially reduce the reciprocal tariffs set to take effect from mid-2025. Under the terms of the deal, Trump said the US would lower its tariffs on Indian goods to 18 per cent, while duties on American products entering India are expected to drop to zero. While Trump also said India would stop buying Russian oil, sources in the Indian government said the country would stick to its “people-first approach\". “We will continue to buy oil from markets giving the best deal and from non-sanctioned entities. Our strategy will be decided by market prices.\" #BreakingNews | India’s message is clear: No compromise on farmers & dairy But what does this mean for the US–India trade deal? @GrihaAtul @_pallavighosh @payalmehta100 discuss pic.twitter.com/QrJdgRoJ89 The official said that negotiators from both sides are currently working on the documentation for the trade deal and are in discussions on the same. A large part of India’s population depends on agriculture and dairy for income and employment. Millions of small and marginal farmers rely on these sectors, especially dairy, where most producers operate on a small scale. Critics of open and free trade argue that opening these markets to imports from countries with highly subsidised and large‑scale production could undermine local producers and cause job losses in rural areas. India’s dairy farms are mostly small and less mechanised compared to large commercial operations in developed countries. Other countries (like the US, EU, Australia, or New Zealand) often subsidise their agriculture heavily, making their products very competitive globally. If India eliminated tariffs on imports from these countries, local farmers might not be able to compete. Apart from this, agriculture is closely tied to national food security. Ensuring stable production and availability of key staples protects India from global price shocks and shortages. Governments often shield staples to prevent sudden import surges that might hurt domestic food supply and prices. There is also the political angle to the row. Agriculture and dairy are politically sensitive in India, with farmers’ interests being a major political concern. Any large liberalisation that threatens their incomes can lead to strong public backlash and social unrest. This was a key reason India withdrew from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in 2019 as the government felt cheaper imports could hurt domestic crops and dairy.",

        "title": "'India Has Many Options': Govt Sources Reject Criticism Over Trade Deal With US",
        "content": "India now has “many options\" on trade and exports, government sources told CNN-News18 on Tuesday, pushing back against the Opposition criticism over the newly-announced trade deal with the United States. The remarks came amid debates that the 18 per cent tariff rate announced under the new agreement with the United States was still too high. According to the sources, New Delhi has followed a two-pronged strategy in recent years, seeking access to new markets while simultaneously promoting a wider basket of export products. They said the series of free trade agreements signed with other countries has diversified India’s commercial partners and reduced dependence on any single market. As political reactions over the India-US trade deal continued, it spiralled into Parliament, triggering sharp scenes in the Lok Sabha. Opposition MPs protested soon after the House assembled, objecting to the tariff announcement by US President Donald Trump following his phone call with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as well as to other pending disputes. Speaker Om Birla repeatedly appealed for order as he attempted to make obituary references, but members trooped into the well, raising slogans such as “Surrender Modi\". Birla described the disruptions as a “planned manner\" of stalling proceedings and underlined that Question Hour was a crucial opportunity for the Opposition to hold the government to account before adjourning the House for nearly an hour. The ruckus also drew on Monday’s confrontation, when Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tried to quote from an unpublished memoir of former Army chief MM Naravane relating to the 2020 India-China standoff. Birla disallowed the reference, but Gandhi persisted, escalating tensions on the floor. Meanwhile, in the Rajya Sabha, MP JP Nadda accused the Opposition of reading negativity into what he framed as a diplomatic and economic gain. Referring to Trump’s announcement, Nadda said the US President had informed India about the agreement the previous night and added, He went on to remark, “They have a habit of seeing bad things in good,\" while assuring members that the government would soon place full details of the trade pact before Parliament. Nadda said the concerned minister would discuss the matter and that a statement would be made shortly, declaring, “On behalf of the government, I can assure you that the government will give all the details on the trade.\" He further charged that Congress and the INDI Alliance were behaving irresponsibly, adding, “What you are saying has been proved wrong.\" The trade deal at the heart of the row envisages Washington lowering reciprocal tariffs on Indian goods to 18 per cent. PM Modi welcomed the development, saying he was delighted that “Made in India\" products would face reduced duties and thanking Trump on behalf of India’s population for the move.",

        "title": "What Next For India-US Trade Deal? Talks For Broader Agreement Continue",
        "content": "President Donald Trump said on Monday that the United States and India have reached a trade deal that will reduce tariffs on Indian goods. Under the agreement, Washington will lower its reciprocal tariff on Indian goods to 18 per cent and remove the additional 25 per cent penalty imposed over India’s purchase of Russian oil. In return Trump has said India will reduce its tariffs on US products to 0 per cent. Although, no official document has been released outlining the terms of the deal. A Reuters report said the agreement includes some agriculture products. Agriculture had earlier been a major point of disagreement, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi refusing to open the Indian market to US farm products. After the new US-India deal was announced, US Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said it will open India’s vast market to more American farm products. She said this could raise prices for US farmers and boost rural incomes. Rollins noted that America’s agricultural trade deficit with India stood at $1.3 billion in 2024 and called the deal an “America First\" win. “Thank you @POTUS for ONCE AGAIN delivering for our American farmers. New US-India deal will export more American farm products to India’s massive market, lifting prices, and pumping cash into rural America . In 2024, America’s agricultural trade deficit with India was $1.3 billion. India’s growing population is an important market for American agricultural products and today’s deal will go a long way to reducing this deficit. America First victory on top of the dozens of deals for agri,\" reads her post on X. The report also said Washington asked India to cut high tariffs in sectors such as automobiles. It added that India has agreed to buy US goods including petroleum, defence equipment, electronics, pharma products, telecom products and aircraft. Trump, who called Modi “one of my greatest friends,\" said India agreed to cut its tariffs on US goods to zero and remove non-tariff barriers. He also said India has committed to stop buying oil from Russia and reduce tariffs to zero as part of the understanding. However, India has not officially confirmed these details. The exact terms remain unclear as information is currently coming from statements made by US officials. An Indian official quoted by Reuters said talks will continue for a more comprehensive agreement covering additional sectors. The report repeated that the deal includes some agriculture products and addresses US demands for tariff cuts in sectors such as automobiles. India’s reported commitment to buy US goods includes petroleum, defence, electronics, pharma, telecom products and aircraft. In the absence of a formal joint statement, there is uncertainty over what both sides have agreed to. India has not clarified its position on buying Russian oil or purchasing $500 billion worth of US goods. Still, the reduction of a 50 per cent US tariff on India to 18 per cent is seen as significant. Trump said India has committed to buy $500 billion worth of US energy, technology, agriculture and coal. Lower US tariffs could help Indian exporters by reducing cost barriers in the American market. Sectors such as textiles, apparel, seafood, chemicals and auto components may benefit. With tariffs lowered to 18 per cent, India could be better placed than countries like Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia in some US markets. Despite Trump’s announcement, Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) has urged caution. Its founder Ajay Srivastava said, “Caution, not celebration, is warranted.\" He noted that Trump’s remarks did not clearly specify which goods would see tariff and non-tariff barrier removal. GTRI pointed out that India has traditionally resisted opening sensitive sectors such as food grains and genetically modified products. Meanwhile, after Trump said India would buy more than $500 billion worth of US goods, GTRI observed that India’s current annual imports from the US are below $50 billion, suggesting that reaching $500 billion would take more than 20 years and may be a long-term target rather than a firm commitment. Srivastava said the lack of clear details makes it difficult to treat the announcement as a concluded trade deal. “Trade deals are serious business. Until there is a joint statement, negotiated text, and clarity on enforceability, this should be treated as a political signal, not a concluded trade deal. Caution, not celebration, is warranted,\" he said.",

        "content": "As Ayushman Bharat grows into one of the world’s largest health insurance programmes, the scrutiny of claims is intensifying, a government report shows. Tighter fraud detection under the Narendra Modi government’s flagship health insurance scheme, Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana, has led to suspicious claims worth Rs 272 crore being flagged, with Rs 133.6 crore rejected before payment, according to the latest government data. The measures, outlined in the annual report of the National Health Authority for the year 2024-25, seen by News18, are claimed to be aimed at safeguarding the scheme’s integrity as its scale and reach expand rapidly. Between September 2023 and March 2025, authorities deployed 61 trigger-based techniques to identify irregularities, including 14 tools based on artificial intelligence, machine learning, image analytics and optical character recognition. During this period, the report said, over 4.63 lakh suspicious claims were shared with states for further investigation. The report says these interventions have helped contain potential losses and strengthen trust in the programme. Oversight mechanisms have also been reinforced, the report claimed. A transaction-based analytical dashboard has been rolled out, while 2,283 desk medical audits have been conducted across states. In addition, the National Anti-Fraud Unit has carried out around 120 joint field medical audits across multiple states and Union Territories, with suspicious hospitals and entities referred to state authorities for action. The document underlines that institutionalising a robust anti-fraud framework will be “central to sustaining the programme’s credibility\". “Going forward, predictive analytics, real-time monitoring, and automated checks to proactively detect, deter, and address suspicious activities and fraudulent claims will be further strengthened,\" it said. Some of the latest initiatives include a multi-layered anti-fraud model in Madhya Pradesh, a cross-district flying squads for fraud detection in Haryana, home visits by audit teams and flying squads in Punjab, a hospital visit monitoring system (HVMS) for real-time audit tracking in Gujarat and geo-tagged verification of beneficiaries in Manipur. Hospital admissions under AB PM-JAY have risen more than 50 times since the scheme’s launch, the government data shows. According to the report, admissions climbed from 18 lakh in 2018–19 to 9.19 crore by March 31, 2025, reflecting rising confidence and reliance on the government-funded health insurance programme among eligible beneficiaries. The scale-up has accelerated in recent years. In 2024–25, 2.4 crore hospitalisations were recorded under the scheme, with claims amounting to over Rs 38,000 crore, highlighting its “pivotal role\" in financing secondary and tertiary care for millions of low-income families. Beyond volumes, official data point to a gradual narrowing of gender gaps in access to healthcare. The share of women beneficiaries has increased from 47 per cent in 2019–20 to 50 percent in 2024–25. “AB PM-JAY has not only provided quality healthcare, but it has also emerged as a tool for reducing gender disparities in accessing healthcare services,\" the report said. Several states and Union Territories have reported higher utilisation rates among women than men, indicating progress towards more equitable access across genders. The data shows women have used the scheme more than men in Goa, Puducherry, Maharashtra, Sikkim, Bihar, Chandigarh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Kerala, Gujarat, and several other states. The report highlighted “the progressively narrowing of the gender gap in healthcare access across states\", calling it evidence of the scheme’s success in promoting inclusivity and addressing long-standing inequities. Looking ahead, the report said the government has identified “100 per cent saturation of Ayushman cards\" across all implementing states and Union Territories as a key priority. “Achieving 100% saturation of Ayushman cards across all implementing States and Union Territories continues to be a key priority,\" the report said. “Targeted efforts will be undertaken to identify and enroll all eligible beneficiaries, particularly in remote and underserved areas, to ensure equitable access to healthcare benefits under the scheme.\"",

What appears on the surface as a calendar crowded with ceremonial state visits and summits is a carefully orchestrated grand strategy to position India as the indispensable link between the Global South and the architecture of tomorrow’s technological and security orders. The diplomatic hubba-bubba starts modestly on February 5, with President Patrick Herminie of Seychelles. Herminie’s visit marks his first journey to India since assuming office last October, and it coincides precisely with the fiftieth anniversary of India-Seychelles diplomatic relations. Over 35,000 people have registered for the India AI Impact Summit, with attendees from more than 100 countries expected in New Delhi from February 16-20. PM Modi will also play host to Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and French President Emmanuel Macron. Beyond these, PM Modi’s visit to Israel on February 27–28 is imminent. Rumours are that a trip to Malaysia may also be on the cards, after missing out on the ASEAN summit last year due to domestic commitments. By February 19, PM Modi and the world’s attention will converge on New Delhi’s Bharat Mandapam for the India AI Impact Summit. The India AI Impact Summit represents the most consequential of Modi’s February commitments. It is no ordinary conference. It will be the first global artificial intelligence summit ever hosted in the Global South. Its theme: Sarvajana Hitaya, Sarvajana Sukhaya, welfare for all, happiness for all, projects the vision of technology as a democratising force rather than a stratifying one. India’s motivation is both ideological and strategic. The Modi government has committed Rs 10,300 crore through its IndiaAI Mission to build domestic capacity in artificial intelligence, centered on indigenous solutions tailored to Indian conditions. The strategy rests on a principle that distinguishes it from prior eras of technology adoption: Eras where imitation served as the blueprint for success in the country. The technologies India develops must serve India first, then the Global South, and finally the world. This logic underpins the creation of nearly 570 artificial intelligence training labs distributed across the country, each designed to democratise access to AI capabilities rather than concentrate them among elite institutions or foreign corporations. The summit itself will produce more than 15 substantive deliverables, moving the conversation away from the largely declaratory AI governance discussions that have characterised earlier forums, the Bletchley Park summit in the UK, Seoul’s summit in South Korea, and Paris’s forum in 2025. India’s approach will emphasise implementation; how AI can improve healthcare in rural areas, enhance agricultural productivity for smallholder farmers, and strengthen governance through data-driven policymaking. The summit’s guest list amplifies this message. French President Emmanuel Macron confirmed his attendance specifically to honour India’s co-chairmanship of global AI discussions and to underscore the strategic alignment between France and India on technological sovereignty. Brazilian President Lula’s attendance carries additional weight, signalling BRICS solidarity at a moment when tariff tensions and economic nationalism threaten the unity of the Global South. The presence of over one hundred global chief executives, from OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Meta, and other technology giants, alongside ministers from more than fifteen nations, creates a rare space where policy and commercial interests meet on India’s terms. For PM Modi, the summit legitimises India’s investment in building AI research ecosystems and validates the government’s decision to position India not as a consumer of foreign artificial intelligence but as an architect of its own. Internationally, it signals that India intends to exercise influence over the norms, ethics, and governance frameworks that will govern AI deployment globally. On February 19, Macron will arrive in New Delhi with an agenda that extends far beyond the AI summit’s public sessions. The centrepiece of defence industrial cooperation is going to overshadow every niche agreement that the countries will make. India’s Defence Procurement Board cleared a proposal in mid-January 2026 to acquire 114 additional Rafale fighter jets from Dassault Aviation in what would become India’s largest-ever defence procurement. The deal, valued at approximately Rs 3.25 lakh crore, represents a strategic pivot in how India approaches defence manufacturing: instead of buying off-the-shelf aircraft, India will domestically manufacture approximately 80 to 96 Rafales with up to 60 per cent indigenous content, whilst receiving 18 aircraft in fly-away condition from France beginning in 2030. Macron’s visit is expected to crystallise this agreement. Tata Advanced Systems has already begun constructing a final assembly line for Rafale fuselages in Hyderabad, with production scheduled to commence in 2028. HAL and Safran are negotiating a joint engine production facility, also in Hyderabad, whilst an MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul) hub is planned near Jewar in Uttar Pradesh. If formalised during Macron’s February visit, the French President himself indicated to his diplomatic corps in January that defence industrial cooperation would feature prominently in bilateral talks. Another major point of discussion has been that the February visit would advance cooperation on rare earth minerals. India’s 2026 budget announcement of dedicated rare earth corridors across Odisha, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu signals India’s intent to scale this effort rapidly. Macron’s endorsement during his February visit will lend European institutional weight to India’s bid to become a centre for rare earth processing and advanced materials manufacturing. Lula’s state visit from February 19 to 21 is also important. The Brazilian president confirmed in a 45-minute telephone call with Modi on January 22 his intention not merely to attend the AI Impact Summit but to conduct a comprehensive bilateral review spanning defence, trade, health, science and technology, energy, biofuels, and critically, rare earths and mineral processing. Trump’s unilateral tariffs have disrupted supply chains across both nations, with India and Brazil jointly accounting for nearly $30 billion in bilateral trade. The Brazil-India Business Forum, scheduled for February 21, will bring private sector leaders from both countries to discuss infrastructure development, financial services, and technology partnerships. More strategically, Lula’s visit arrives as India and Brazil coordinate BRICS responses to Western protectionism. Lula will also inaugurate ApexBrasil’s New Delhi office during his visit, institutionalising Brazil’s commercial presence in India PM Modi is set to visit Israel on February 27–28. Israeli officials, including Ambassador Reuven Azar, have publicly affirmed that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has extended an invitation and that preparations are underway, while Indian sources have characterised the trip as advancing a “rapidly expanding strategic partnership. In remarks to Indian media, Ambassador Azar stressed that Israel hopes “to see him [Modi] as soon as possible\". This will be PM Modi’s first visit to the country in nine years, a gap that underscores the complexity of Indo-Israeli relations within the context of India’s broader West Asian strategy. The immediate driver of the visit is the launch of formal negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement. In November 2025, India and Israel signed Terms of Reference to initiate structured FTA talks. The talks are expected to address bilateral trade, which stood at $3.62 billion in 2024–25, with India serving as Israel’s second-largest Asian trading partner. Recent trends suggest the relationship has cooled slightly, with Indian exports to Israel declining 52 per cent from $4.52 billion in 2023–24 to $2.14 billion in 2024–25. An FTA is designed to reverse this trend by reducing tariff barriers and facilitating greater commerce in areas where complementarities are strongest. The centrepiece of Modi’s bilateral engagement with Netanyahu will be formalising India-Israel defence industrial cooperation. In November 2025, the two nations signed a comprehensive Memorandum of Understanding on Defence Cooperation that establishes frameworks for technology sharing, co-development, and co-production of advanced defence systems. The MoU identifies strategic dialogues, military training, defence-industrial partnerships, and collaboration in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, unmanned systems, and research and development as priority areas. Israeli defence firms, such as Rafael Advanced Defence Systems, Israel Aerospace Industries, and Elbit Systems, have begun positioning India as a manufacturing hub for exports across the Indo-Pacific. India’s Belrise group has partnered with Plasan to manufacture the ATEMM, with deliveries starting in September 2026. During Modi’s visit, additional joint manufacturing ventures are expected to be announced, including potential partnerships in unmanned aerial systems, cyber defence platforms, and advanced radar systems. The prime minister’s visit occurs against the backdrop of Middle Eastern turbulence. PM Modi and Netanyahu have held two telephone conversations in recent months, reaffirming a zero-tolerance stance against terrorism and discussing regional developments, including the Gaza Peace Plan. The visit also gives momentum to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), a connectivity initiative unveiled at the G20 Summit in Delhi in November 2023. President Herminie’s visit to India, though less dramatic than the others, completes PM Modi’s February strategy. According to the Ministry of External Affairs, he will meet President Droupadi Murmu and hold wide-ranging talks with PM Modi on bilateral, regional, and international issues, while also travelling to Chennai and Mumbai for business-focused events. The Seychelles is central to India’s “MAHASAGAR\" doctrine. New Delhi has gone out of its way to describe Seychelles as a “key maritime neighbour\" that holds a “special place\" in the doctrine. Its maritime domain and 1.4 million sq km exclusive economic zone make it central to regional maritime security, blue economy development and marine conservation. It also encompasses crucial shipping lanes, and its ports are potential node points for Indian naval operations and commercial activity. Over the past year, the MAHASAGAR initiative has been implemented through joint naval exercises and dialogues, most notably the AIKEYME exercise with ten African littoral states, including Seychelles India has invested substantially in Seychelles’ development, funding the construction of radar systems, gifting naval vessels, and supporting infrastructure projects. The relationship reflects India’s broader Indian Ocean strategy: to position itself as the region’s net security provider and development partner, ensuring that great-power rivalry does not destabilise the waters through which much of global commerce flows. The visit allows Modi to reinforce these bonds while signalling India’s long-term commitment to the Indian Ocean as India’s sphere of strategic interest. PM Modi’s February calendar, taken as a whole, reveals the architecture of an India that is attempting to be simultaneously a technology leader, a manufacturing hub, a diplomatic bridge between the Global South and the West, and a guardian of its Indian Ocean neighbourhood. What ties these journeys together is not rhetoric about multipolarity or Global South solidarity, though PM Modi will certainly invoke both. Rather, it is a series of concrete interests pursued through bilateral engagement: defence partnerships, trade agreements, semiconductor ecosystems, artificial intelligence governance frameworks, and regional stability.",

        "content": "India-US Trade Deal Updates: Union Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal on Tuesday said that at no point has Prime Minister Narendra Modi allowed any compromise on the interests of farmers or those associated with agriculture and the dairy sector.

He praised PM Modi for ensuring that the country’s long-term interests were kept at the forefront during negotiations. US President Donald Trump on Monday announced that the United States and India have reached a trade deal to lower reciprocal tariffs. He said that following a phone call with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the US would reduce tariffs on Indian goods from 25 per cent to 18 per cent with immediate effect. In return, Trump claimed India would cut its tariffs and non-tariff barriers on US products to “zero.” In a post on Truth Social, Trump described PM Modi as a close friend and a respected leader, adding that India had also agreed to “stop buying Russian Oil” and increase energy purchases from the US.

Union Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal on Tuesday launched a sharp attack against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over his criticism of the recently announced India-US trade agreement, accusing him of “misleading the nation” and displaying “double standards” on key national issues. Speaking at the press briefing, Union Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said at no point has the Prime Minister allowed any compromise on the interests of farmers or those associated with the agriculture and dairy sectors while making the deal with the US. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has always protected the agriculture and dairy sectors and ensured their interests are not compromised.

Union Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal slammed Rahul Gandhi and the opposition for disrupting Parliament, saying he would have preferred to discuss the India–US trade deal there. “The way the opposition, especially the Congress party under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi and their allies the DMK, TMC, and Samajwadi Party, behaved so disgracefully in Parliament today. They even reached the Speaker’s chair and insulted him. I strongly condemn the opposition and Rahul Gandhi, because of whom we have come here today to give you this information instead of speaking in Parliament,” the minister said. Union Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal praised the India–US trade deal, saying it is a major achievement for the country. “Keeping the national interest and public interest at the forefront, a trade deal that will enhance the future of a strong India has been finalised last night under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” Goyal said at the press briefing.

        "content": "The Centre has acknowledged the water contamination incident in Indore’s Bhagirath Pura and is assisting states through financial and technical schemes such as AMRUT and AMRUT 2.0, the Rajya Sabha was informed on Monday. In a written response to a query, Union Minister of State for Housing and Urban Affairs Tokhan Sahu stated that the region has ageing pipelines from 1997, noting that “some of it is damaged, so the municipal administration identified the old stretches of pipeline and included them under AMRUT 2.0\". Several people in Bhagirath Pura have succumbed to diarrhoea and vomiting since the end of December. The minister highlighted that the Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) has initiated four water supply projects for the city under AMRUT 2.0. Execution of Package-1 has commenced, while the remaining three packages are awaiting approval. The initiative addresses the entire water supply chain, including comprehensive overhauling, augmentation, and modernisation of the existing system. This encompasses source development, treatment, conveyance, storage, and citywide distribution. All packages include system integration, commissioning, and long-term operation and maintenance to ensure a safe, reliable, and sustainable drinking water supply for the urban area. Sahu emphasised that water management is a state responsibility, with the Union government providing supplementary support through advisories and infrastructure funding. The state government has implemented standard operating procedures (SOPs) for urban local bodies to prevent water contamination. “About 14,181 leakages were detected to date, with 12,634 of them repaired. Out of 3,298 overhead tanks, 3,109 have been cleaned. “Similarly, out of 21,215 tubewells, 179 were found polluted and 86 were closed for use. Regular water quality testing is ensured. Of the 80,976 samples tested, 656 failed, and action was taken at 588 points where pollution was detected,\" Sahu reported. The state government informed that under AMRUT, three drinking water supply schemes worth Rs 541 crore and two sewerage schemes worth Rs 278 crore were executed for Indore city. Additionally, under AMRUT 2.0, two water supply schemes worth Rs 1,142 crore and four sewerage schemes worth Rs 534 crore have been sanctioned. The municipal corporation is also implementing two water supply schemes worth Rs 1,121.54 crore.",

        "title": "'Credit Goes To President Trump And PM Modi': Sergio Gor To News18 On US-India Trade Deal",
        "content": "In a major diplomatic and economic breakthrough, US President Donald Trump announced on Monday that the United States and India have finalised a landmark trade agreement, marked by a significant reduction in reciprocal tariffs. The deal was preceded by a high-stakes phone call between President Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, an interaction teased earlier in the day by the newly appointed US Ambassador to India, Sergio Gor. Speaking with CNN-News18, Gor said, “The credit goes to President Trump and Prime Minister Modi…The two leaders have a great personal relationship is something that carries this deal forward. The potential between India and the United States is limitless.\" He also confirmed that India is now set to only pay 18% tariffs. “The President has a great relationship with the Prime Minister. That is why this happened,\" he said. The role of Sergio Gor in this breakthrough cannot be overstated. A longtime Trump loyalist and former Director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, Gor took charge as the US Ambassador to India on January 12, 2026. His appointment was a clear signal from Washington that the White House intended to place a “human-in-the-loop\" who possessed a direct line to the Oval Office. Things have moved very fast since Sergio Gor arrived in Delhi. We’ve seen lots of positive messaging, high level engagements, and key breakthroughs (Pax Silica invite and now trade deal). Gor, who has the ear of the President in a big way, appears to be the difference maker here.— Michael Kugelman (@MichaelKugelman) February 2, 2026 Credit where credit is due: Negotiating an end to punitive U.S. tariffs, and ending up with a better rate than competitors such as Vietnam and Bangladesh, is a major diplomatic/economic win for the Modi government. Also a great start to @USAmbIndia Sergio Gor’s tenure in India. https://t.co/FeAVRkkm6P— Sadanand Dhume (@dhume) February 2, 2026 Since his arrival in New Delhi, Gor has functioned as a strategic “bridge\", consistently framing the trade negotiations not merely as a ledger of exports but as a reflection of the personal “friendship and respect\" between the two leaders. Following the President’s announcement, Gor took to X to reiterate this sentiment: “As I have said many times, President Trump genuinely considers Prime Minister Modi a great friend! Thrilled by the news of the trade deal this evening. The relationship between the United States and India has LIMITLESS POTENTIAL!\" The core of the agreement centres on a de-escalation of the “tariff war\" that had strained bilateral ties throughout 2025. The Reduction: The United States has agreed to immediately lower its reciprocal tariff on Indian exports from 25 per cent to 18 per cent. This provides massive relief to Indian sectors such as textiles, engineering goods, and automobiles, which had been reeling under punitive duties. The Reciprocity: In exchange, President Trump claimed that India has committed to moving towards zero tariffs and non-tariff barriers on US products, specifically targeting the dairy, agriculture, and high-tech sectors. Beyond traditional trade, the deal includes a massive geopolitical shift. According to the White House, Prime Minister Modi has committed to a “Buy American\" policy exceeding $500 billion. This includes future purchases of US energy (LNG and coal), technology, and agricultural products. Significantly, the deal appears to have a “security-for-trade\" component. President Trump stated that India has agreed to stop purchasing Russian oil—a major point of contention in Washington—and will instead increase imports from the US and potentially Venezuela. Trump suggested this pivot would “help end the war in Ukraine\" by further isolating the Russian economy. This agreement marks a dramatic turnaround from late 2025, when the Trump administration had doubled tariffs on Indian goods to 50 per cent over New Delhi’s continued energy ties with Moscow. The swift resolution within the first month of 2026—and shortly after the presentation of India’s Union Budget—highlights a pragmatic shift. By deploying Sergio Gor, a trusted aide who “gets things done,\" the US administration has replaced its earlier protectionist rhetoric with a “friendship-led\" economic alliance that aims to redefine the global trade map for the next decade.",

        "title": "Census 2027 Introduces Digital-First System With New Training And Coding Framework",
        "content": "Census 2027 will operate on a fully digital backbone, marking a structural shift from earlier paper-heavy exercises. An official circular describes the upcoming census as a system built around mobile platforms, centralised portals, and live monitoring, calling it a modernisation of the country’s administrative data machinery. The document states the census will use “mobile applications for data collection, Self-Enumeration, Census Management and Monitoring System (CMMS) and Housing Listing Block Creation (HLBC) web portals and real-time data transmission\". It presents the digital architecture as a core feature rather than an add-on, linking training, supervision, and field operations into one national platform. Alongside the technology rollout, a new nationwide location coding structure has been formalised. The coding circular defines the system as “a simple and unique number by which every area… can be identified\" and describes it as “the key identifying factor at the time of data processing\". The framework assigns structured identifiers from states down to enumeration blocks to ensure uniform digital mapping. The training framework introduces a standardised cascade model across the country. National trainers will prepare master trainers, who will train field trainers responsible for enumerators and supervisors. The circular says the goal is to build a “highly skilled and motivated workforce capable of executing a seamless, accurate, and trustworthy Census\", with emphasis on digital proficiency and inclusive data practices. The guidelines add that the house listing and housing phase “forms the foundation of the census\" and require a “clear and uniform understanding of Census concepts and questions\". Training modules stress professionalism and instruct staff to handle sensitive information “with professionalism and Seva Bhav\". The coding system preserves continuity with Census 2011 while incorporating new administrative units. Existing areas retain earlier identifiers, while newly created districts and states receive incremental short codes generated through a centralised jurisdiction portal. The circular assigns separate numeric bands for villages, forest villages, statutory towns, and census towns to prevent duplication. Urban wards will be numbered in continuous sequence beginning from “0001\", and outgrowth settlements adjoining towns will receive incremental codes linked to their parent units. The circular frames this structure as essential for consistent national sequencing and smooth digital processing. Together, the circulars outline a census architecture that integrates training, geography, and monitoring into a single digital ecosystem. The documents present Census 2027 as a coordinated system designed to standardise field practices, automate administrative tracking, and improve accuracy at scale. The training circular also prescribes strict timelines and infrastructure standards. It schedules nationwide instruction between April and September 2026 and requires that all enumerator and supervisor training be completed at least one week before field operations begin. Batch sizes, classroom duration, and venue facilities, including electricity, internet connectivity, and audiovisual equipment, are standardised to maintain uniform quality. Attendance and progress will be tracked digitally through the CMMS portal, making training itself part of the real-time monitoring system that will govern Census 2027 operations.",

        "title": "Budget 2026 Aims For Stability And Growth: FM Nirmala Sitharaman To News18 | Full Interview",
        "content": "Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in an exclusive interview with Network18 Group Editor-in-Chief Rahul Joshi on Monday, spoke about the Budget 2026. While Sitharaman gave an insight into the rationale behind the moves introduced in the Budget announced on Sunday, she responded to the criticism and politics. Q: Nirmala ji, thank you so much for giving us the first exclusive interview after the Budget. You have been very kind to us every year, and thank you so much for that. Millions of people are watching you across India through CNBC-TV18, CNN, and our News18 channels across the country. First of all, congratulations on what is your ninth consecutive Budget. No other Finance Minister (FM) has done it consecutively so many times. I think it has also been a period marked by a lot of turbulence. You have seen it all: you have seen the pandemic, you have seen some shooting wars, and now tariff wars. And through it all, you have steered the economy. I think if you look at the bigger picture, a job very well done indeed. It is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world — any consequential economy in the world. You have managed to keep fiscal discipline under check. You have also kept inflation well below 2%. So the big picture is really looking good. I will ask my first question, which I always do when I start. If you look at the reactions to the Budget, some people have called it a “status quoist\" Budget. People have called it a conservative, cautious Budget. How do you react to this — people saying “no bold reforms\" this time? Of course, much is there in the fine print, and it is all coming out… the markets have come back today. So what was weighing on your mind when you were preparing this Budget? A: Nonetheless, as was observed by you and by domain experts — not just in India, even outside — the Indian economy’s fundamentals are absolutely strong. It is the global uncertainties, which, of course, always, every government has faced global uncertainties of different orders and different levels. But now the extent to which global uncertainties are bearing on countries and impacting decision-making is of an order that we have never seen before. So certainly, we had to keep that uncertainty in mind and plan for what is going to happen this year and what is going to commence in the next five years from this year, in that a new Finance Commission cycle starts. And above all, like the Honorable Prime Minister said, this is going to be the first Budget in the second quarter of the 21st century, which is up to 2050. In between, closer to 2050 is 2047, when ‘Viksit Bharat’ will have to be achieved. So, our direction, our goals are all set. #FMToNews18 | It is not on all STTs, only on futures and options. It is not for revenue. 90% of people who have gone into F&O have lost money. We have tried bringing deterrent: FM @nsitharaman to @18RahulJoshi on STT #Budget2026 #BudgetWithNews18LIVE: https://t.co/Z5J3NSMECC pic.twitter.com/uwz75gbhS3 So it was for us to — keeping in mind the global uncertainties — plan for: one, this year; two, the entire Finance Commission cycle; and three, leading up to Viksit Bharat, how do we want to take it forward. That is why, slightly differently from every other Budget, this time a lot more was said through Part B. Which actually is unusual because it is not just the tax proposals taking us towards 2047. It also shows how we want the administration to respond, whether it is tax administration largely, or how the fiscal policy and other things are derived from it. And that is why I think regarding this Budget, everyone is welcome to have their view, and I respect that. I try to understand why a certain perspective has come out. Even if it is criticising, I try to understand the basis from where they have come. But to have had the Indian economy grow at the fastest rate from among major large economies — not just one year, not just two years, but now for a steady four years — it is the stability point that I want to underline. The Prime Minister’s political stability, because he is in the third term, and also his understanding of how you respond to business, has remained the same always. We have to be receptive, we have to enable, and we have to extend a red carpet, but remove the red tape simultaneously and ease of doing business — these are consistent policies. Tax certainty brings stability for businesses. These have been the core beliefs; it is almost a code for him. And that is why, remaining in his third term, he has given the message of stability through this Budget. Just one last line on this particular observation is: stability, and also making sure businesses are able to do business in India at a time when global uncertainty is making decisions difficult for even businesses from outside to come into India. So we are clearly projecting India as a place where business can be done, and the large Indian consumer market will have to find its own higher levels of achievements — so, opportunities for them. So that is, I think, therefore, this message. So, “vision\", “searching for vision\", or saying “this Budget has no vision\" is, I think, not understanding the perspective with which we are coming. And one last point here: Budget and aside from the Budget, reforms continue. We have done several reforms not through the Budget, but yet outside of it through the year. That is why the expression ‘Reform Express’. It is continuing to move and move at a good pace. So not just the Budget, please look at the performance. Q: No, you have done that with Goods and Services Tax (GST) rationalisation, which was outside the Budget—a bold reform there. I think there are reforms here as well. What would you consider as some of the signature highlights of this Budget? A: The customs overhaul. Several of them have been mentioned in this Budget, but there are several which could not be mentioned for want of time. There are also a few more that will carry on further. So the complete overhaul of customs is a major signature reform. And looking at the frontier areas — investing in them and promoting R&D. Q: You are projecting a nominal GDP growth of 10 per cent. What is your outlook for inflation, and your estimate for real GDP in 2026-27? A: I think we have indicated it very clearly in the Budget. I am very sure that inflation will remain within the tolerance band, and therefore inflation doesn’t have to worry us much. And everything, therefore, looks at it from the point of view that if there is a deflator which is going to remain low and stable, which is going to have an impact on your estimates. Q: If you look at GDP growth in the last two quarters, 8 per cent has been impressive. Do you think we can sustain this, like China did for many years — an 8 per cent growth? Do you think India can do that in the longer term, to be able to grow at the clip that we are hoping it to achieve? A: Yes. And that is why the stability of the government, and the policies of the government, matter. Q. What is feasible for India, considering that the nominal GDP has been on a decline since FY22? Where do you see the nominal GDP going in the next couple of years? A: I strongly believe once the fund flows come in because all other factors are strong, all other factors have really been the strength of India. So your macroeconomic is complete…two days ago, we had this news report saying foreign exchange reserves have touched and crossed 700 billion. So, you have every indicator doing well. So what is that one thing which can make a difference? That one factor which can make a difference – and this is common knowledge – is if there are more funds flowing into India, that itself will give us a big relief. And, for that, those who went out also went out booking profits. So, India will have to draw a lot more funds for investments in India. Q: We’ll come to fund flows in a little while. An interesting thing that I noticed – World of Statistics says that China contributes 26 per cent of GDP growth in the world, global GDP growth; India contributes 17 per cent. So, overall, put together, we are 43 percent. The US has done a mere 9.9 percent. Elon Musk had an observation here: he said that the balance of power is shifting. Would you agree with that, and how soon can we close the gap with China? A: It is the truth that China and India together contribute so much. That’s a fact. For India to aspire to bridge the gap, yes, we have to work very hard. And there are sectors which will have to be given greater stimulus. Productivity gains will have to arise out of using technology. Our manpower should also get better deployed in the areas in which their skills lie. Yes, we have a lot of work to do. And we will have to do it. So – and that is where my trust and faith is – when the government is stable and when forward-looking policies are encouraged, we can still achieve it. Q: Stability has been your big message this time. The tax holiday for data centres has been a bold reform this time. What response do you expect from this? And would it also apply to Indian companies like TCS? A: See, we are talking about global companies setting up GCCs (global capability centre). Global companies, if they are Indian in origin, will also have to have their profits and other things understood – global profits, profits made in India and most of these global companies, who are setting up business in India, are already also paying tax. It is not as if they are not being covered by taxation for the earnings that they get from India. So, if anyone who fits into this definition – not just this, we’ve very clearly defined it. Referring to that definition, whoever fits in will get it. Q: So an Indian company like TCS might fit into that definition. Q: Before I go forward, I would like to take, you know, what the opposition feels about the budget. So, Rahul Gandhi has always been very critical of the economy and what you have been doing. You know, when Donald Trump talked about India as a dead economy, he chimed in immediately. In this Budget, he says that the Finance Minister is blind to the realities facing the government. How do you react to this? A: He is the leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha. I want to take him seriously, and I want to take his observations seriously to see if things can be done better. But most often, I think he shoots from his hip. He doesn’t keep good foundational data and then make an observation. I think on the “dead economy\" comment — I’m not referring to anybody else, but being in India, being in the Parliament, being the leader of the opposition, hearing all the questions being asked during question hours, replies being given, written, standing up ministers… that one comment in his haste, voicing the comment made by somebody else from outside… you are a member of Parliament, you are the leader of the Opposition. Are you saying you are living in a dead economy? That itself sort of pulls the carpet from under his feet. You need an Opposition leader who speaks with data and with such heft that the government will have to answer you. Now, when you speak sometimes without any kind of basis, I want to respond to him, but what do I respond on? You are speaking out of thin air. India deserves a better Opposition party. I am not commenting on individuals. The party should do a lot of homework to make its leaders speak responsibly in the House. #FMToNews18 | I want to take Rahul Gandhi seriously but most often he shoots from his hip. He doesn’t keep good foundational data. India deserves a better Opposition party: FM @nsitharaman to @18RahulJoshi#Budget2026 #BudgetWithNews18LIVE: https://t.co/Z5J3NSMECC pic.twitter.com/GFt6QlOO5W Q: The one thing that you did this time which has become a subject of conversation — the markets also reacted — was increasing STT in the derivative segment. And I have heard the comments by your secretaries who say that it was to curb rampant speculation. Could it have been done differently, by managing margins or contract sizes? And was it a prudent thing to do at a time when the global sentiment is the way it is and the markets are also on a weak footing? How do you react to this? A: There are many observations that you are making on which opinions can differ. There are people who within India comment saying India’s markets are overpriced. I am not even getting into that debate. The Revenue Secretary made it absolutely clear — it is not for revenue considerations that we have done this. It is not on all STTs. We are only touching on futures and options. Cash is not even touched. So it is the speculative tendencies… and in fact, the Ministry of Finance has received several parents, elders who call us and say, “Are you going to sit and watch people lose money?\" And one of the studies showed that 90% of people who have gone into futures and options have lost money. Of course, the market regulator will also do his or her bit; the institution will do its bit. So we have only tried bringing in a deterrent where speculation is rife. We are not touching the market. Other STTs have not been touched. Q: Thank you for that clarification. Let me ask you a slightly directional question. Whether it is long-term capital gains or short-term capital gains, in the last few years, they have only inched up, when most of the other taxes have really gone down. So how do you — I am asking you from a broader perspective as the Finance Minister — how do you see this pan out over the years? A: I don’t agree with you when you say it’s “inched up\". Yes, it has gone up, or it is rationalised so that all asset classes can be treated equally. And that is the logic and reasoning behind that particular rate change. It wasn’t done with an intent of earning out of it. But the disparity and the differential couldn’t be sustained. So we had to rationalise it. And in fact, after that, we even gave that option to say, “You choose which one you want to have.\" I remember standing up during the government amendments time — the Finance Bill passing time — we brought in that flexibility to the people who felt that they were short-changed. So that was rationalisation; that wasn’t for kicking up the rates. A: The stable approach towards tax incidence, or keeping tax incidence stable, has always guided us. Q: The other overhang for the markets has been this… you know, US tariffs. Let me ask you a direct question. I feel that, you know, there is a sense of things thawing between the two countries. Are we close to a deal? Q: But you do think that… you think that things are improving from both the sides? Looking at… A: The FTAs are being signed…European Union, UK, Australia, New Zealand. So work is going on in getting FTAs done. Q: So, Donald Trump has said — I think yesterday or the day before — that India is ready to buy Venezuelan oil and not Iranian crude. He says that, you know, broadly there is an agreement on the concept of a deal. Would you confirm that? Q: Let me move to something else. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has reduced benchmark repo rates by about 125 basis points since 2025, but 10-year bond yields have increased, which means higher borrowing costs. How do we tackle this? How do we reduce the cost of borrowing? A: I think we are very conscious that yields are going up. Again, without shifting the blame or responsibility, it is dependent on many different factors. Yes, “crowding in\" is one of the things on which the market gets heated up, and yields can go up. But it is a fact that, given the levels of developmental activities that all of us want to ramp up — both the central government and state governments — going to the market is one way of raising your funds. But the yields going up also pushes back, and the people who want to look at better timing go back without raising the funds. So there is this concern, and that itself could be a deterrent for many states because they cannot afford it. It is a very evolving situation, and we will have to see how it goes. Q: Finance Minister, your party has always stood for a strong rupee. But if you look at the Indian rupee in the last year, it has been on a losing streak. It has almost lost 10 per cent against the dollar and around 16 per cent against the euro. Are you comfortable with this level of the rupee, and are you happy with the steps that the RBI is taking to maintain it? A: Let us understand one thing. Our party, yes, was in favour of — and is in favour of — a strong rupee, no doubt. But it also has to be predicated in the context of how the economy is. An economy suffering from high inflation, an economy being fragile, and your rupee value also not in a good position, makes it really hard and difficult for everybody. But one thing I can clearly say is that the economy is fine and fit. The macroeconomic fundamentals are strong. That is not to say, therefore, that I am indifferent to the rupee-dollar exchange rate. I am not indifferent. But I will also look at it from the realistic challenges that we have to understand where the rupee finds itself now. The Reserve Bank is closely monitoring the situation. Q: So you are saying that you are comfortable with this situation at the moment, given the circumstances? A: I will leave it there. I do not think I will say I am comfortable or not comfortable. I will leave it there. Q: India’s holdings of US Treasury bonds have declined about 25 per cent compared to the peak of 2023. At the same time, the Reserve Bank of India has increased its holdings on gold. Do you see this trend continuing? A: I think many central banks, not just the Reserve Bank of India, are pitching to buy more gold. And India seems to be following the trend. Q: Gold is up by about 80%, silver by 250%. How do you see this in the last one year — this phenomenon? A: The uncertainties in the world are making people fall back on, let’s say, a time-proven asset, which is gold. And that’s bound to be, because it is beyond anyone’s fair assessment to see where things will move. And therefore, the demand for gold. Q: That brings me to the next point, which was also discussed a lot in this budget: capital gains on sovereign gold bonds purchased in the secondary market. Market participants feel this is some kind of a retrospective tax. Do you agree with that? What was the logic behind this? A: No. The intent of that sovereign gold bond was at the time of the issuance and also making sure that you hold it the full term. So those are the two boxes to be checked. If you are doing one and not the other – you picked it up not at the time of issuance but from the secondary markets – one of the boxes is not getting ticked. And, therefore, you’re taxed. You bought it during issuance, but you are not holding it full term – one box is not checked. So, you’re being taxed. It’s only when you have taken it at issuance and you are holding it full term, you get that concession. So every other – for which there are only four situations, right – the other three situations, where both the boxes are not getting checked… Q: Is where you are…You’ve set up a committee to review the banking sector. What will be the remit of this committee? What are the timelines that you are looking at? Could you give us some details? A: I have not worked on the TOR [Terms of Reference] yet. But the broad intent was that towards ‘Viksit Bharat’, there couldn’t be a better time for us, especially now when the banks’ health is very good. We would want, from that strength, to understand where we can go. And how do we go. Which is the path that we take to go there. So that is where we want that committee to work. Q: You know, in the past you have been disappointed about private sector capex not picking up. You have said it in a couple of meetings; you have said it in our interviews as well. Do you see an uptick now because of certain reforms that you have introduced? A: I see some green shoots. I think the situation is improving, and I have reasons to believe that private sector investments will only grow. Q: When I was asking you about this bank committee, there are two questions that I have related to that. One is, are you looking at the consolidation of PSU banks — you know, some mega banks as opposed to a whole lot of PSU banks today? And the second, would you allow conglomerates, Indian private conglomerates, to get into banking? A: That’s for the committee to tell me. Of course, I have told you that the Terms of Reference are not made yet. But obviously, when you are looking at banking for ‘Viksit Bharat’ — banking sector for a ‘Viksit Bharat’ — there are many core such issues which the committee will have to look into. We’ll wait and see what they have to say. It may not be right for me to give my view and, you know, pre-empt what they are going to say. Q: But about the PSU banks, directionally, are we in that direction? I mean, you know, there are far too many of them, and a consolidation of some kind might lead to bigger entities which may be more viable. A: Let’s wait for the committee to say. There is a need for India to have more banks, better banks, bigger banks, whatever. The committee will have to have its mind, that’s it. Q: One more interesting question I have that you announced seven new high-speed rail corridors in your Budget. Again, a little more details: what is the timeframe that you are looking at? How will you go about it? A: It is so much left to the Rail Ministry. But the fact that they have done the necessary ground study and the route plan and everything else… and they were absolutely clear that the budgetary announcement will make them sit up and deliberate. They are definitely going to be delivered at the earliest because these are dependent on India’s technologies, Indian coaches and so on. So the Rail Ministry will get into the details of it. Q: I have asked you this question before, but India’s trade deficit with China is greater than $116 billion in 2025. Even though the exports have also gone up, how do you tackle this issue? A: That is where I think we are very clear in ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’. We need to have capacities built in India for those essential goods that we import and make sure that we are able to make them in India for the Indian market. Even as I say this, we have not restricted the imports of some of the critical machines or equipment or some raw materials, which are so important for our industries. So capacities will have to grow but, in the meanwhile, you still need – for those very same capacities – imported equipment. So, we are doing a fine balancing act in not denying the raw material or the equipment coming because there are some precision tools, which you so need when you are going to set up a particular type of factory. We need those to come in here. But, at the same time, capacities in India will have to be expanded, ramped up sooner so that our dependencies can come down. But this story is one side of the coin. The other side of the coin is market access in China. I was the Commerce Minister, and I know in my time also, we’ve been asking for greater market access for Indian goods. That is moving very slowly. Q: Now that the relationship with China is improving, would you consider relaxing restrictions on investments by China through Press Note 3? That would really take the relationship to the next level. A: Well, some discussions were happening. I am not sure where it has reached as yet. Once we arrive at something, I will be able to expand on it. Q: Nirmala ji, there are many tax litigations going on in the country. You have done a lot for ease of doing business, tax uncertainties are there. In IT alone, disputed amounts worth about Rs 25 lakh crore are pending. You had come out with Vivad Se Vishwas — I don’t know how successful that was. How do we solve this problem as well? A: I think even in this Budget I have given — both for direct and indirect taxes — ways in which we can settle such disputes. Even in the last Budget, we had made it very clear that in some cases where the department or the board does not have to appeal against a verdict, we should sit back and say, “No, we are not appealing. One level of the court has decided, and we go in favour of the assessee.\" So the approach has to be more to settle and not pursue matters further. That is today’s understanding in both the boards. And I am very happy about it because now most of our measures are on that route — that we do not go appealing just because we want to earn a few hundred more rupees. Q: Nirmala ji, the disinvestment target is something that is missed almost every year in the last few years. This year also, you have taken an ambitious target of Rs 80,000 crore for the coming year. How is it going to be achieved? I have heard, you know, your press conference where it was discussed about IDBI. But what about Shipping Corporation, BPCL, BEML, Container Corporation, and so on? Can you give us some broad roadmap on the road forward? A: See, I am not repeating my answers, but I also want to underline the fact that when the government has decided in the cabinet that a certain number of disinvestments will have to happen, it is our duty to honour it. We will never be able to bypass it and say “no\", unless the decision itself is changed by the cabinet. And no decision has changed till now. Earlier — at least a few years ago — it was a Covid-affected market, an economy reviving market. So we had to be cautious about going to the market when it is not so suitable and so on. But I am very clear that I will be focusing also now on disinvestment. Having given quite a few concessions in direct taxation, having been given in GST indirect taxation, my revenue also will have to be looked at from the point of view of what am I going to get out of disinvestment. So it’s not to say that I didn’t give the attention earlier, but the earlier attention was circumscribed by the fact that we were facing Covid or we just came out of it, or the situation in the market is not… And some sectors do well and therefore you can take them forward faster; some others take their own time. But we will be going ahead with it. Q: This time it’s a very decisive mandate to go for, and you’re very confident of achieving the number as well? Q: Okay, that’s good to hear. Nirmala ji, you know, this budget has also given a big fillip to Artificial Intelligence (AI). And I would like you to spend a little time trying to help our viewers understand the rationale behind it. The Economic Survey does point out to an AI bubble building up in valuations. So in that backdrop, what are we planning to do? How do we take this forward? A: See, the government’s interest in bringing AI is to improve productivity. Large-scale production benefits when you have AI influencing it. Small-scale companies, MSMEs, in some sectors, will benefit with AI. AI is also now so much sought after from the point of view of the “orange economy\". AI has now become part of every office. I’ve said this before that in income tax and in GST, using artificial intelligence and deep tech, we are able to detect and see the money trail where we need to chase. Physically, manually, without technology, it would have taken years for us to find the money trail. Whereas now, you go on AI, you are able to get the entire web before you of who’s going where, from where to where money is being sent, and so on. So if that is the case with income tax, that’s the case also with rural technologies, with agriculture, with — surprisingly — even animal husbandry. Crop intensity, and then being able to predict what the crop outcome will be, and so on. So every department is today moving to use AI. Now, that’s not displacing labour; it’s creating more job opportunities. But job opportunities for those who are trained and skilled in AI. And that is why in this Budget you see that we are listing out ways in which we are going to bring technology into schools and colleges so that they will be able to come out and be an entrepreneur or set up a business to say, “You want some AI solutions? I can give you.\" We are doing that as a pilot now in three states at the ITI district level. In the age-old it is, where students went and learned some technology, they don’t become engineers, but get a diploma. That used to be the world earlier. Now we are upgrading all these district-level ITIs with the central government’s money and making sure that master trainers are sent to all the districts. Students are brought in; they can have the AI training and therefore be ready for the market. Just as in the last Budget and the Budget before, we had set up institutions of excellence for AI in agriculture, AI in health, AI in cities building. Q: Let me move to some political questions. And before anything else, this time people said there was not much mention of poll-bound states in your Budget. In fact, the governments in Kerala and Tamil Nadu have reacted and said that there is nothing in it for us. Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin has said that, you know, Tamil Nadu has been snubbed by you. How do you react to this? Super-fast trains — or the trains that we have announced, not bullet, but the high-speed trains — are going to Chennai. They are getting connected to Hyderabad; they are getting connected to Bengaluru. In fact, I was reading somewhere that once this comes in, the travel time between Chennai to Bengaluru will be one hour and 30 minutes or something like that. Is that not happening for Tamil Nadu? I had gone a couple of years ago, when Cyclone Ockhi happened to Tamil Nadu, particularly to the districts which are adjacent to the coast. Every coconut tree had fallen flat. We couldn’t even get enough saplings for those farmers that time, because everywhere they were looking at saplings from Karnataka and so on. Now, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, both of them are election-bound states. Coconut trees there…every farmer is going to get benefited because they can replace old trees which are not giving yield with fresh saplings. Coconut promotion — doesn’t it benefit poll-bound Tamil Nadu? Doesn’t it benefit poll-bound Kerala? The rare earth corridors. Both Kerala and Tamil Nadu get it. Poll-bound states? In fact, if I can say, the defence corridor is in Tamil Nadu. Now they get the second corridor, which is the rare earth corridor. Are they suggesting that these are not activities which are going to benefit Tamil Nadu? I have taken the name and said it. Snubbing Tamil Nadu? I can’t believe this. Look at the allocation for Viksit Bharat G-RAM-G Act…Rs 95,000 crore is being given for it — the replacement for the MGNREGA. But equally, I am not denying all the dues which are in the old scheme, the overhangs. Rs 30,000 crore for that. Put together, it’s Rs 1,20,000 crore. Is that against Tamil Nadu? Third question. Fourth. Look at the way in which… not just coconut… we are looking at sandalwood. The moment… there was a time in Tamil Nadu, schoolchildren would immediately recall the name of Veerappan —the sandalwood smuggler. Today, the government is not talking about lawlessness or anything; it is saying I want to promote sandalwood growing. Farmers who are cultivating sandalwood — I know of some farmers in Andhra Pradesh, South Andhra Pradesh, who are growing sandalwood — but because it is not given permission, the farmer is not given the permission to cut and sell it, he is encumbered with it. Won’t it benefit the farmers there? So there are ever so many… and semiconductor! Electronics 2.0: Rs 40,000 crore. Where are these industries? They are not in Tamil Nadu? Semiconductor industry, when you stand next to the company and take a photo saying, “Oh, Tamil Nadu received this investment\" — isn’t the policy of the Government of India helping you to get it? Why mislead people? Be proud that you are getting it. Q: MK Stalin has definitely touched a raw nerve here. But the second question is MK Stalin is framing this entire battle in Tamil Nadu as an “Aryan-Dravidian\" battle. How do you see this? Q: How do you see this and what do you think are the narratives that are being set for this election? A: It is a completely separatist mindset that rules the ruling party of Tamil Nadu. They have lived with it, and they continue doing it. It is a tendency to make Tamil Nadu appear very different from the rest of India and to give a picture of “we don’t care what you do; we are a separate state\". That mindset is what they want to feed continuously, which worries me. The people of Tamil Nadu are not like that. The current leadership of Tamil Nadu wants to play on this wedge-driving. That is why, for every such comment that they get, there are people who respond, and these people build on it. It is a sad state. I am not sure I want to credit anybody, but Tamil Nadu has not seen it this bad as it is seeing it under the current dispensation. Q: But why has the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) not really done well in Tamil Nadu? A: A national party like Congress, which lost power 60 years ago in Tamil Nadu, is playing fiddle to the current government. And it is always standing up only with the crutches of a party with whose alliance they try to win some MLAs and a few MPs. They are not able to come back to power. Whereas Tamil Nadu was never under the BJP; we are now trying to serve the people and enter to win some seats. And we hope that the alliance will be able to form a government there. Q: How big is the Vijay-TVK factor in Tamil Nadu? The DMK is saying the Bharatiya Janata Party, the government is coercing and harassing Vijay to join the NDA…. Q: Stalin and the DMK are saying that they are trying to do CBI raids on him, his film’s not being released. How do you see this? Is he that big a factor in this election? A: If anybody, who has got to be afraid of a factor that is big and worrying, is the party which is ruling. So why should we be upset about it? If he is a threat to the ruling DMK, I don’t need to be worried about it. Good enough. #FMToNews18 | We have to work hard to aspire to bridge gap between India and China. Global companies setting up businesses in India will get tax holidays benefit: Finance Minister @nsitharaman to @18RahulJoshi #Budget2026 #BudgetWithNews18LIVE: https://t.co/Z5J3NSMECC pic.twitter.com/PbmcXLFBHE A: That’s a different story. So, the DMK being worried about Vijay, I can understand it. Because Vijay on the one side – either with or without us – the AIADMK alliance, the NDA now very strong, also coming up, are all making the DMK, although they are in power, completely insecure. That is why you find all kinds of freebies being announced even now. If you have been in power for five years and you have governed well – whereas I would allege that they didn’t govern well because of lawlessness and drugs, like never before in Tamil Nadu – but if you’d governed well and, if that’s what you claim, why would you want to throw all these freebies now? Q: But, is the BJP worried that Vijay could come together with the Congress? They are both making overtures at each other. So is that a worry – that that could be a formidable combination in Tamil Nadu? A: Where is the Congress in Tamil Nadu? Despite the crutches that they are holding onto – the DMK crutches – where is the Congress? And today it is a divided house. The Congress in Tamil Nadu is a divided house. Let them make up their mind where they want to be. One group wants to go with the TVK, the other group wants to remain with the DMK. They have embarrassed themselves by wanting to be there, reap benefits there, but yet wanting to go to a new alliance. Haven’t they messed themselves up? Q: But do you think Vijay is the X-Factor this election and is he consequential this time? RJ: Thank you so much for taking so much time and answering all our questions. It was indeed a pleasure talking to you. Thank you and look forward to the next interaction.",

        "title": "Delhi’s Bijwasan Mega Railway Terminal To Be Operational By June, Aiming To Ease Congestion",
        "content": "Delhi is slated to get a new mega railway terminal at Bijwasan by June this year. The facility is expected to ease congestion at New Delhi and Old Delhi stations and streamline train operations across the capital. The station’s redevelopment is part of a long-planned mega project that had been on hold until now The Bijwasan terminal is part of a long-pending plan first announced in 2008 to decongest Delhi’s core railway stations by developing large terminals on the city’s outer edges. The plan aims to route trains according to their direction, enabling smoother operations, improved punctuality, and the possibility of introducing more services. Anand Vihar, Bijwasan, Holambi Kalan, and Shakurbasti were identified as key locations for this purpose. “Bijwasan is almost in the final stage, it should be operational by June or July this year,\" Northern Railway General Manager Ashok Kumar Verma told News18. The terminal is designed to handle a large share of trains heading towards Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra. Currently, Bijwasan has just two platforms, but the upgraded station will have eight platforms. Over 80 percent of the construction work has already been completed. One of the biggest hurdles was the lack of connectivity to the station and tracks due to pending tree-cutting permissions. “Earlier, the station work got stuck because of connectivity issues. There were problems related to access and clearances, including tree-related issues. Now the work is going on in full swing,\" Verma said. The importance of Bijwasan lies in its location. It sits close to IGI Airport Terminal-3, Urban Extension Road-2 and the Dwarka Sector-21 Metro station, making it easily accessible for passengers. A bus terminal is also proposed nearby, which could turn the area into a major multi-modal transport hub. Railways officials believe the terminal will play a key role in easing pressure on New Delhi, Old Delhi and Sarai Rohilla stations by shifting select trains to Bijwasan. This redistribution is expected to improve passenger comfort and help trains run more on time. Speaking about other terminals planned under the same decongestion strategy, Verma said work is progressing at multiple locations. “At Shakur Basti, there are multiple components involved. One is that we are creating a new station. Earlier, the station work was started and it got stuck because of some connectivity issues. Now the work is going on in full swing,\" he said, adding that the new three-platform station there could be operational around August. He also pointed to challenges in turning some locations into full-fledged terminals. “Then the issue of getting connected from the Delhi side to that area and making a major terminal there… there are issues of encroachment and slum areas. We are working on that and we hope to get that also sorted out,\" Verma said. Apart from Bijwasan and Shakur Basti, work on the Holambi Kalan terminal is also underway. “Holambi Kalan DPR work is going on. We finalised the DPR,\" the GM said. Once these projects are completed, the Railways expects a improvement in passenger experience in Delhi, with reduced crowding at central stations, better train regulation and the ability to introduce additional services on busy routes.",

        "title": "Can MPs Quote Books In Parliament? Rule 349 Explained Amid Rahul Gandhi-Centre Clash",
        "content": "A massive uproar in Lok Sabha on Monday over Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi’s reference to the unpublished memoir of former Army Chief General MM Naravane brought attention to a parliamentary provision, Rule 349 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Lok Sabha. Amid the political clashes, the controversy centred on whether Gandhi was permitted to cite material drawn from an unpublished memoir on India-China border clashes. The issue arose during the debate on the President’s Address, when Gandhi began his speech by quoting from a magazine article that referred to passages from Four Stars of Destiny, an unpublished memoir attributed to General Naravane. Treasury bench members objected, arguing that citing an unpublished book violated parliamentary rules. Speaker Om Birla intervened, invoking Rule 349 and directing Gandhi not to read from such material unless it was authenticated or formally placed before the House. Rule 349 lays down standards of conduct and procedure that Members of Parliament are expected to follow during debates. Clause (i) of the rule states that “a member shall not read any book, newspaper or letter except in connection with the business of the House.\" In effect, the rule restricts MPs from freely quoting external material unless it is directly relevant to the subject under discussion and conforms to parliamentary conventions. The intent is to prevent the House from becoming a forum for unverified claims, private publications or sensitive content that has not been officially tabled. Former Lok Sabha Secretary General PDT Achary explained that Rule 349 is the key provision governing the quoting of external material. According to him, MPs are generally allowed to cite newspaper or magazine reports provided they can stand by the authenticity of the information. No prior notice is required, he noted, adding that debates on the President’s Address are broad in nature and allow members to raise a wide range of issues. The objection from the treasury benches stemmed from the fact that Gandhi referred not only to a magazine article but also to an unpublished memoir of a former Army Chief, a matter they argued could have implications for national security and parliamentary propriety. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Home Minister Amit Shah maintained that unpublished material could not be cited in the House. Speaker Om Birla ruled that magazine or newspaper articles unrelated to the immediate business of the House could not be quoted, reiterating that debates must be conducted strictly in accordance with established rules. Gandhi, however, defended his reference, insisting that his sources were authentic. Questioning the objections, he asked what in the material was causing such concern and argued that if there was nothing to hide, he should be allowed to continue. When stopped from directly quoting the article or the memoir, he sought permission to describe its contents without attribution, but this too was disallowed. Parliamentary experts say Rule 349 does not amount to an absolute prohibition on referring to books, newspapers or reports. Members may cite such material if it is relevant to the discussion, does not breach privilege or national security concerns, and adheres to convention. Ultimately, the Speaker has the final authority to decide whether a particular reference is admissible. In today’s proceedings, the Chair’s ruling, and the disagreement over its interpretation, turned Rule 349 into the focal point of a wider political confrontation.",

        "title": "BJP Set To Form Govt In Manipur, Names Tarun Chugh Central Observer For Key Meet",
        "content": "The BJP took a decisive step towards government formation in Manipur by appointing its National General Secretary Tarun Chugh as the Central Observer for the election of the Legislative Party Leader in the state. The move signals that the party is preparing to restore an elected government ahead of the expiry of President’s Rule. Senior leaders and legislators from the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), along with BJP’s Manipur unit chief, arrived in New Delhi on Sunday to attend a high-level meeting scheduled today. The meeting comes just days before the six-month extension of President’s Rule in Manipur ends on February 12, intensifying political activity around the formation of a new government. Manipur has been under President’s Rule since February 13 last year, following the resignation of former Chief Minister N Biren Singh on February 9 amid threats of a no-confidence motion by legislators. The state has been grappling with prolonged unrest since ethnic violence broke out on May 3, 2023, which has claimed over 260 lives and displaced more than 60,000 people. Speculation about the return of a popular government has grown as the deadline for President’s Rule approaches. Speaking to reporters at Imphal International Airport before leaving for Delhi, BJP MLA N Biren Singh said all NDA legislators had been called for the meeting. “There have been important developments after our recent meeting of BJP legislators. Since all NDA partners have now been summoned, there is a strong possibility of government formation,\" he said. National People’s Party (NPP) legislator Janghemlung Panmei struck a cautious note, saying the alliance would work towards restoring stability in the state. “We want good things to happen for Manipur again. The direction ahead will become clear after the meeting,\" he said. BJP state president A Sharda Devi also expressed optimism, stating that the meeting could pave the way for the formation of a new elected government. A person familiar with the discussions said the meeting would focus on building consensus among NDA legislators and that representatives from the Kuki-Zo community may also attend. In the 60-member Manipur Legislative Assembly, the BJP currently holds 32 seats. Its NDA allies include the NPP with seven MLAs, JD(U) with six, NPF with five, and Kuki People’s Alliance (KPA) with two members. The Congress has five legislators, while three MLAs are Independents.",

        "content": "In a big relief to Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu, the Enforcement Directorate cleared his name in alleged laundering of proceeds of crime linked to Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development Corporation (APSSDC) Siemens project case. In its fresh chargesheet, ED stated that government’s funds were “diverted\" by certain accused. The Skill Development Project was a public-private partnership that aimed at settin up 40 skill development centers across the state. However, the project was marred by the financial irregularities. Notably, Naidu was arrested in this case in 2023 during the previous YSRCP-led Andhra Pradesh government of Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy. Naidu had spent more than 50 days in the Rajamahendravaram Central Prison before the Andhra High Court granted him bail on October 31, 2023. Reddy’s government alleged that irregularities in the scheme caused a loss of Rs 300 crore to the state exchequer. As per a report by PTI, ED stated in its supplementary chargesheet that it did not find any role of Naidu in the “laundering\" of the proceeds of crime. The skill development project pertained to setting up clusters of Centres of Excellence (CoEs), with the total project cost estimated at Rs 3,300 crore. A new chargesheet has been submitted against Designtech Systems Pvt. Ltd. (DTSPL), its Managing Director Vikas Khanvelkar, former Managing Director of Siemens Industry Software India Pvt. Ltd. Soumyadri Sekhar Bose, also known as Suman Bose, and their close associates Mukul Chandra Agarwal, Suresh Goyal, along with others. According to the Enforcement Directorate, Khanvelkar, Bose, Agarwal, and Goyal misappropriated government funds by using shell and inactive entities through complex transactions. They allegedly siphoned off the funds using fake invoices under the guise of supplying materials and services.",

Speaking to ANI, he explained that while the engine has performed well, delivering a maximum thrust of 72 kilonewton (kN), the LCA requires 83–85 kN to operate optimally. “Kaveri engine, in its original form, has not delivered the thrust that is required for the LCA,\" Kamat said. “The engine is working very well, it has given us a thrust of 72 kilonewton. But the LCA needs a thrust of 83-85 kilonewton.\" #WATCH | Delhi: On Kaveri engine development, DRDO Chairman Samir V Kamat says, “Kaveri engine, in its original form, has not delivered the thrust that is required for the LCA. The engine is working very well, it has given us a thrust of 72 kilonewton. But the LCA needs a thrust… pic.twitter.com/VxpPEry843— ANI (@ANI) February 2, 2026 However, he added that a derivative of the engine is being adapted for India’s unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs). “Without the after burner, the Kaveri engine will be used in our unmanned combat aircraft,\" he said. Kamat also highlighted the long timeline of aero-engine development. “If you look at globally also, any engine development program takes between 10-13 years to reach maturity before it can be integrated with the platform. So, if the CCS gives a sanction this year, I would assume that by 2035-2036,\" he said. He added that the first two squadrons of the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) will initially use the GE F414 engine, with the indigenous engine to follow later. The DRDO chief further outlined the organisation’s focus on future technologies. “Our focus is going to be on unmanned combat aerial vehicle… We are looking at quantum techonologies, at AIML (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) technologies, advanced materials and these technologies will go into any system that we develop,\" Kamat said. The Kaveri engine is a low-bypass, twin-spool turbofan designed by India’s Gas Turbine Research Establishment (GTRE) under DRDO. First conceived in the 1980s, it was intended to reduce India’s dependence on foreign engines for the Tejas fighter. The engine features a flat-rated design to minimise thrust loss at high speeds and temperatures, and includes a twin-lane Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system with manual override for reliability.",

        "content": "A disturbing incident of animal cruelty has come to light from Telangana’s Jagtial district, where dozens of stray dogs were allegedly poisoned to death in a village, triggering outrage among residents and animal welfare groups. The episode has once again brought into focus the growing tension between public safety concerns and humane animal control measures. The incident took place in Abboor village of Gollapalli mandal in Jagtial district. According to locals, several unidentified individuals allegedly mixed poison into food and left it at multiple locations across the village late on Sunday night. On Monday morning, villagers woke up to a shocking sight of the bodies of stray dogs lying along roads and street corners. Residents said the number of stray dogs in the area had increased in recent months, and some people had been discussing the issue informally. However, instead of approaching local authorities or municipal bodies for a lawful solution, a few individuals appear to have taken matters into their own hands, choosing a brutal and illegal route. Within hours of consuming the poisoned food, the dogs reportedly began collapsing in public spaces, many of them dying in visible distress. The scale of the deaths sent shockwaves through the small village, with images of the carcasses quickly spreading on social media and drawing statewide attention. The incident prompted immediate backlash from local youth and animal lovers. A formal complaint was lodged at the Gollapalli police station, following which Sub-Inspector Krishnasagar Reddy visited the village to assess the situation. Preliminary findings suggest that the poisoning was intentional. Police have registered a case and begun examining CCTV footage from nearby areas to identify those responsible. Officials said further details would be revealed once the investigation progresses. The investigating officer reportedly made it clear that killing animals due to nuisance or inconvenience is a punishable offence. Authorities have stressed that such actions cannot be justified under any circumstances and that those involved will face legal consequences if found guilty. The law provides explicit protection for animals, including stray dogs. Under Sections 428 and 429 of the Indian Penal Code, maiming or killing animals is a criminal offence that can attract fines and imprisonment. Additionally, the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, prohibits acts that cause unnecessary pain or suffering to animals. Supreme Court rulings over the years have reinforced that stray dogs cannot be killed as a method of population control. Instead, the legally recognised approach is the Animal Birth Control (ABC) programme, which focuses on sterilisation and vaccination to manage stray populations humanely. Municipal bodies are responsible for implementing these measures, not private citizens. Animal rights organisations across Telangana have condemned the incident, calling it both inhumane and unlawful. Welfare activists argue that poisoning animals reflects rising intolerance and a lack of awareness about lawful solutions. Many stress that concerns about stray dog populations should be addressed through civic channels such as municipal corporations or panchayat offices, which can coordinate sterilisation drives and vaccinations. Resorting to violence, they say, only worsens the problem while exposing communities to legal risks. In Abboor village, a few dogs that reportedly consumed the poisoned food but survived are now receiving treatment from veterinary doctors. Local volunteers and youth groups have stepped in to assist with rescue efforts and are demanding strict punishment for those responsible. Incidents involving stray dogs often trigger emotional and polarising debates in India. While some residents raise safety concerns, particularly involving children and the elderly, animal welfare advocates insist that cruelty cannot be the answer. Experts note that unregulated killings neither solve the root issue nor prevent future population growth. Instead, they advocate sustained sterilisation programmes, waste management improvements, and community awareness as long-term solutions. The Abboor episode serves as a grim reminder of the fragile balance between human convenience and compassion toward animals. As investigations continue, the focus now shifts to accountability, and to whether this tragedy will prompt stronger enforcement of animal protection laws and better civic responses to stray animal management. The incident took place in Abboor village of Gollapalli mandal in Jagtial district. According to locals, several unidentified individuals allegedly mixed poison into food and left it at multiple locations across the village late on Sunday night. On Monday morning, villagers woke up to a shocking sight of the bodies of stray dogs lying along roads and street corners. Residents said the number of stray dogs in the area had increased in recent months, and some people had been discussing the issue informally. However, instead of approaching local authorities or municipal bodies for a lawful solution, a few individuals appear to have taken matters into their own hands, choosing a brutal and illegal route.

        "title": "Which Book Did Rahul Gandhi Quote In Lok Sabha And Why Did It Trigger A Ruckus?",
        "content": "Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s reference to an unpublished memoir of former Army chief General MM Naravane sparked an uproar in the Lok Sabha on Monday, as the Speaker repeatedly reminded members of rules that material not in the public domain cannot be quoted by members. Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi read out passages he said were taken from the unpublished memoir, ‘Four Stars of Destiny’, while speaking during the Motion of Thanks to the President’s address. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh immediately objected, telling the House that no one can quote from a book that has not even been published. The passages being cited in the House relate to memoir excerpts attributed to Naravane. The book has not yet been officially released and is under review by the Ministry of Defence. The Caravan magazine published excerpts from the as-yet-unpublished manuscript, which allegedly describe decision-making and exchanges over a border standoff with China. The report began with a purported incident in August 2020, and the X post shared by The Caravan too mentioned Galwan. Rahul Gandhi, however, mentioned Doklam during his speech. Doklam, at the tri-junction of India, China and Bhutan, was the site of an India–China standoff in 2017. In 2020, eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley witnessed a deadly clash between the two sides, with 20 Indian soldiers confirmed dead. Cover Story | Naravane presided over the June 2020 Galwan clash in which India lost 20 soldiers and control over significant territory.

These were the first military deaths in a clash on the India–China border in Ladakh since the 1962 war, triggering a public-relations crisis for the Modi government and casting a long shadow on bilateral relations,\" an X post by The Caraven said. It added that in the absence of any official confirmation, it is difficult to quantify the territorial gains made by China in eastern Ladakh since May 2020, but also quoted activist Sonam Wangchuk’s wife as saying that “China is not only occupying our land but also coming deeper inside Indian territory every year\". The Caravan’s reportage characterises the manuscript as an “as-yet-unpublished memoir\" titled ‘Four Stars of Destiny’ and quotes passages that portray tense interactions during the Ladakh crisis. Amid the controversy, Union minister Kiren Rijiju hit back and Rahul Gandhi, and said: “Aksai Chin, Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh…can the parts encroached under Congress rule be retrieved? Gandhi should first apologise for 1959 and 1962. He must apologise to the nation for the historical blunders of his party.\" Initially, the Parliament’s dispute on Monday centred not on the broader themes of the book but on whether unpublished material may be quoted in the House and whether the specific extracts cited are authentic. As the uproar continued, the Defence Minister and other Union Ministers in the House maintained that an unpublished book cannot be treated as an authenticated public source for parliamentary proceedings. The Chair intervened repeatedly, directing the LoP to authenticate the material and reminding members that parliamentary convention and rules do not allow quoting from unpublished books or paper clippings. Congress marshals, including KC Venugopal, backed the LoP’s claim of authenticity, while the Leader of Opposition maintained the material was “100 per cent authentic\" and said he was responding to allegations from the opposite benches. Rijiju said Gandhi “wasted 30 minutes\" to break a rule. “Gandhi did not authenticate the book he was quoting from. The Speaker gave a ruling under 349. Without authenticating, you can’t quote. Even then he repeated the mistake, wasting 30 minutes to break a rule,\" he said. The Speaker cited established practice, including parliamentary rules invoked during the exchanges, and warned that members must follow the Chair’s rulings. At one point, the Chair said it was not a new ruling but a convention Parliament follows. When the LoP persisted, the Chair warned it would call another member to speak. The Lok Sabha had met to take up the Motion of Thanks on President Droupadi Murmu’s address delivered on January 28, a standard opening item for the Budget Session. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to reply later in the week, and the Budget Session will run through multiple sittings over a 65-day period. Members used the allotted time to raise a range of issues, the quotation dispute emerged during the Leader of the Opposition’s remarks on matters relating to India’s relations with China and the Ladakh standoff, which the LoP claimed were relevant to the President’s address. Before Rahul Gandhi had begun speaking, BJP MP Tejasvi Surya used his allotted time to sharply criticise the Congress and the UPA years, calling them a “decade of lost opportunities\". His remarks provoked interruptions from the Opposition, and Home Minister Amit Shah intervened in that earlier exchange. The motion itself was moved by Union minister Sarbananda Sonowal and set the stage for the longer debate in which the quotation dispute later surfaced. On June 15, 2020, Indian and Chinese troops clashed in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh, triggering the deadliest confrontation between the two sides in more than four decades. By early June, India had objected to Chinese troops setting up temporary structures near Patrol Point 14 (PP14), an area both sides regularly patrol and use for face-to-face meetings. On June 6, local commanders from both sides agreed to disengage and pull back troops from the area. China dismantled one tent, and both sides agreed to withdraw around two kilometres. However, days later, Indian troops discovered that Chinese soldiers had returned and erected new tents, including one positioned on elevated ground overlooking the valley. On the evening of June 15, a team went to verify whether the disengagement had been completed. According to Indian accounts, when the Indian patrol attempted to remove the newly erected structure, a scuffle broke out between the two sides, quickly escalating into a brutal hand-to-hand fight using stones, rods and makeshift weapons wrapped with barbed wire.",

        "content": "The Uttar Pradesh government has moved decisively to enforce its zero-tolerance stance on corruption, withholding the January salary of 68,236 state employees who failed to disclose details of their movable and immovable assets on the Manav Sampada portal within the stipulated deadline. Officials said salaries will remain on hold until the concerned employees upload complete asset declarations online. Acting on the directions of Chief Secretary SP Goyal, all state government employees were mandated to submit details of assets acquired up to December 31, 2025, on the portal by January 31, 2026. Despite repeated reminders, a significant number failed to comply even after the deadline expired, prompting the government to take strict action. Out of a total workforce of 8,66,261 employees, the maximum non-compliance was reported among Group C staff, with 34,926 employees yet to submit their asset details. They are followed by 22,624 Group D employees, 7,204 Group B officers and 2,628 Group A officers. Officials clarified that none of these employees will receive their January salary in February unless the required information is uploaded. Senior officials described the move as a crucial step towards ensuring transparency and accountability in public service. Under the government employees’ conduct rules, annual disclosure of assets is mandatory, and failure to do so is treated as a serious violation. Authorities warned that continued non-compliance could invite departmental disciplinary action, including the withholding of promotions and other penalties. The Manav Sampada portal functions as the state’s integrated human resource management system, facilitating digital management of service records, salaries, asset declarations and other employee-related data. The current action forms part of the broader administrative reforms being pursued under the Yogi Adityanath-led government, aimed at curbing corruption and enforcing administrative discipline.",

        "title": "Budget 2026: Why India Allocated Zero Funds For Chabahar And What It Means For Its Iran Strategy",
        "content": "For the first time in nearly a decade, the Union Budget 2026–27 has earmarked no funds for India’s Chabahar port project in Iran. Over the years, the Centre consistently set aside Rs 100 crore annually for Chabahar; in 2025–26, revised estimates reached Rs 400 crore. But the new Budget shows zero allocation at a time when tensions between Washington and Tehran have surged, and uncertainty hangs over the fate of India’s sanctions waiver, valid only until 26 April 2026. The absence of funding comes just months after New Delhi reportedly completed its financial commitments by transferring around $120 million to Iran. Earlier this year, reports suggested that India had effectively exited its on-ground role after making these payments, which may also explain why a fresh allocation was not technically required. But the zero allocation is being read less as disengagement and more as a geopolitical pause driven by sanctions calculations. Geostrategist Brahma Chellaney said in a tweet, “Chabahar Port is India’s only viable route to Afghanistan and Central Asia that bypasses Pakistan. An Indian exit would almost certainly leave a vacuum for China to fill. The absence of funding for Chabahar in India’s 2026–27 Budget may therefore reflect a tactical freeze rather than a strategic retreat, given Washington’s April 26 deadline for India to wind down operations or face sanctions.\" He also noted that India is “exploring a middle path\" with Washington and described the US withdrawal of the earlier Chabahar exemption as “gratuitous\". Chabahar Port is India’s only viable route to Afghanistan and Central Asia that bypasses Pakistan. An Indian exit would almost certainly leave a vacuum for China to fill. The absence of funding for Chabahar in India’s 2026–27 Budget may therefore reflect a tactical freeze rather…— Dr. Brahma Chellaney (@Chellaney) February 1, 2026 Chabahar sits at the mouth of the Gulf of Oman in Iran’s Sistan–Balochistan province. It is Iran’s first deepwater port and lies just west of the Pakistan border, almost directly mirroring the position of Gwadar, developed by China under the Belt and Road Initiative. For Iran, the port has been projected as a means to mitigate the impact of Western sanctions by opening alternative trade routes. For India, it provides a vital route to Afghanistan and Central Asia that bypasses Pakistan, which has consistently denied overland access. India’s political engagement with Chabahar dates back more than two decades. Discussions began in 2002, when Hassan Rouhani, then Iran’s National Security Advisor, held talks with his Indian counterpart Brajesh Mishra. A year later, during President Mohammad Khatami’s 2003 visit to New Delhi, he and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee signed a cooperation roadmap that identified Chabahar as one of its key projects. The need for such a route has older roots. After Partition, India’s traditional land links with Iran and Central Asia were severed as Pakistan emerged as a hostile neighbour, though this had a limited impact for several decades because India’s economy remained largely closed. The regional situation changed significantly after the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in 1996. India and Iran, both opposed to the Pakistan-backed Sunni Islamist militia and aligned with the Northern Alliance led by Ahmed Shah Massoud, found their strategic interests converge. As Pakistan blocked India’s land access to Afghanistan, New Delhi’s search for alternative routes became increasingly urgent. Chabahar had also been seen as a potential route within the International North–South Transport Corridor (INSTC), the trade link connecting India with Russia and further into Europe through multi-modal transport. However, Iran’s own domestic legal requirements slowed progress, leading to repeated delays. Since 2015, India has invested about Rs 1,100 crore into the port’s development. In 2024, India signed a 10-year agreement to operate the Shahid Beheshti terminal, a long-sought milestone. In his tweet, Brahma Chellaney warned that an Indian withdrawal from Chabahar would “almost certainly leave a vacuum for China to fill.\" China is the only major power already positioned to move into Chabahar if India pauses its role. With its deep presence in Gwadar next door and a long-term strategic partnership with Iran, Beijing has both the capacity and the political space to step in quickly. Chabahar has long served as India’s counterweight to China’s footprint on the Arabian Sea; any Indian retreat would weaken that balance. Chabahar has been caught in the crossfire of shifting US policy on Iran. In 2018, Donald Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA) and restored full sanctions on Tehran. India received a Chabahar-specific exemption because the port was considered vital for Afghanistan’s stability. This waiver continued during Joe Biden’s presidency. Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in January: “As you are aware, on October 28, the US Department of Treasury had issued a letter outlining the guidance on the conditional sanctions waiver valid till April 26, 2026,\" Jaiswal said. “We remain engaged with the US side in working out this arrangement.\" The US has significantly expanded its military presence around Iran in recent weeks, with President Trump repeatedly threatening Tehran with military strikes if it refuses to return to the negotiating table over its nuclear programme. This comes on top of domestic unrest inside Iran and new European sanctions on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), further shrinking India’s diplomatic room for manoeuvre. Trump’s approach to Iran is one of several policies that have directly undermined India. These include the drastic 50 per cent tariff on Indian exports — the highest in the world — his positions on Kashmir, his stance during Operation Sindoor, and moves that have weakened India’s strategic leverage in the Indo-Pacific. Against this backdrop, Chabahar has shifted from being a connectivity project to a geopolitical pressure point caught between Washington and Tehran. Why The Zero Allocation Looks Like A Pause, Not A Policy Reversal The absence of a Budget allocation does not automatically mean India has stepped back from Chabahar. India has already completed its financial commitments for the Chabahar project. More than a year before the latest round of US sanctions was reimposed, New Delhi transferred $120 million to Tehran, the full amount it had pledged for the port’s development, according to an Economic Times report citing government sources. At the same time, India cannot risk violating US sanctions or triggering the 25 per cent tariff, especially with the waiver expiring in April. India remains in discussions with Washington to find a workable formula before the 26 April 2026 deadline. ORF senior fellow Sushant Sareen argued that critics needed to recognise the structural limits New Delhi faces. He stated: “India did this not out of choice but out of compulsion,\" challenging detractors by saying that if they believed there were alternatives, they should “openly defy US sanctions\" themselves. All those baiting GOI for exiting from Chabahar (India did this not out of choice but out of compulsion, which even though Iran doesn’t like, it should understand) are welcome to bust US sanctions on Iran and show solidarity with Iran by putting their money where their mouth is.…— sushant sareen (@sushantsareen) January 16, 2026 Taken together, the situation points to a period of deliberate waiting. Long before the Budget announcement, several strategic experts had weighed in on India’s position at Chabahar. Former foreign secretary Kanwal Sibal underlined that the stakes for India were far higher than for Iran. He wrote on X: “Chabahar is a connectivity project that gives India access to Afghanistan and Central Asia. Iran does not need Chabahar to have access to both.\" Warning of the strategic consequences of India being pushed out, he added: “Also, it opens the door to China to supplant India in the project,\" describing the sanctions pressure as “geopolitically senseless.\" Chabahar is a connectivity project that gives India access to Afghanistan and Central Asia.Iran does not need Chabahar to have access to both. So, sanctioning Chabahar delivers a blow to India’s strategic interests in the region which do not conflict with US interests. US-based scholar Christopher Clary commented on the changing nature of Washington’s approach, writing that earlier administrations were careful not to force India into hard choices. The current one, he said, “likes tugging on strings,\" pointing to a more coercive sanctions posture. Prior US govts did not want to force India to make a choice about Chabahar because we worried about the signals it would send. India would be confronted by the reality that any bilateral relationship comes with strings attached. This administration likes tugging on strings.— Christopher Clary (@clary_co) January 16, 2026 A different view came from Kabir Taneja, Executive Director at ORF’s Middle East programme, who noted that Chabahar has progressed at a “snail’s pace\" since 2003 but has always remained part of the India–Iran framework. “No reason for that to change,\" he said, suggesting continuity despite delays. There are also voices within government who acknowledged that if sanctions tightened further, India might be compelled to step back. A senior official told ET: “India has no choice but to exit the Chabahar port. Fortunately, we don’t have any assets there; we were only running the port with manpower from Iran,\" adding that there would be “no other option but to exit\" if the US did not ease sanctions.",

        "title": "Budget 2026 Announces Rare Earth Corridors: Mapping ‘The Vitamins Of Modern Industry’ In 4 States",
        "content": "Support for dedicated rare earth corridors in four states was among the key announcements made in Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Budget 2026 speech on Sunday. Which are the four states? Which rare earth minerals do they have? A scheme for Rare Earth Permanent Magnets was launched in November 2025. “We now propose to support the mineral-rich states of Odisha, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu to establish dedicated Rare Earth Corridors to promote mining, processing, research and manufacturing,\" said Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who presented her ninth consecutive Budget, said in her speech. Rare Earth Elements (REEs) are a group of 17 metallic elements comprising the 15 lanthanides on the periodic table, plus scandium and yttrium. Despite their name, they are relatively abundant in the Earth’s crust; for instance, cerium is as common as copper. They are considered “rare\" because they are seldom found in concentrated, economically mineable deposits and are difficult to chemically separate from one another. Rare earth elements are often called the ‘Vitamins of Modern Industry’ because even small amounts significantly enhance the performance of high-tech devices. Their importance stems from unique magnetic, luminescent, and electrochemical properties. Clean Energy & Green Tech: They are essential for the transition to a low-carbon economy. Neodymium and dysprosium are used to create powerful permanent magnets for electric vehicle (EV) motors and wind turbines. Consumer Electronics: REEs power the technology in your pocket. They are used in smartphone speakers, vibration units, and screens (yttrium and europium provide the red and blue colors). They are also critical for computer hard drives and LED lighting. National Defence: They are vital for advanced military hardware, including precision-guided missiles, radar systems, sonar, and jet engines. Medical Technology: REEs enable advanced imaging and treatment, such as MRI contrast agents, PET scanners, and medical lasers used in surgery and cancer treatment. Industrial Applications: They act as catalysts in petroleum refining and are used to create high-strength, corrosion-resistant metal alloys. Because there are currently no known equal substitutes for many of their applications, REEs are considered critical minerals. China currently dominates the global market, controlling approximately 70% of production and over 85% of refining capacity. This has led countries like the US, India, and the EU to invest heavily in diversifying supply chains to avoid geopolitical risks. Odisha, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu are the primary hubs for rare earth minerals in India, primarily due to their extensive coastal monazite deposits. Monazite is a mineral that contains several rare earth elements, notably the lanthanide group. Monazite is a reddish-brown phosphate mineral, typically found in igneous and metamorphic rocks or as heavy grains in placer deposits, serving as a primary ore for rare-earth elements (cerium, lanthanum, neodymium) and radioactive thorium. The distribution of monazite resources across these four states is as follows: Andhra Pradesh: Holds the largest share with 3.78 million tonnes of monazite across 24 deposits. Visakhapatnam is the most significant hub for rare earth magnets in India. The Rare Earth Permanent Magnet (REPM) Plant at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) campus in Visakhapatnam is the country’s first dedicated facility. It produces samarium-cobalt (SmCo) and neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets using indigenous technology and domestic raw materials. Andhra Pradesh is moving beyond mining into value-added downstream processing and magnet manufacturing. Odisha: Contains 3.16 million tonnes of monazite, located in 12 major deposits such as those in Gopalpur and Chhatrapur. Odisha is focused on developing new technologies for magnets used in defense, space, and EVs. Tamil Nadu: Has 2.47 million tonnes of monazite reserves spread across 50 deposits, including the Manavalakurichi beach sand and Sathankulam Teri sand deposits. Home to significant monazite resources, now being developed for an end-to-end magnet value chain. Kerala: Holds 1.84 million tonnes of monazite in 35 deposits, with significant concentration in areas like the Chavara barrier beach. The state is utilising its extensive beach sand mineral deposits to support refined rare earth extraction and magnet production. Midwest Advanced Materials (MAM) is establishing a Neodymium-Iron-Boron (NdFeB) magnet production plant in Hyderabad, supported by the Technology Development Board. Earlier in November 2025, the Union Cabinet had approved ‘Scheme to Promote Manufacturing of Sintered Rare Earth Permanent Magnets’ with a financial outlay of Rs 7,280 crore. This first-of-its-kind initiative is aimed to establish 6,000 Metric Tons per Annum (MTPA) of integrated Rare Earth Permanent Magnet (REPM) manufacturing in India, thereby enhancing self-reliance and positioning India as a key player in the global REPM market. REPMs are one of the strongest types of permanent magnets and are vital for electric vehicles, renewable energy, electronics, aerospace, and defence applications. Budget proposals on dedicated rare earth corridors in mineral-rich states like Odisha will spur the development of new technologies for manufacturing of rare earth magnets used in phones, defence, EVs and other modern equipment, industry players said on Sunday. “Today’s budget highlighted on creating Rare Earth Corridors in Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Kerala & Andhra Pradesh for mining, manufacturing, processing and refining of rare earth and critical minerals. This will lead to enhanced focus and development of new technologies for manufacturing of Rare Earth Magnets to be used in phones, defence & space equivalents, EVs and other modern equipment,\" Sanjiv Ganeriwala, Chairman of Mining Council Eastern India, Assocham, said. Also, beneficiation and refining of graphite will lead to large battery storage for solar energy and a lot of other industries. A lot of other rare and critical minerals beneficiation and refining will make India self-reliant and a leader in the world, he said. Grant Thornton Bharat Partner and Metals and Mining Industry Suvendu Bose said that the proposed dedicated rare earth corridors aim to integrate mining, processing, R&D, and manufacturing, addressing the weakest link in India’s energy transition: value-chain depth. Complemented by customs duty exemptions for capital goods in critical minerals processing, nuclear projects, lithium-ion cells and battery storage systems, and solar glass manufacturing, these measures advance India’s strategic self-reliance in minerals and chemicals crucial for EVs, renewables, nuclear power, defence, and advanced manufacturing, Bose said.",

        "title": "24 Passports Issued On Fake Address In UP’s Ghaziabad, Postman Among 26 Named In FIR",
        "content": "A serious fraud case has surfaced in the Bhojpur police station area of Ghaziabad, where 24 passports were issued using fake documents. All the applications used the same address and mobile number. Based on a letter from the Regional Passport Office, Delhi, an FIR numbered 0023/2026 was registered at Bhojpur police station. The case has been filed under Sections 61(2), 318(4), 338, 336(3), 340(2) of the Indian Penal Code 2023 and Section 66 of the IT Act. Police have started an investigation. Police found that 24 passport applicants, including Amanpreet Kaur, Jaspreet Kaur, Ritu Sharma and Meghna Rana, had shown addresses in Bhojpur, Tyodi, Saidpur Hussainpur and nearby villages. However, they were not residents of those villages. Village heads gave written statements confirming that the individuals did not live there. Police also found that the residence documents submitted with the applications were forged as part of a planned conspiracy. During the probe, Arun Kumar, a postman posted at Bhojpur Post Office, made a key revelation. He told police that around five months ago, two men named Vivek Gandhi and Prakash Subba asked him to hand over passports directly to them instead of delivering them to the addresses. He was offered Rs 2,000 for each passport and admitted that he accepted the money. According to police, passport verification is done through an online system and reports are submitted digitally. It is alleged that the accused, in collusion with the postman, applicants and others, manipulated the verification process. Using forged documents, they managed to secure positive verification reports, leading to the issuance of passports in at least 22 cases. A total of 26 named individuals, along with several unknown persons, have been accused. Police said they are investigating the entire network, including those who prepared the fake documents, intermediaries and those involved in the government process. Arrests and further legal action will follow after the investigation. Police sources said it cannot be ruled out that these passports could have been used for illegal or harmful activities. There is concern that such documents could be used for crime, illegal travel, identity theft or cybercrime. Officials said the case shows a serious lapse in the passport verification and postal delivery system and could have posed a major national security risk if not exposed in time.",

        "content": "Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju on Monday cited a post by Tesla CEO Elon Musk to push back against Lok Sabha Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi’s criticism of the Indian economy and Budget 2026, urging him not to “disparage India\" while attacking the government. The BJP leader was responding to a social media post by Musk, who reacted to a global statistics report projecting India as the second-largest contributor to global GDP growth in 2026. Musk had shared a post by @stats_feed stating that China and India together would account for “43.6% of global growth,\" adding, “The balance of power is changing.\" Hon’ble PM has given top priority to North-East and Eastern India. I’m happy that my colleague Union Minister and MP from Assam Shri @sarbanandsonwal Ji will move the motion of thanks to Hon’ble President for addressing joint session of Parliament & initiate discussion today. https://t.co/i6gqtvYSNN— Kiren Rijiju (@KirenRijiju) February 2, 2026 Rijiju said he was referring to Musk’s post not to elevate a foreign voice, but to underline India’s economic achievements amid domestic political debate. Also Read: ‘Balance Of Power Changing’: Elon Musk After IMF Data Shows India Above US In Global GDP Growth His remarks come amid sustained criticism by Gandhi of the BJP-led government’s economic management, including a reiteration of his “dead economy\" comment and fresh objections to provisions in the Union Budget 2026–27. A post shared by Elon Musk outlined the top 10 countries by their projected contribution to global GDP growth in 2026, citing data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The post also noted that the Asia-Pacific region is expected to account for nearly half of total global economic growth. According to the projections cited, India was ranked ahead of the United States, with a forecast contribution of 17% to global GDP growth. Other countries on the list included China at 26.6%, the US at 9.9%, Indonesia at 3.8% and Germany at 0.9%. Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday issued a sharp response to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s criticism of the Union Budget 2026–27, asserting that the fundamentals of the Indian economy remain robust and that the government is open to criticism grounded in facts. Also Read: ‘Ready To Debate With Facts’: FM Sitharaman Hits Back At Rahul Gandhi Over Budget Criticism Emphasising the government’s openness to debate, the finance minister added, “Political criticism is always welcome, but I want to know what you have to say based on facts.

        "title": "'They Don’t Ask Men': Sitharaman Flags Gender Bias Over Question On Budget Day Attire",
        "content": "Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday flagged what she described as persistent gender bias around Budget day, saying public attention often shifts from her work to her attire, a scrutiny she said male finance ministers do not face. “Every year, it becomes a strain on me because of questions about what I am going to wear on Budget day. I dare ask, would they have ever asked a male finance minister what he is wearing during the Budget? They don’t ask it of a man, but no, even this becomes a subject of the Budget,\" Sitharaman said during an interaction after the presentation of Union Budget 2026. Referring to public commentary, she said remarks such as “Arre saree kaun sa – what she is going to read what she going to tell us\" place undue importance on appearance rather than substance. “I don’t find this harmful, but it goes in a direction that is not necessary. This becomes a stress point for women. I am out of it now. I will wear what I want to,\" she said, adding that such discussions cross professional boundaries. Emphasising equality, Sitharaman said, “How you treat a man, you treat me also… that means that we draw equality in the true sense. You can’t demand privileges — Mahila hain ki? Nahi chalega, kaam main dikhao.\" Sitharaman, who on Sunday presented the Union Budget for a record ninth consecutive time, wore a handwoven Kancheevaram silk saree from Tamil Nadu. Her ninth straight Budget presentation was also highlighted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Cabinet meeting and during interactions at the start of the Budget session, with the Prime Minister calling it a significant achievement. A frequent target of misogynistic commentary, Sitharaman’s stature within and outside the government has grown over the years, particularly as she steered economic policy through crises such as the Covid-19 pandemic and global trade disruptions. Speaking to students after the Budget, including several young women, the finance minister said the repeated focus on her attire reflected a deeper issue that women in leadership continue to face. Against this backdrop, the Budget’s emphasis on women’s economic empowerment marked a broader extension of Sitharaman’s remarks. The government announced plans to set up a new retail and enterprise platform for women self-help groups (SHGs) and launch Self-Help Entrepreneur (SHE) Marts to strengthen market access for products made by rural women entrepreneurs. The initiative builds on the Centre’s Lakhpati Didi programme, aimed at enabling women to achieve financial independence. As the Prime Minister has said earlier, when women are empowered, the nation is strengthened — a theme that echoed through both Sitharaman’s Budget proposals and her remarks on the scrutiny she faces as a woman in public life.",
