Mahinsha\nWriting about the food habits of Malayalees in the 19th century in Pathonpathaam Noottandile Keralam (Kerala in the 19th Century) — a 1,300-page tome that sparkles with insight and scholarly wit — P. Bhaskaranunni observes that two meals a day were invariably the norm for the general populace. “Rice was very rare. What was available was of low quality. They somehow subsisted on gruel or mash made from chama (little millet), thina (foxtail millet), mula nellu (bamboo rice), koovaraku (finger millet), muthira (horse gram) and payar (beans).”\nElsewhere, he writes about the massive crop damage caused by the torrential rains in 1852 and again in 1853. “Even money could not buy a grain of rice. It was the year that Travancore imported rice for the first time. The imports were from Bengal.” These two images from the past illustrate how Kerala has changed, and yet not changed. To the Gen-Z of 21st-century Kerala, for whom Mexican tacos or Italian pizzas are only a few keypad taps away, the frugal food habits of their 19th-century ancestors would appear incomprehensible or utterly primitive. Yet one cannot discount the fact that 21st-century Kerala remains pitiably dependent on sister States for its staple diet — rice.  Domestic rice production continues to fall prey, year after year, to the whims of the monsoon rains.\nPresenting modern Kerala’s first budget in 1957, C. Achutha Menon, the Finance Minister in the first Communist government led by the inimitable E.M.S. Namboodiripad, observed that the greatest concern, both for the people and the government, was the “food problem.” But as he noted elsewhere in the same June 7, 1957 speech — and what now sounds eerily prophetic — it was not young Kerala’s only problem: “Density of population, scarcity of arable land and dearth of industries have contributed to unemployment, the most acute problem of Kerala.” It should be remembered that Achutha Menon — a gentle soul who would later become Chief Minister under a Communist Party of India (CPI)-Congress alliance and come to be regarded as the best Kerala has had — was speaking at a time when the population of the fledgling State was a mere 1.50 crore. What may seem astonishing is that if one were to transpose his words into the latest budget of Kerala — a Kerala of 3.4 crore people and a diaspora spread across the planet — they would not be out of place.\nThe problems he outlined persist, notwithstanding the firm belief held by K.N. Balagopal, Finance Minister in Kerala’s current Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led Left Democratic Front government, that the State’s budget size will soon touch ₹2 trillion. Since those distant points in time — the vicissitudes and romance of the 19th century and the politically turbulent years of the mid-20th century — Kerala’s economy and the living standards of its people have undeniably transformed beyond recognition. The State’s enviable literacy rate, low infant mortality, and high life expectancy, comparable to those of the developed West, gave rise to what has come to be hailed as the Kerala Model. This human-development paradigm evolved over decades, its contours shaped by Kerala’s distinctive political and socio-economic milieu, perceptive government policies such as land reforms and decentralised local governance, and constructive public action. Even so, despite strong social indicators in health, education, and social welfare, Kerala continues to grapple — albeit in broader and more complex dimensions — with many of the same problems that Achutha Menon identified in his first budget more than six decades ago. The review that follows examines the multiple pathways of Kerala’s economic evolution, its current status, the challenges it faces, and the recommendations of the 16th Finance Commission on the sharing of resources between the Centre and the States.\nIn the Economic Review 2024, the State Planning Board observed that Kerala ranks among the top 10 Indian States in terms of per capita income and Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP). According to the document, the Kerala economy recorded “robust” growth in 2023-24. The real GSDP stood at ₹6,35,13,653 lakh (Quick Estimates), registering a growth of 6.5%, compared to 4.2% in 2022-23. “The real Gross State Value Added (at 2011-12 prices) increased to 7.2% in 2023-24 from 5.3% in 2022-23. GSDP at current prices is ₹11,46,10,867 lakh in 2023-24, reflecting a growth of 11.9%, compared to 10.7% in 2022-23. The per capita GSDP of Kerala increased by 5.5% to ₹1,76,072 in 2023-24, against the national average of ₹1,24,600,” it noted, adding that the average income per person in Kerala is higher than the national average.\nKerala’s identity as a consumer State remains intact.

Mustafah\nGrowth in agriculture and production has remained sluggish at best, leaving Kerala with the now-familiar “consumer State” tag. A narrow geographical region squeezed between the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea, 21st-century Kerala faces stiff challenges arising from rapid urbanisation and its associated problems. In 1901, the combined population of Travancore, Cochin, and Malabar stood at 0.64 crore, of which 92.9% lived in rural areas. The 2011 Census showed that 47.7% of the people lived in urban areas — nearly half the total population. That said, Kerala’s journey to its present stage — shaped by global, national, and local dynamics — has been remarkable.\nIn the latter decades of the 20th century, Kerala’s extraordinary achievements in basic human development indicators despite its low per capita income drew social scientists and development economists to the small State. The legacies of successive Congress and Left-led governments, and the achievements in literacy, education, public health, and infant mortality, have been nothing short of impressive. It has been argued that the initial conditions were ideal for the evolution of what has since come to be hailed as the Kerala Model of Development. These conditions were shaped by Kerala’s unique history of social reform in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which placed great emphasis on universal education, women’s empowerment, and social action, the national fervour of the Freedom Struggle, and the subsequent emergence of a strong Left and a participatory people’s planning process.\nNoted development economist K.P. Kannan, in Kerala ‘Model’ of Development Revisited: A Sixty-Year Assessment of Successes and Failures, observed that during the first phase of this model — from 1960-61 to 1986-87 — growth was unimpressive not only in comparison to the national average, but also “bordered on stagnation” when viewed in per capita terms. “However, growth started picking up a few years after the acceleration in growth in the national economy. This was largely contributed by the increasing flow of remittances to the Kerala economy made possible by large-scale migration of its working-age population, mostly men, to work in countries in West Asia called the Gulf countries,” notes the paper published by the Centre for Development Studies (CDS), the institution established by the eminent economist K.N. Raj in 1971.\nForeign remittances have driven Kerala’s economic growth. The photo shows money exchange houses line the Changanassery-Alappuzha road at Perunna, home to a large expatriate population.\n| Photo Credit:\nK.K. Mustafah\nOne cannot overstate the role of foreign remittances in Kerala’s economic growth story. This phenomenon was driven by international demand for labour, especially in the oil-producing Gulf nations of West Asia. Estimates of average remittances indicate an increase from around ₹530 crore during the 1980-85 period to over ₹10,800 crore during 1995-2005. According to the Kerala Migration Survey 2023 (KMS 2023), remittance inflows rose from ₹85,092 crore in 2018 to ₹1,44,640 crore in 2021-2022 and ₹1,90,734 crore in 2022-2023. KMS 2023 pegged remittances in 2023 at ₹2,16,893 crore. The survey was conducted by the Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation (GIFT), with technical support from the International Institute of Migration and Development (IIMAD), at the behest of the Kerala government’s Department of Non-Resident Keralites Affairs (NORKA). “While the rise in remittance inflows in 2018-2019 could be attributed to the 2018 Kerala floods that led emigrants to send more money than usual to support relief and reconstruction, the spike in 2022-2023 could be attributed to post-pandemic recovery and a general rise in migration numbers,” the survey notes. The number of Keralites living abroad rose from 1.4 million in 1998 to 2.4 million in 2013, it adds.\nIn the 1980s, the State government’s Economics and Statistics Department conducted a survey on how Gulf remittances were utilised in Kerala. Submitted in 1988, the report observed a “considerable increase” in the assets of households receiving inward remittances from abroad, compared to other households under study. Yet even then, this slim document — prepared on the recommendation of a Subject Committee on Economic Affairs of the Kerala Legislative Assembly — had forewarned of a problem that Kerala grapples with today, in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and the global lockdown that spurred a “return migration”: “About 70% of the Gulf-returned persons are below the age of 40 and hence their rehabilitation would be a very important problem for Kerala,” the report warned.\nKerala faces high unemployment at 7.2%, especially among educated youth, more than double India’s 3.2% rate. The photo shows youth at a job fair organised by the Union Ministry of Labour and Employment, in Thiruvananthapuram.\n| Photo Credit:\nS. Mahinsha\nIt has often been stated that one of the major tasks confronting 21st-century Kerala will be finding suitable employment for its youth. The State has faced the issue of unemployment — especially that of the educated unemployed — for quite some time now. According to the Periodic Labour Force Survey (Annual Report 2023-24) published by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, Kerala has an unemployment rate of 7.2% for persons aged 15 years and above, compared to the all-India level of 3.2%. “In fact, high rates of unemployment, and unemployment among the educated, have been identified as the visible face of a mismatch between economic growth and human development in the State. With economic growth picking up in the nineties along with structural change, the problem of unemployment has acquired a new dimension of mismatch between demand and supply of skills, both in terms of quality and quantity,” the State Planning Board observed in a working-group paper on labour and labour welfare for the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2017–2022). Traditionally, Kerala’s strong trade-unionist legacy has been blamed for the perceived lack of industrial growth. The CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) government, which has been in power for two terms since 2016, has sought to change the deeply entrenched perception that Kerala is scarcely an ideal destination for industrial investment. Presenting the State Budget for 2025-26 in February 2025, Finance Minister K.N. Balagopal noted that Kerala topped the Ease of Doing Business index published by the Union government. “From the 15th position in 2021, we now stand first,” Balagopal said. In the 14th Five-Year Plan document, the State government, with its emphasis on building a knowledge economy, observed that Kerala has high rates of youth unemployment, and that the creation of “modern employment” for the youth will be a priority.\nGovernment data indicated robust growth across sectors in 2023-24. While the primary sector grew at 4.7%, secondary sector growth stood at 4.1%. The tertiary sector, meanwhile, posted “strong growth” of 8.9% in that fiscal year. Although tourism and Information Technology have emerged as major revenue generators and job providers for Kerala in recent decades, its agriculture and production sectors continue to lag. Low productivity levels compared to other States, small and fragmented production and supply chains, underdeveloped post-harvest facilities, labour shortages, and weak research extension have been identified among the “critical gaps” plaguing the farm sector. Citing land-use data for 2023-24, the Economic Review noted that out of the total geographical area of 38.86 lakh hectares, the total cultivated area and net area sown were 25.36 lakh hectares (65.3%) and 19.7 lakh hectares (50.8%), respectively. In the case of rice — Kerala’s staple food — the area under wetland paddy declined from 7.79 lakh hectares in 1960-61 to 1.79 lakh hectares in 2023-24, according to government data. “Moreover, the productivity of the crop is very low in the State (2,790 kg/hectare), though it is higher than the national average (2,424 kg/hectare). There has only been a marginal increase in the productivity of rice in the past four decades,” the State Planning Board noted.\nFisheries is key to Kerala’s economy, ranking third in seafood exports by volume and second by value, producing 5.81 lakh MT marine fish. The photo shows fishermen with fresh sardine catch at Shangumugham beach.\n| Photo Credit:\nNirmal Harindran\nWith its 590-km coastline, it is unsurprising that fisheries have long been central to Kerala’s economy. The State is currently the third-largest seafood exporter in the country by volume and the second-largest by value. In 2023-24, Kerala’s marine fish production reached 5.81 lakh metric tonnes (MT), while inland fish production stood at 2.51 lakh MT. During the same period, the State exported 1.97 lakh MT of seafood, amounting to ₹7,231.84 crore. However, the past few decades have been difficult for Kerala’s coastal communities. Severe coastal erosion, the effects of climate change, and declining fish stocks have placed them under immense strain. Most recently, Kerala’s seafood exports were among the first to be hit by revised U.S. tariff policies.\nA broader view of Kerala’s exports shows that the total value of goods shipped abroad increased from ₹25,441 crore in 2014-15 to ₹71,865 crore in 2019-20, before falling to ₹40,388 crore in 2024-25.\nBut when one gets down to brass tacks, it is, as the title of Colin Vearncombe’s (Black) song goes: All We Need Is The Money. Managing State finances has never been an easy task, but in recent years it has become particularly complex, according to States such as Kerala, which accuse the Union government of attempting to centralise powers. The overhaul of the tax regime and the States’ complaints about the skewed sharing of financial resources between the Centre and the States have sparked heated debates over the future of cooperative and fiscal federalism. In Kerala’s case, the State’s traditional emphasis on social welfare and its development plans are facing mounting pressure from a shrinking fiscal space. Furthermore, its share of the divisible pool fell from 3.88% under the 10th Finance Commission to 1.92% under the 15th Commission. The Left government has consistently blamed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Union government’s fiscal policies for the prolonged financial squeeze Kerala has been experiencing. Policies that drew the State’s ire include the decision to trim its borrowing space by treating the “off-budget borrowings” of the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) and the Kerala Social Security Pension Ltd. (KSSPL) as direct State debt, and the discontinuation of the GST compensation after the five-year period.\nThe biggest challenge faced by successive State governments in Kerala has been keeping expenditure down without undermining its pro-social sector fiscal policies. Salaries and pensions take away a huge chunk of the State’s revenues. Take, for instance, social security and welfare fund board pensions: close to 60 lakh people benefit from a monthly pension of ₹1,600. In June 2025, Finance Minister Balagopal stated that the LDF government — both the current administration and the previous one led by Pinarayi Vijayan — has spent ₹73,654 crore on these pensions. The present LDF government has spent ₹38,500 crore in its first four years. In his 2025–26 Budget, Balagopal noted that the government spends more than ₹11,000 crore a year on social security and welfare fund board pensions alone. Nearly two decades ago, the second Kerala Public Expenditure Review Committee, in its first report (2007–08), observed that Kerala’s salary and pension expenditure together constituted, on average, roughly 50% of total revenue expenditure. As salary expenditure accounted for more than one-third of the State’s revenue expenditure, it was advisable to contain their aggregate growth so that more resources could be channelled towards public services, the Committee had noted. This committed expenditure continues to make a significant claim on the State’s income. Salaries and pensions, as a percentage of total revenue expenditure, stood at 45% in 2022-23 and 2023-24.\nWithout doubt, a singular event that has had a deep impact on State finances and Kerala’s overall economy in recent years has been the introduction of the GST regime in 2017. In the 14th Five-Year Plan for the State (2022–2027), the Kerala State Planning Board observed that mobilising resources for the plan period would prove a “challenging task.” Under the new tax regime, Indian States ceded taxation rights on as much as 52% of their own tax revenues to the GST Council. “A comparison of the average annual growth rate of taxes subsumed by GST over the pre-GST years 2014-15 to 2016-17 with the growth of SGST and IGST settlement revenues during 2017-18 to 2019-20 reveals that the rates for Kerala fell significantly from 8.67% to 3.47%,” it noted. The Planning Board further observed that the attrition in Kerala’s own tax and non-tax revenues would make access to enhanced Central transfers to fund budgetary expenditure all the more important. This observation carries significant political and financial implications for the State. Although Kerala, along with other States, battled hard for an extension of GST compensation, citing the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Centre has not relented. On the other hand, the revamp of the State GST Department and tighter tax collection has yielded results for Kerala. The State’s Own Tax Revenues (SOTR) steadily improved from ₹47,661 crore in 2020-21 to ₹76,656 crore in 2024-25. Non-tax revenues grew from ₹7,327 crore to ₹16,568 crore during the same period.\nThe restructuring of Kerala’s GST Department and improved tax collection have paid dividends.

Mahinsha\nThe ‘KIIFB story’ has an important place in the recent development and financial landscape of the State. In June 2016, after the LDF government led by Pinarayi Vijayan was sworn in, the then Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac, an economist of note, presented a white paper on the state of State finances in the Legislative Assembly. Dr. Isaac’s White Paper roundly blamed the previous Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) government for grave financial mismanagement. Dr. Isaac had pointed to a negative cash balance in the treasury, neglect of deficit targets, and immediate liabilities amounting to ₹10,000 crore. The UDF government, the paper said, neither trimmed the rising expenditures nor increased revenues. In his white paper — which predictably caused a furore in the Opposition benches — Dr. Isaac posed three questions: How can Kerala increase its tax revenue by 20% to 25%? How can it slash revenue expenditure without such an action compromising the government’s spending on welfare and capital projects? Since it would take some years to bring the revenue deficit under check, how can the State accelerate capital expenditure without any delay? Dr. Isaac’s reply to the largely rhetorical third question was KIIFB, a financial entity that was originally established in 1999. What the LDF government under Dr. Isaac’s guidance did was to comprehensively amend the KIIFB Act, 1999, and incorporate provisions in the legal framework to equip KIIFB “to utilise innovative methods of raising finance authorised by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)” for funding infrastructure development. Going by the latest available data, KIIFB has so far approved 1,180 projects worth ₹89,941 crore. This includes 1,173 infrastructure projects totalling ₹69,941 crore and seven projects totalling ₹20,000 crore in the land acquisition pool. As of July 31, 2025, KIIFB has disbursed ₹36,160 crore to various projects.\nKIIFB, established in 1999, has significantly shaped the Kerala’s financial landscape. The photo shows Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan arriving for KIIFB’s 25th anniversary in Thiruvananthapuram, on November 4, 2025.\n| Photo Credit:\nNirmal Harindran\nIn September 2025, Finance Minister Balagopal flew to New Delhi to hand over a Supplementary Memorandum to the 16th Finance Commission. Kerala had presented its initial memorandum to the Commission headed by Arvind Panagariya when the panel visited Thiruvananthapuram in December 2024. Two developments in 2025 that threatened significant setbacks for its economy, however, had prompted Kerala to draft the supplementary memorandum; the first was the combined reciprocal and penal tariffs of 50% imposed by the United States’ Donald Trump administration on Indian goods. The second, a decision by the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council to revamp the tax structure into a two-tier one of 5% and 18%. To absorb the economic shock of the two developments, Kerala sought supplementary grants and eligibility for a “temporary extra borrowing limit” of 0.5% of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP). The GST rate rejig, Kerala feared, would sharply drop its annual revenues by ₹8,000 crore to ₹10,000 crore. On another front, Trump’s “tariff war” and the uncertainties that it entailed meant big trouble for Kerala whose export sector does big business with the U.S. in marine products, spices, textiles, coir and cashew. Such has been the concern over Trump’s tariffs that the Kerala State Planning Board and the Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation (GIFT), an autonomous institute under the State Finance Department, even organised a round table in August 2025 to discuss how the State should move forward. Balagopal wanted the Finance Commission to consider these developments and their impacts on the Kerala economy when drafting its recommendations.\nIn its initial memorandum to the Commission, Kerala had already urged the panel to raise the share of States in the divisible tax pool from the present 41% to 50% and rework the formula used for resource sharing among States. Kerala had also requested the Commission to frame recommendations for reducing the imbalances in resource sharing, noting that it faced a drastic cut in share from 3.88% under the 10th Finance Commission to 1.92% under the 15th Commission. These interactions with the Finance Commission are part of a larger, protracted struggle Kerala’s Left government, which is in its second successive term under Pinarayi Vijayan, has pursued in recent years. Two back-to-back flood disasters in 2018 and 2019 and the COVID-19 pandemic have placed State finances under immense strain. Kerala has repeatedly accused the BJP-led Central government of fiscal bias and deliberate, politically motivated attempts to choke it financially.\nA view of the Vizhinjam International Sea Port in Thiruvananthapuram, a facility that offers much hope for Kerala on the development front.\n| Photo Credit:\nNirmal Harindran\nAt the threshold of the second quarter of the 21st century, the Kerala economy faces a mix of unique challenges and promising opportunities. On the development front, the Vizhinjam International Seaport Ltd. in coastal Thiruvananthapuram — formally inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in May 2025 — offers much hope. As Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said at a recent Kerala-European Union conclave on the Blue Economy, Kerala “is striving to build a climate-resilient economy where green jobs and sustainable livelihoods emerge as the foundation of the State’s future.” The State has set ambitious goals: achieving 100% renewable-energy use by 2040 and becoming net carbon-neutral by 2050. Yet the hurdles are significant. A rapidly urbanising State with high population density, Kerala also confronts an ageing population and a declining fertility rate. These, the Economic Review 2024 notes, are reflected in environmental degradation, pressure on resources, rising unemployment, outmigration and demographic imbalances. At the same time, nationalisation drives in many countries — especially in the Gulf — and the rise of technologies such as artificial intelligence have reshaped the global labour market, triggering a wave of reverse migration. In September, Law and Industries Minister P. Rajeeve told the State Assembly, citing a LinkedIn report, that 40,000 Keralite professionals had returned home. While he framed this as an opportunity to tap their skills, critics argue that it also signals uncertainty for foreign remittances — a long-standing pillar of Kerala’s economy.\nAs this piece is being written, a heated political debate is under way over Kerala’s persistently high retail inflation. The State’s year-on-year inflation rate for August 2025 stood at 9.04%, the highest among major States, against the all-India rate of 2.07%, according to the Consumer Price Index data released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. Meanwhile, building climate resilience has become impossible to postpone. The back-to-back floods of 2018 and 2019, followed by a series of natural disasters — including the Wayanad landslides of July 30, 2024 — have claimed hundreds of lives. Recurring health emergencies, such as Nipah virus outbreaks and other zoonotic diseases, add to the strain. How Kerala navigates these challenges, while shaping new development models for progressive societies and for India as a whole, will be watched closely in the days to come.\nThis article is part of The Hindu e-book. Kerala: a model State’s paradox\nKerala\n/\nIndia",

There are hundreds like them who come to Dharwad with dreams of securing a government job as they believe that Dharwad with its “educational atmosphere” will help them study and crack the competitive examinations.\n“For long, Dharwad has been an education centre. Cashing in on the brand name of Dharwad, over 30 coaching centres have come up. After getting coaching for six months or so, these candidates turn to the around 150 study halls scattered in various localities,” said Bhavanishankar Gowda, State co-convener of Job Aspirants’ Struggle Committee.\nEvery day, hundreds of candidates — mostly graduates with a dream of government job — frequent these 24/7 study halls, marked by narrow cubicles and chairs. They spend days and nights there.\nWhile it is common for job aspirants from various districts of North Karnataka, including Koppal, Vijayapura, Raichur, Bidar, Ballari, Bagalkot, Kalaburagi, Haveri, and others, to depend on Dharwad for the exam preparations, of late, the affordability factor is drawing candidates from South Karnataka districts, including Kolar and Chickballapur.\nUnlike Mr. Naregal, whose family continues to support his dream albeit with some difficulty, not many candidates can afford to stay back for longer periods in Dharwad. In order to pursue their dream, they end up working part time, doing catering jobs, working as security guards, and in some extreme cases doing masonry work to meet expenses. Some get free food along with monthly wages for serving food in the mess.\n“There are hundreds who stay back, working part time and keep preparing only with the hope of cracking an examination. However desperation is creeping in because of the inordinate delay in recruitment,” Mr. Naregal said, adding that this angst among aspirants over the issue is valid.\n(This is the first of a three-part series)",

        "content": "Image for representative purposes only. File\n| Photo Credit: Getty Images/iStockphoto\nThe government has mandated the sale of petrol with up to 20% ethanol and a minimum Research Octane Number (RON) of 95 across all States and Union Territories from April 1, 2026.\nThe oil ministry in a February 17 notification, said, \"the central government hereby directs that oil companies shall sell ethanol-blended motor spirit (petrol) with percentage of ethanol up to 20% as per the Bureau of Indian Standards specifications and having minimum Research Octane Number (RON) of 95, in States and the Union Territories\".\nThe central government can allow exceptions in special situations, for specific regions and for a limited time.\nEthanol is made from sugarcane, maize, or grain. It is renewable, domestically produced and has cleaner burning than pure petrol.\nThe government has mandated ethanol blending in petrol to help cut oil imports as also reduce emissions. Such a mandate also supports farmers as it boosts demand for sugarcane, maize and agricultural surplus.\nMost vehicles manufactured in India from 2023-2025 onward are designed to run on E20 and no major issues are expected, industry officials said.\nOlder vehicles may however see a slight drop in mileage (3-7%). Also rubber/plastic component may wear.\nThe insistance on minimum RON 95 is to prevent engine damage.\nRON, or Research Octane Number, is a measure of a fuel's resistance to engine knocking (pre-ignition). Knocking happens when fuel burns unevenly inside the engine, causing pinging sound, loss of power and possible engine damage over time.\nThe higher the RON, the more resistant the fuel is to knocking.\nIn simple terms, octane is like a fuel's 'self-control under pressure' - higher RON means fuel stays stable under high compression.\nEthanol naturally has high octane value (around 108 RON). Blending 20% ethanol in petrol, increases knock resistance.\nEncouraged by India achieving 10% ethanol doping in petrol in June 2022 — five months ahead of the target date -— the government advanced 20% blending to 2025-26 from 2030. Most pumps in the country now sell E20 or petrol blended with 20 per cent ethanol.\nAccording to the oil ministry, since 2014-15 India has saved more than ₹1.40 lakh crore in foreign exchange through petrol substitution.\nIndia\n/\neconomy, business and finance\n/\ndiesel fuel",

In the 24-hour stalemate, the Delhi Police team was “detained” for about five hours even after procuring the transit remand from the ACJM.\nOn Wednesday (February 25, 2026), the Himachal Pradesh Police registered a kidnapping case against the Delhi Police personnel and \"detained\" their vehicles at the Shogi border near Shimla. This occurred while they were en route to the national capital with the three Youth Congress members in custody.\nThe three accused, along with the members of the Delhi Police, were taken to the residence of ACJM II Ekansh Kapil at 1.30 a.m. after undergoing medical examinations at the Deendyal Upadhyay Zonal Hospital in Shimla late Wednesday (February 25, 2026) night. Afterwards, they resumed their journey.\nHowever, early Thursday (February 26, 2026) morning, the Delhi Police team was detained again at Kanlog. The police team was instructed to return to the national capital with the accused, along with a few additional police personnel, while the remaining members were asked to to stay behind and cooperate with the investigation into the kidnapping case against them.\nThe Shimla police also asked the Delhi team to hand over the copy of the digital evidence they possessed, which had allegedly been gathered when they picked up the activists in Rohru.\nThe Delhi Police insisted that the safety of the three accused was their responsibility and that they would not leave any of their members behind. They later continued their movement towards Shoghi.\nAt the Shoghi border, however, the Delhi team was detained yet again by the Shimla police at 4 a.m..\tMeanwhile, the Shimla police barricaded a vehicle belonging to the Delhi Police, which is believed to contain CCTV footage and other evidence. The Delhi Police stated that this vehicle holds digital evidence, accompanying documents, and arms.\nDuring the standoff, the Shimla police sought the keys to the barricaded vehicle, but the Delhi Police refused to hand them over.\nA personnel from the Delhi Police informed the Shimla police that a seizure memo had been provided and that the relevant documents were shown to the ACJM, based on which they were granted transit remand.\nThe Delhi Police stated that they received 18 hours of transit remand, of which 4.5 hours have already elapsed.\nBoth the Delhi and Shimla police teams declined to comment to the media. The information about the standoff was gathered based on what the PTI reporter at the scene observed and heard. Speaking to the media earlier, advocate for the accused, Sandeep Dutta, stated that the arrest was illegal because the proper procedures were not followed. He opposed the transit remand on the grounds of illegal detention and the lack of proper documentation.\nAdvocate Nand Lal, representing the Delhi Police, stated that the transit remand application was presented and approved.\nThe conflict began on Wednesday (February 25, 2026) morning when members of the Delhi Police arrested the three Youth Congress activists, linked to the February 20 protest at the AI Impact Summit, from a hotel in the Chirgaon area of Rohru subdivision in Shimla district. They were intercepted by local police and brought back to Shimla.\nThree police vehicles ferrying the accused — Saurabh, Siddharth and Arbaz — who are allegedly not residents of the State, were intercepted in Shimla and Solan district and subsequently produced before a local court.\nOn Wednesday (February 25, 2026) evening, when the Delhi Police attempted once more to transport the accused to New Delhi, they were stopped again at the Shoghi border, approximately 15 km from Shimla. This situation created inconvenience for commuters due to the standoff between the two police teams.\n\"A case has been registered against 15-20 unknown people in plain clothes for forcibly taking three people staying in a resort in Rohru. They also took the CCTV installed in the resort with them and did not give any receipt,\" the Shimla police said in a statement.\nWhile the Delhi Police asserted that they had obtained the necessary transit remand, the Himachal Police claimed that no documentation was presented and deemed the operation illegal, alleging a procedural lapse in not notifying the local police before making an arrest.\nBoth the Shimla and Delhi police accused one another of obstructing the investigation.\nIn a purported video that appeared from the Shogi border in the suburbs of Shimla city, the Delhi Police officers were heard saying that they had arrested three people in the morning in connection with an FIR registered on February 20.\n\"We have to produce the accused arrested at 5 a.m. today in the court in 24 hours, and you have stopped us after registering an FIR at 8 p.m.,\" a Delhi Police officer could be heard saying.\nHowever, Shimla Police maintained that a case of abduction had been filed, alleging that the Delhi Police was hampering their investigation. \"I asked you for legal documentation in the morning, but you neither showed any document nor provided the FIR number,\" a Shimla Police officer could be heard replying. In a statement issued in Shimla, Leader of Opposition in the Himachal Pradesh Assembly Jai Ram Thakur said, \"It is shameful to provide protection in Himachal Pradesh to individuals from outside Himachal Pradesh who have attempted to tarnish the country's image internationally.\" Mr. Thakur accused Chief Minister Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu of engaging in 'politics of anarchy' to win favour with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, claiming the Himachal Pradesh Police should have cooperated with the Delhi Police in this interstate operation, but instead attempted to detain them.\nThe \"shirtless protest\" at Bharat Mandapam on February 20 prompted a significant security response, with police earlier invoking charges including rioting and promoting enmity under relevant provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).\nThe Indian Youth Congress (IYC) president, Uday Bhanu Chib, and former national spokesperson, Bhudev Sharma, were arrested in connection with the case on Tuesday (February 24, 2026). Both were subsequently produced before a Delhi court and remanded to police custody for interrogation.\nAccording to the Delhi Police, a total of 11 people have been arrested so far.\nOn Saturday (February 21, 2026) midnight, Delhi Police raided Himachal Sadan in the national capital amid reports that IYC workers who had participated in the protest were provided accommodation there.\nHimachal Pradesh Chief Minister Sukhu termed the action \"unfortunate and against constitutional procedure.\"\nArtificial Intelligence\n/\npolitics\n/\nIndia\n/\nIndia",

        "content": "Rajasthan CM Bhajan Lal Sharma. File picture\n| Photo Credit: Emmanual Yogini\nAhead of the local body elections, the Rajasthan Cabinet on Wednesday (February 25, 2026) approved the removal of legal provisions prohibiting persons with more than two children from contesting the Panchayati Raj and urban local body elections. The restriction has been in place in the State for nearly 30 years.\nTwo Amendment Bills for the purpose will be introduced in the ongoing Budget session of the Rajasthan Assembly, the State’s Parliamentary Affairs Minister Jogaram Patel said here after the Cabinet meeting. The move reverses a provision introduced in 1995 during the government led by former Chief Minister Bhairon Singh Shekhawat.\n“The two-child norm was originally introduced as a population control measure. It has lost its relevance now, as the fertility rate has declined to 2, against 3.6 during 1991-94,” Mr. Patel said. The provision had become “outdated” following a considerable change witnessed in socio-political sphere over the years, he added.\nCandidates with more than two children will now be eligible to contest panchayat and municipal elections in the State. The Cabinet approved bringing the Bills for amending Section 19 of the Rajasthan Panchayati Raj Act, 1994, and Section 24 of the Rajasthan Municipalities Act, 2009.\nMr. Patel said both the Bills would be passed in the current Assembly session. As a major step in electoral reforms, the scrapping of the two-child norm is likely to have a direct impact on the forthcoming panchayat and urban local body polls.\nThe Opposition Congress strongly criticised the State Cabinet’s decision, saying the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was following the directive of its ideological fountainhead, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which has been asking Hindus to have more children. RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat recently suggested that Hindu families should consider having at least three children.\nPradesh Congress Committee president Govind Singh Dotasra said the BJP, on the one hand, advises a particular community to control population growth, and repeals the two-child norm on the other. “The BJP government should clarify its stand on whether it supports population control or follows the RSS’s diktat,” he said.\nHowever, several social organisations and public representatives have in the past sought the removal of the two-child norm, contending that the rule was discriminatory and inconsistent with democratic principles. The grassroots leaders earlier disqualified under the rule will now be able to contest elections in villages and urban wards.\nIn other decisions, the State Cabinet approved the formation of a Directorate of Revenue Intelligence and Economic Offences; establishment of an ayurveda, yoga and naturopathy university in Ajmer; adoption of an industrial park promotion policy; and clearance of a revised financial model for the proposed Rajasthan Mandapam and Global Capability Centre in Jaipur.\nRajasthan\n/\nfamily",

File picture\nHours after the Supreme Court of India registered a suo motu case on Wednesday (February 25, 2026) over the inclusion of a section on “corruption” in the judiciary in the NCERT’s newest Social Science textbook for Class 8, the National Council for Educational Research and Training issued a statement apologising for the “inappropriate textual material” and “error in judgement” that had “inadvertently crept” into the chapter in question.\nOfficials said directions had been issued on February 24 (Tuesday) to keep the distribution of this book on “strict hold until further orders”. On Wednesday morning, the Supreme Court registered the suo motu case, calling the section “a selective reference”, even as the NCERT apologised in its statement later that night saying “it regrets this error of judgement”.\nA three-judge Bench of Chief Justice of India Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M. Pancholi is scheduled to hear the case titled ‘In Re: Social Science Textbook for Grade-8 (Part 2) published by NCERT and ancillary issues’ at 10.30 a.m. on February 26.\nThe chapter ‘The Role of the Judiciary in Our Society’ in the Class 8 Social Science book prescribed by NCERT mentions that corruption, a massive backlog of cases, and a lack of adequate number of judges were among the “challenges” faced by the judicial system. The section on “corruption in the judiciary” in the book states that judges were bound by a code of conduct that governed not only their behaviour in court but also how they conducted themselves outside of it.\nIn its statement, the NCERT said the textbook was brought out “as per extant procedure”, adding that the “inappropriate textual material” and “error in judgement” had been “observed” “on receiving the textbook”. It said that the Department of School Education also made similar observations.\nGovernment officials said the direction to stop the distribution of the book was issued by the Department of School Education and Literacy on February 24 (Tuesday). In the statement, the NCERT said the directions “had been complied with”.\n“The National Council of Educational Research & Training (NCERT) holds the judiciary in highest esteem and considers it to be the upholder of the Indian Constitution and protector of Fundamental Rights. The aforesaid error is purely unintentional and NCERT regrets the inclusion of inappropriate material in the said chapter,” the NCERT said in the statement.\nThe NCERT said that the objective of the new textbook is to “strengthen constitutional literacy, institutional respect, and informed understanding of democratic participation amongst students”, adding that “there is no intent to question or diminish the authority of any constitutional body”.\nIt said that since NCERT remains “open to constructive feedback” as “part of its continuous review process”, the material in question “shall be re-written, with consultation of the appropriate authority, as necessary, and would be made available to students of Class 8 accordingly on the commencement of academic session 2026-27”.\nThe NCERT reiterated its “resolve to continuously work for institutional sanctity and respect”.\neducation\n/\nschool\n/\njudiciary (system of justice)",

Following a detailed infertility work-up, doctors initiated medical ovulation induction. As there was no adequate response, she was taken up for IVF.\nShe was monitored throughout the antenatal period and was admitted with preterm onset of labour, following which an emergency lower-segment caesarean section was performed on February 7. She delivered a female baby weighing 2 kilograms. The newborn was shifted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for monitoring in view of prematurity and was later kept with the mother under paediatric supervision. Both the mother and the baby are currently doing well.\nThis case comes amid a steady expansion of infertility services at government healthcare institutions in Telangana over the past year. IVF centres were inaugurated at Gandhi Hospital and the Modern Government Maternity Hospital (MGHM) Petlaburj in late 2024 with services ranging from infertility evaluation to assisted reproductive technologies. Overall, infertility services at these two institutions have resulted in 190 positive cases through a combination of ovulation induction, IUI and IVF treatments.\nFrom the inception of these services to January 2026, the two centres together registered 8,359 new infertility outpatients and 19,013 review cases, taking the total outpatient visits to 27,372. During this period, 568 hysterosalpingography procedures (X-ray tests to assess the uterus and fallopian tubes) and 14,033 follicular studies (ultrasound scans used to monitor ovulation) were conducted as part of infertility assessment.\nMedical ovulation induction was provided to 3,004 women, of whom 159 tested positive for pregnancy. Gandhi Hospital carried out 1,550 ovulation induction procedures, recording 56 positive cases, while MGMH Petlaburz conducted 1,454 procedures with 103 positive outcomes.\nIntrauterine insemination procedures (a fertility treatment in which sperm is placed directly into the uterus) also saw significant uptake, with 366 IUIs performed across the two hospitals, resulting in 19 positive cases. Gandhi Hospital conducted 32 IUI procedures, of which 2 were successful, while MGMH Petlaburj accounted for 334 procedures and 17 positive cases.\nAdvanced IVF-related interventions were gradually scaled up. A total of 97 IVF stimulation cycles were performed, leading to 100 ovum pickups and 48 embryo transfers. These resulted in 12 IVF-positive cases, with Gandhi Hospital reporting seven and MGMH Petlaburj reporting five.",

        "content": "Kerala government has granted KINFRA permission to independently raise loans up to ₹1,000 crore for land acquisition and infrastructure development, Industries Minister P. Rajeeve has said.\nSpeaking at the foundation stone-laying ceremony for KINFRA’s new headquarters in Thiruvananthapuram on Wednesday, the Minister explained that while the agency previously relied on financial mechanisms like Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB), the government will now provide a guarantee to facilitate these independent loans. This new financial flexibility will be prioritized for acquiring land for industrial projects associated with the Vizhinjam Port, he said.\nAddressing the challenges of industrial expansion, Mr. Rajeeve also noted that while many investors are eager to enter the State, the availability of land remains a hurdle. Significant portions of land held by Central Public Sector Undertakings—such as FACT, HMT, and Hindustan Newsprint—currently lie idle. Mentioning the Palakkad Coach Factory site in Kanjikode, which is increasingly becoming overgrown, he said that such properties be handed over to the State government for more efficient utilization.\nThe Minister warned the entrepreneurs who have acquired KINFRA land but left it undeveloped for years, that the government would have to take decisive action if projects do not commence promptly. The new KINFRA headquarters is being constructed on 22 cents of land at Edappazhinji, marking a major milestone 33 years after the organization’s inception. The event also featured the exchange of a Memorandum of Understanding for a newly completed IT building at the Kazhakuttam Film and IT Park. Following the 2022 handover of a 200,000-sq.-ft. facility to Tata Elxsi, KINFRA has now delivered an additional 177,000-sq.ft. “plug and play” campus to the company to meet its expanding operational needs.",

It is scheduled from April 1 to September 30 in all States and Union Territories.\nThe second phase is population enumeration, when the demographic, socio-economic, cultural, and caste details are to be collected. It will be conducted in February 2027.\nQuestions on caste for the Census will be notified before the second phase: Home Ministry to Parliament\nIn a first, private technical staff to assist officials in Census\nSC refuses to entertain PIL questioning procedures to record caste of citizens in 2027 census\nCensus 2027 | Caste methodology yet to be decided, clarity likely by July\nThe communication to the States said that the ensuing Census 2027 will make extensive use of digital technology to enhance the quality, efficiency, and timeliness of data collection and dissemination. “Data will be collected through digital mode, marking a significant and transformative step towards the modernisation of the census process,” it said.\nThe CMMS will facilitate end-to-end management of the entire census operations, including the creation of users at various levels, handling of training modules, creation of house listing blocks (HLBs) and supervisory circles, the generation of appointment letters and ID cards of enumerators and supervisors, and the near real-time monitoring of field operations.\nIn addition, the Houselisting Block Creator (HLBC) Web Mapping Application has been developed as an integrated component of the CMMS to facilitate geo-tagging and demarcation of HLBs. Each HLB is expected to cover around 700-800 people.\nFor the first time in census operations, “working maps” shall be generated through the HLBC App with the latest available satellite imagery to enable clear identification of habitations and settlements.\nThe RG&CCI said that in “some of the States where proper and accurate village/town boundaries are not available, for example, northeastern States, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Chhattisgarh, etc., the village locations (points) have been updated using various geospatial data sources such as Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) and Bharat Maps (NIC) that are available in the public domain.”\nThe enumerators will use their personal phones to collect the data on the App created for the HLO phase.\nCensus 2027\n/\npopulation and census\n/\nIndia",

        "title": "Budgeting and the social contract in urban India",
        "content": "Image for representation only\n| Photo Credit: EMMANUAL YOGINI\n“Every man having been born free and master of himself, no one else may under any pretext whatever, subject him without his consent”....“As soon as any man says of the affairs of the State “What does it matter to me?” the State may be given up for lost.”\nThese selected quotes from the 18th century political philosopher Jean Jacques Rousseau encapsulate his version of the social contract theory, the hypothesis in political science that a state came into being owing to agreement among free individuals to create and sustain a structure for the benefit of all, with attendant rights and obligations for all participating entities. Earlier versions were proposed by Thomas Hobbes (in the state of nature, man’s life was solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short; social contract allows man to enter civil society) and John Locke (men willingly agree to form a commonwealth; however, there can be no subjugation to power without consent and obedience is conditional on protection of the natural rights of the individual.)\nThis happy conceit of the social contract is also invoked by the Economic Survey 2025-2026, particularly in the context of urban areas and its residents.\nThe Economic Survey 2025-2026, released on January 29, dedicated a chapter to examining the issues plaguing urban India. Traffic congestion and mobility, housing challenges, sanitation and the fast-expanding informalisation of urban workers and spaces all find mention in the 700-plus pages of the Survey, released ahead of the Budget presentation on Sunday, February 1.\nOne section is dedicated to a particular aspect of urban life: the denizens and their willingness to comply with norms. The Survey describes civic order without a social contract as an invisible fault line in Indian cities. Noting that shortcomings in urban life are attributed to institutional capacity, the authors note that “the quality of everyday life is also shaped by the implicit social contract between citizens and urban institutions”\nHighlighting that the lived experience in cities is not influenced only by infrastructure gaps but also by the “credibility of rules, the predictability of services, and the trust that underpins everyday cooperation,” the Survey states that global and Indian cities differ less due to engineering and more about whether the existing institutions “make co-operation rational and worthwhile.”\nThe survey notes that programmes such as Swachh Bharat Abhiyan sought to combine infrastructure developments with behaviour-change efforts. These included attempts by states to increase communication with the public and seek their participation. In some cases. the incentives were legal, such as bans on spitting and littering, and notified spot fines under Solid Waste Management bylaws. There was also an attempt to increase funding support and environmental enforcement. The outcomes however, have remained uneven in cities and neighbourhoods, the Survey says, attributing this to “a fragile social contract” rather than “awareness or values.”\n“Where enforcement is inconsistent, service delivery unreliable, and penalties uncertain, compliance becomes contingent. When rules are applied unevenly, cooperation gives way to individual calculation,” the authors state. This can be seen in the contrast between public spaces, which are neglected, and private spaces, which receive great attention and investment from Indians.\nIf services are predictable and responsive, taxes and rules are seen as part of the shared system. If they are not, civic engagement is weakened. The public will not invest effort in common assets if there is limited confidence that “collective restraint will be matched by collective benefit,” the Survey notes.\nHence large investments in urban infrastructure have not translated into improvements in the urban experience, the Survey says, citing an India Today civic survey which measures Gross Domestic Behaviour. This survey shows contradictory individual approaches to morality and action. “Civic Behaviour (within the citizens) reflects a blend of contradictions, where individuals acknowledge the importance of public responsibility but often struggle to uphold those values when faced with personal gain or convenience,” the India Today analysis cites.\nCivic order is best understood as an institutional equilibrium rather a cultural trait, the Survey’s authors note. They refer to global cities like Singapore, Tokyo, London and New York, stating that they institutionalise co-operation through design, certainty and credible enforcement, demonstrated through factors such as clear rules, proportionate penalties, quality municipal services, and good urban design\n“Over time, these systems reduce the need for constant exhortation because cooperation is embedded in everyday governance,” the Survey claims, saying that the lack of operational capacity, regulatory tools and financial autonomy to ensure such outcomes is what leads to a weakening of the civic order and social contract. Then, civic order may become dependent on campaigns, with limited and unpredictable levels of success.\nThe Survey highlights yet another challenge with enforcement: lack of institutional coordination. This can be seen in fragmented or poorly demarcated authority structures in urban local bodies, with low administrative autonomy. This in turn, guts accountability for implementation of certain rules across important domains such as public health, street order and traffic, and solid waste.\n“Aligning mandates, clarifying ownership of outcomes, and insulating routine enforcement from ad-hoc intervention are therefore central to making rule certainty credible in everyday urban governance,” the authors note.\nThe institutional coordination mentioned in the Economic Survey becomes crucial given the multi-tiered nature of who is responsible for various aspects of urban life. Most urban issues are deeply local (sanitation, public health, water, roads) and some are either State subjects or on the concurrent list. However, some areas affecting the daily life of citizens are directly under the control of the Central government.\nFor example, individual States are responsible for police, prisons, public health and sanitation, hospitals and dispensaries, local self-government and municipal corporations, water supplies, land, industries, entertainment and sports, taxes and estate duties on agricultural land, and professional tax.\nOn the concurrent list are items such as economic and social planning, population control and family planning, trade unions, social security and social insurance, employment and unemployment, labour welfare, education, legal and medical professions, price control, factories, and electricity.\nBut several Items that intersect with the lives of daily citizens fall under the mandate of the central government: railways, national highways, nationals waterways, airways, the post and telegraph, banking, insurance, and income tax.\nQuoting the recommendations of the 16th Finance Commission, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Union Budget speech highlighted that the vertical share of devolution has been retained at 41% between States and Centre, and Rs. 1.4 lakh crore have been granted to the States for FY 2026-27 as Finance Commission Grants, including Rural and Urban Local Body and Disaster Management Grants.  The 16th Finance Commission report had been tabled by the Finance Minister in the Lok Sabha on the same day as the Union Budget (February 1, 2026.)\nThe Finance Commission had recommended an allocation of Rs. 3.5 lakh crore to urban local governments (ULGs) over the next five years, devolved via transfers by the Central and State governments in the form of grants. This marked a 230% increase over the amount recommended by the 15th Finance Commission, which was ₹1.5 lakh crore for the years 2021-26.\nPer an analysis by The Hindu Data team, the Commission allocated 45% of local government grants to ULGs, an increase from its previous share of 36%. Of these, 60% of the grants to ULGs were basic grants. From this amount, “tied” grants must be used for basic services like sanitation and water supply. “Untied” grants can be used for “location-specific felt needs, except for salary or establishment expenses.”\nIn her budget speech, Ms. Sitharaman also highlighted that the government will “continue to focus on developing infrastructure in cities with over 5 lakh population (Tier II and Tier III), which have expanded to become growth centres.“ Tier II and Tier III cities, and temple-towns, “which need modern infrastructure and basic amenities,” will be front and centre, she said.\nThe budget aimed to amplify the potential of cities to deliver the economic power of agglomerations by mapping city economic regions (CER), based on their specific growth drivers, Ms. Sitharaman said. She announced a proposed  allocation of Rs. 5000 crore per CER over 5 years for “implementing their plans through a challenge mode with a reform-cum-results based financing mechanism.”\nAnother offering for urban-dwelling India is seven High-Speed Rail corridors between cities as ‘growth connectors’: between Mumbai-Pune, Pune-Hyderabad, Hyderabad-Bengaluru, Hyderabad-Chennai, Chennai-Bengaluru, Delhi-Varanasi, and Varanasi-Siliguri.\nPublic capital expenditure is also channelled into big-ticket infrastructure projects, although it is not confined to urban areas. For this, the allocation was increased from Rs. 11.2 lakh crore in BE 2025-26 to Rs. 12.2 lakh crore in FY 2026-27.\nHowever, an analysis for The Hindu by Tikender Singh Panwar, former Deputy Mayor of Shimla and current member of the Kerala Urban Commission,  noted that the total central outlay for urban development has fallen by more than Rs. 11,000 crores from Rs. 96,777 crore in the previous year to Rs. 85,522 crore in 2026-27, amounting to a 11.6% reduction.\nFurther, urban spending is skewed. Metro rail projects take up a huge share of urban allocations, amounting to about a third of all central urban spending, standing at Rs. 28,740 crore of the Rs. 85,522 crore. This too, is a cut of roughly 8%, as the allocation for metro and mass rapid transit projects declined from ₹31,239.28 crore\n.\nThe article also notes that allocations for flagship urban schemes have been cut. For example, the allocation for the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) (PMAY-U) has declined from Rs. 19,794 crore to Rs. 18,625 crore, a cut of almost 5.9% cut. The Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban) (SBM-U) has been hit by a 50% cut— from an allocation of  Rs. 5,000 crore to Rs. 2,500 crore. The Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) scheme faced a 20% cut, from Rs. 10,000 crore to Rs. 8,000 crore.\nFurther, mere investment is unlikely to foster public trust if upkeep and safety are not prioritised. An example is the recent collapse of a Metro 4 line slab in Mulund, which killed one and injured four, which prompted National Spokesperson of the NCP-SP Clyde Crasto to say that the “life of a Mumbaikar holds no value for this BJP led Maharashtra Government.”\nThe aim of the fund is to support transformative and bankable projects through a “transparent and competitive” challenge-mode. It will be operational from FY 2025-26 to FY 2030-31 and cover most cities across the country. This includes all cities with a population of Rs. 10 lakh or more; any capital cities of States or Union territories that don’t meet this standard, and major industrial cities which have a population of one lakh or more. Further, all urban local bodies in hilly States and in northeastern States, and smaller urban local bodies with a population below 1 lakh will be eligible for support under the Credit Repayment Guarantee Scheme.\nNoting that urban infrastructure costs cannot be funded by public finance alone, the scheme envisages central assistance for 25% of project costs, provided a minimum of 50% of the project cost is raised through the market, which includes  municipal bonds, bank loans, and public-private partnerships. The press release announcing the scheme’s launch notes that the expected total investment in the urban sector over the next five years is Rs. 4 lakh crore.\nPrivate sector participation will be encouraged through structured risk-sharing frameworks; the fund will allot a dedicated ₹5,000 crore corpus, which will enhance the creditworthiness of 4,223 cities, including Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, particularly for first-time access to market finance.\nThe government said the fund signalled a shift from grant-based financing to market-linked, reform-driven and outcome-oriented  infrastructure-creation in the field of urban development. It aimed to build resilient, productive, inclusive and climate-responsive cities.\nEconomic Survey\n/\nurban planning\n/\nbudgets and budgeting",

        "content": "WhatsApp parent Meta appears to be testing code in “beta” versions of the app that would show users a message saying that Indian regulations require the company to check if their SIM is still in the device. File\n| Photo Credit: Reuters\nCommunications Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said on Wednesday that the SIM-binding directions from November 2025 would remain in force. This would require messaging apps, WhatsApp being the largest one, to do two things: forcibly log out users on services like WhatsApp Web every six hours and stop functioning if the user does not have the registered SIM provisioned on their device.  February 28 is the deadline for compliance.\nMr. Scindia said these rules had been implemented for national security and anti-fraud reasons. “As of now, there is no thought on an extension” for compliance with the rules, Mr. Scindia said in response to a query from The Hindu during a press interaction. “The logout thing [after six hours] is only for multiple connections on the same instrument, when you go to your computer and so on and so forth … The rules stand as is at this point, and the reasons for that are very well-founded, which all of you are aware, not only from a fraud aspect, but also from a security aspect.”\nWhatsApp parent Meta appears to be testing code in “beta” versions of the app that would show users a message saying that Indian regulations require the company to check if their SIM is still in the device. It is unclear whether the company also plans to comply with the six-hour logout period, which, its industry association, IAMAI, warned the government would be disruptive for professionals who rely on WhatsApp Web and for families that share a single WhatsApp account.\n“There are some issues which are national security issues and there are some issues which are revenue implication issues,” Mr. Scindia said. “On national security issues, there can be no compromise.”\nOn the long-awaited launch of the satellite Internet service Starlink, Mr. Scindia said that the SpaceX-owned firm has yet to complete its security demonstrations for the government using the “sample spectrum” it has been given for that purpose.\nMr. Scindia added that arrangements would also have to be made for the assignment of spectrum to Starlink, but he hoped that the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) would be able to arrange that before Starlink completes its demonstrations. The demonstrations to security agencies likely involve the firm showing that it can provide access to its Indian users’ networks, disable user terminals outside Indian borders, and switch off access when ordered to.\nMr. Scindia also condemned the “shocking” demands and arrangements linked to a BSNL Director’s proposed visit to Prayagraj. He said that a show-cause notice had been issued and that action “will be taken”.\nEarlier this week, an office order detailing massive personnel and material arrangements for Vivek Banzal, went viral. The order involved around 50 personnel being assigned tasks to ensure that Mr. Banzal would be attended to during a visit to Prayagraj.\nMr. Scindia said the order was “unbecoming and unacceptable”. “We won’t just let this go,” Mr. Scindia said. “It is shocking... it is unacceptable that in 21st century India such an order was issued.”\nRegarding BSNL’s financial performance, Mr. Scindia said the state-owned telco was generating “healthy cash flows”.\ntechnology (general)",

The Bill hands over the funding power to “mechanisms devised by the Ministry of Education”.\nThe 31-member JPC is headed by BJP MP D. Purandeswari. In a communication to the JPC ahead of its first meeting on Thursday, the government explained the background to the Bill and its provisions.\nThe Bill intends to subsume the UGC, AICTE, and the NCTE, by repealing the laws under which these bodies were set up. The commission will include separate regulatory, standards, and accreditation councils.\nThe government said the Bill evolved from Budget announcements in 2019-20. It had proposed the establishment of the VBSA under entry 66 of the Union List in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. It further noted that the plans for this reform had been laid out in the National Education Policy (NEP), 2020, which was brought in after wide consultations.\nThe VBSA Bill was introduced by Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan in Parliament in December 2025, even as MPs from across Opposition parties opposed it. They said the Bill represented “executive overreach”, subjected higher educational institutes to “pervasive executive control, graded autonomy, intrusive compliance requirements, severe penalties, and closure powers”; and went against the principles of federalism.\nSoon after the Bill’s introduction, the government said it would be examined by a JPC, which was constituted earlier this month.\nSources told The Hindu that the government, in its communication to the panel, explained the rationale behind separating the grant disbursal powers from the regulatory authority, saying that this was needed to remove potential conflict of interest, and to ensure transparency.\nAt the JPC meeting on Thursday, officials of the Education Ministry and the Ministry of Law and Justice (Legislative Department) are expected to brief the panel members on the VBSA Bill.\neducation\n/\nlaws\n/\nparliament",

This valve is crucial for firing the engine to raise the spacecraft’s orbit.\nThe committee said the most likely explanation was that at least one connection in the electrical connector — in both the primary and backup lines — came loose or failed, preventing the signal from getting through.\nNVS-02, the second spacecraft in the NVS series, was placed successfully into an ‘elliptical transfer’ orbit on January 29, 2025 at 00:53 UT but its subsequent transfer to a circular orbit was unsuccessful. This was also a special occasion being the 100th launch from the Sriharikota launchpad. The spacecraft was separated from the launch vehicle (GSLVF15) following which a series of autonomous activities on the satellite were carried out, including deploying the solar panel and stabilising the orientation for power generation.\nThe NVS-02 was to be the second satellite in the NVS series, and part of India’s Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC).\nThe committee, an ISRO statement said, gave a set of recommendations to “enhance” the redundancy and reliability of pyro system operations for future missions. These were “successfully implemented in CMS-03 spacecraft launched on November 2, 2025 by LVM-3 M5, and the pyro systems performed satisfactorily placing the satellite in the intended orbit.”\nThe CMS-03, or GSAT-7R, is an indigenously designed and developed satellite, weighing approximately 4,400 kg — India’s heaviest communication satellite — and is critical to the Navy’s space-based communications and maritime domain awareness.\nThe Hindu reported this week that a committee that includes K.

        "content": "The Enforcement Directorate (ED), Kochi zonal office, has provisionally attached properties worth around ₹32 lakh in Kasaragod belonging to a couple and their son in connection with an alleged overseas loan fraud and money laundering case.\nThe properties, registered in the names of Sulaiman C.T., Nafeesath O.T., and Muhammed Sinan Sulaiman, were attached through an order dated February 24, 2026 under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, said a communication from the agency.\nThe ED initiated the probe based on a case registered by the Chandera police on a complaint by Invest Bank PSC. The ED alleged that Abdurahiman Chenoth Thiruthummal, proprietor of Hexa Oil & Gas Services LLC, availed loans totalling 68.159 million AED (approximately 168.63 crore) from the UAE-based bank between 2013 and 2017 by submitting false financial statements and misrepresenting the purpose of funds.\nThough sanctioned for business development, a substantial portion was allegedly diverted to India, including ₹4.6 crore credited to his NRE account. Of this, ₹34 lakh was transferred in tranches to his brother Sulaiman between April 2014 and March 2017, allegedly for constructing a house in Kasaragod.\nIn 2022, Mr. Sulaiman transferred most of the property to his wife and son for ₹4.5 lakh. The ED termed the transaction a sham, suspecting it was meant to shield proceeds of the crime. Further investigation is under way, the agency said.",

        "content": "Booth-level campaign by the DMK women’s wing at Ramachandra Nagar in Tiruchi on Wednesday.\n| Photo Credit: M. MOORTHY\nOn a humid afternoon in Ramachandra Nagar in Tiruchi West constituency, a small group of women knock on doors carrying cloth bags filled with booklets — part campaign material, part household diary. But this is not a routine political visit.\nWhen residents scan a QR code inside the booklet, Chief Minister M.K. Stalin appears on their phone screens through augmented reality, seemingly addressing them from their living room.\nThe scene captures the evolving character of the DMK’s “Vellum Tamil Pengal” campaign — a statewide, women-led booth-level mobilisation effort that combines traditional door-to-door outreach with digital tools, signaling a new strategy to consolidate women voters while expanding women’s role within the party structure.\nAcross Tamil Nadu’s 75,032 polling booths, the party has formed a “Magalir Padai” — a committee of 10 women per booth — tasked exclusively with reaching households, explaining government schemes, and building local networks. A dedicated digital coordinator monitors the campaign, with WhatsApp groups and training sessions held over weekends to prepare cadres on communication and outreach.\n“For the first time, we are heading the campaign without men,” said M. Kavitha, Tiruchi Central district women’s wing organising secretary, speaking during a visit to Ward 62. “Earlier, door-to-door work was led by men. Women would be asked to carry flags or stand behind. Now it is a campaign for and by women — that itself is empowering.”\nCadres say the reception has largely been positive, especially among women familiar with welfare schemes. “We talk about women-centric programmes, clarify doubts, and also explain our political position,” Ms. Kavitha said, adding that conversations often extend beyond politics to household concerns.\nRunning a small roadside dosa stall herself, she pointed to a recurring theme in these interactions. “Schemes have helped many of us, but creating government jobs must remain a priority. Stable employment is what truly lifts families out of poverty,” she said.\nResidents echo the sentiment that the tone of engagement feels different. V. Kalaichaselvi, who hosted a group of campaign volunteers, said the visit made politics feel more accessible. “It was nice to see a group of women come home and talk calmly. Politics no longer feels intimidating,” she said.\nA senior DMK functionary said the model is intended to “build leadership skills among women cadres while creating a more intimate connect with women voters who may not speak freely in mixed gatherings.”\nThe campaign follows a carefully choreographed process. Volunteers first introduce themselves and hand over a booklet that lists government schemes alongside practical tools — emergency helpline numbers, space for noting contacts, a household budget planner, diary pages, motivational quotes and a calendar.\nResidents are then invited to scan a QR code that launches an augmented reality video of the Chief Minister addressing women directly, acknowledging their contributions and urging continued support for welfare initiatives.\nThe campaign, which began on February 23, is being carried out in intensive phases, with volunteers covering roughly 20 houses a day to ensure all booths are reached by March 8. Booth-level Magalir Padai members upload daily progress reports to the Makkaludan Stalin app to track outreach.\nTamil Nadu\n/\nTamil Nadu Assembly Elections 2026\n/\nDravida Munnetra Kazhagam",

He could not recover from the injuries sustained then.\nValte’s body was flown from Delhi to Aizawl in neighbouring Mizoram, at the request of the family.  It was brought to his residence at Churachandpur in Manipur on February 24 via road from the Lengpui airport in Aizawl. As the convoy passed, people paid tributes along the way.\nChief Minister Yumnam Khemchand Singh is learnt to have told the family that arrangements would be made to the accord State honours to Valte.\nHowever, Valte’s son, Joseph, told The Hindu said the family members had handed over a list of demands to Governor Ajay Kumar Bhalla, and that the burial will not take place till they are fulfilled.\nA total shutdown was observed in Churachandpur district on Tuesday. The State government had declared official mourning from February 22 to 24.\nVumsuan Naulak, chairman, Zomi Council, said a postmortem was done at a Churachandpur hospital on Wednesday. The community leaders will convene a meeting to decide the future course of action. “We have a list of demands and till the government accepts the condition, the burial is unlikely,” Mr. Naulak said.\nIn a post on X on Tuesday, the Lok Bhavan, Manipur, said the Governor visited Churachandpur district to pay tributes to Valte, laying a wreath and shawl in solemn remembrance. “The Governor met the bereaved family and conveyed his heartfelt condolences, praying for the eternal peace of the departed soul and strength for the family during this moment of profound grief,” it said\nManipur Security Adviser Kuldiep Singh also paid his respects by laying a wreath and shawl.\nA senior government official confirmed that Valte’s family had submitted a list of demands to the Governor. “The family was told that the creation of a district is an administrative decision that takes time and requires consensus of the elected government. It cannot happen in three or four days,” the official said.\nIn a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on September 13, 2025, Valte said he was brutally attacked by “Meitei militia (Arambai Tenggol)”, resulting in severe injuries that paralysed him. Despite the gravity of the incident, no special inquiry, either by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) or the National Investigation Agency (NIA) was initiated, he said.\nThe three-term MLA from Thanlon constituency was attacked when he was returning from the Chief Minister’s Office after attending a security review meeting.

File photo: Special Arrangement\nThe Defence Ministry has issued a Request for Information (RFI) to procure long-range business jets for senior defence dignitaries and chiefs of the armed forces.\nA senior Ministry official said the government plans to replace the existing fleet of business jets with the Indian Air Force (IAF) that has been in service for 20 years. The replacement is planned in a phased manner and is expected to take time.\nThe decision to get a new fleet comes in the backdrop of the crash of a VSR Ventures-owned aircraft on January 28 that claimed the lives of Ajit Pawar, Maharashtra’s Deputy Chief Minister, and four others.\nSources said the RFI sought inputs from Indian and foreign vendors for the jets along with associated equipment for the IAF. The first part of the RFI outlines the broad operational characteristics and key technical parameters the aircraft must meet. The second part specifies the methodology for vendor response submission, including compliance requirements and prescribed formats.\nThe government will assess options in domestic and global markets before proceeding with the acquisition.\nOn September 21, 2005, four Embraer Legacy 600 business jets were inducted into the Air Headquarters Communication Squadron of the IAF, with three aircraft delivered initially and the fourth arriving a few months later. The aircraft were named Meghdoot, Vayudoot, Nabhdoot, and Gagandoot, and have since been used for VIP and communication duties.\nThe existing Embraer fleet requires a take-off distance of 1,800 metres and a landing distance of 1,400 metres, allowing operations from most airfields in India and abroad.

Closure of standalone schools will lead to a 500% increase in fees as this grants unfair monopoly to large K-12 institutions,” it added.\nAs shared by KCPS, the new regulations mandate a 30-year lease requirement even for standalone pre-schools at residential premises, which is impossible to comply with. “No landlord in the private market will ever fulfil, making it legally impossible for 90% of the schools to operate. Even the requirement of classroom sizes of 18 ft/20 ft (360 sq. ft) ignores the homely, secure environment and is physically impossible in residential neighbourhoods,” it stated.\n* Constitute a high-level committee immediately to simplify and redraft the rules specifically for Standalone Pre-schools (ECCE), distinct from K-12 industrial norms.\n* Halt all Harassment: Issue an immediate stay on the current impossible building, lease, and land conversion mandates until a fair framework is established.\n* Ensure Digital Transparency: Restore immediate public access to a functional and transparent registration portal.",

MOHAN\nProtests by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and its affiliate groups erupted across the State after Health Minister Veena George sustained injuries to her neck and hand during a scuffle between black-flag-wielding  Kerala Students Union (KSU) activists and the police at the Kannur railway station on Wednesday.\nThe Minister, who was scheduled to leave for Thiruvananthapuram, was admitted to the  Intensive Care Unit of the Kannur District Hospital. A medical bulletin from the hospital stated that an expert team had been assigned to assess the severity of the Minister’s neck injury.\nThe police arrested five KSU workers in connection with the incident and charged them with attempted murder.\nThe episode occurred amid widespread protests against the Minister by the Opposition in recent days, who have alleged a collapse of the public health sector. It sparked strong reactions and protest marches by Leftist and Left-leaning outfits across the State, leading to effigy-burning and confrontations with Congress workers.\nChief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan visited Ms. George at the hospital and described the incident as “a heinous attack” on a woman holding public office. “The incident reflects the inherent villainy of the Congress leadership. The Congress unleashed a band of assailants against the Minister. It has violated all norms of democratic protest and resorted to mob violence,” he said.\nMr. Vijayan stated that Kerala’s public health system was renowned and had emerged as the best in the country, according to surveys and audits by various national and international agencies, including the NITI Aayog.\nThe CPI(M) State secretariat condemned the alleged attack, accusing the Congress of attempting to harm her, citing the recent incident in which protesters placed a funeral wreath at her official residence in Thiruvananthapuram.\nParty general secretary M.A. Baby urged the Congress and the United Democratic Front (UDF) leadership to denounce the attack. CPI(M) State secretary M.V. Govindan squarely blamed Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan for the incident. Left Democratic Front convener T.P. Ramakrishnan called on the UDF to end such “farcical protests” against Kerala’s robust public health system.  Communist Party of India State secretary Binoy Viswom described the incident as an affront to democratic culture.\nMr. Satheesan, however, told reporters in Ernakulam that there was no evidence —  much less any video footage — showing KSU workers attacking Ms. George. He said the UDF would continue its black-flag protests against her.\nMr. Satheesan noted that the KSU protesters numbered only “four or five,” while an estimated 35 police personnel were protecting Ms. George. “No KSU worker came anywhere near her. In fact, Ms. George was seen charging towards the workers,” he said. He added that the Congress had conducted a preliminary inquiry and found no wrongdoing on the part of the workers. “If any inculpatory evidence emerges, the party will take action against them,” he stated.\nFormer Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president K. Sudhakaran, MP, mocked Ms. George, calling her “a good actor, though not a good health minister” and accusing her of feigning the attack. He dismissed it as a baseless political drama. “Eyewitness accounts and available footage clearly indicate that no physical attack was carried out on the Minister,” he maintained.",

She said patients and caregivers told them the doctor would not attend without payment. Desperate, she visited the doctor’s private clinic in Thrissur and paid ₹1,500, after which he examined Sanoop the next day.\nSanoop had initially sought treatment for knee pain in July 2023 at the medical college hospital. The family alleges that an injection led to a severe infection that spread across his body and ultimately caused total vision loss.\nThe case has sparked political attention, with Congress leader Anil Akkara visiting the family at their Thrikkur home and assuring full support. As an immediate measure, he announced that AI-enabled smart glasses, costing around ₹40,000 and requiring specialised training, would be provided to help Sanoop navigate by detecting objects in real time.\nMeanwhile, Congress workers staged a sit-in before the medical college superintendent’s office demanding strict action against the doctors responsible for the incident and dismissal of the doctor accused of accepting bribes. The party has also sought immediate compensation and sustained financial assistance for Sanoop’s treatment and livelihood.\nIn addition, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) secretary and Hospital Development Committee member Rajendran Arangath has filed a complaint before the Kerala State Human Rights Commission seeking urgent compensation and action against those allegedly responsible for the medical negligence.",

At the time, the amount was considered substantial and was reportedly provided to support wartime administration in the princely state of Bhopal.\nNow, more than a century later, Seth Jummalal’s grandson, Vivek Ruthia, said he is preparing to send a legal notice to the British government to recover the loan which was never repaid. He said that the documentary evidence of the transaction was recently discovered among old family records following his father’s death.\nThe document, dated June 4, 1917, stated that Seth Jumma Lal, of the firm Seth Rama Kishan Jaskaran Ruthia, “subscribed Rs 35,000 to the Indian War Loan and thereby showed his loyalty to the Government and Empire.\" It beares the signature of W S Davis, who was then the political agent in Bhopal.\nWar loans during that period were debt instruments issued by the British government to raise funds for military expenses during World War I, typically offering 5.5% interest.\nSeth Jummalal Ruthia died in 1937, nearly 20 years after the loan was extended. The matter, the family claimed, remained unsettled and gradually slipped into obscurity until now.\nRuthia said that he is consulting lawyers to explore whether a claim can be made against the current UK government.\n“It’s not just about money, it’s about justice and history,\" he said, adding that when adjusted for compound interest, inflation or gold prices, the original Rs 35,000 could now be worth several crores of rupees.\nThe Ruthia family was once among the most prominent and affluent in Sehore and the Bhopal princely state, with significant landholdings and business interests. Seth Jumma Lal Ruthia was a prominent trader in cloth and grain in Sehore during British rule. At the time of World War I, when the colonial administration was facing financial strain, local officials reportedly approached him for assistance.\nThey family continues to own property in Sehore, Indore and Bhopal.\nLegal experts note that claims involving pre-Independence transactions between colonial authorities and private individuals are rare and legally complex. While no legal notice has yet been sent, the family said that it is determined to pursue the matter.\nLatest Blogs",

Four exercises running in parallel, across mountains, forests, open skies, and open waters.\nThe 16th edition of Exercise “Vajra Prahar\" kicked off on February 24 at the Special Forces Training School in Bakloh, Himachal Pradesh. India has put 45 Special Forces personnel on the ground, soldiers trained for high-altitude infiltration through HALO and HAHO jumps, covert reconnaissance, and counter-terrorism operations in terrain that defeats most conventional units. 12 soldiers from the US Army’s Green Berets, specifically one full Operational Detachment Alpha, or ODA are participating in Exercise Vajra Prahar.\nAn ODA is the core unit of Green Beret operations, with each soldier holding a specialist role in weapons, medicine, communications, or engineering. The exercise focuses on joint mission planning, tactical drills, and building the kind of trust that makes two different armies function as one.\nAlongside “Vajra Prahar\", Exercise Dharma Guardian 2026 is underway at the Foreign Training Node in Chaubattia, Uttarakhand. The 7th edition of India’s joint military exercise with Japan will continue till March 9.\nIndian Army troops and soldiers from the Japanese Ground Self-Defence Force are working through counter-insurgency and jungle warfare drills, reinforcing a defence relationship that has been picking up real momentum in recent years.\nDown south, Exercise “Kalari Leap\" was being held across the Lakshadweep and Minicoy archipelago, with landings at Agatti airport. This was a high-tempo joint maritime exercise involving the Indian Air Force’s Southern Air Command, the Armed Forces Special Operations Division, and the Indian Coast Guard.

        "title": "'Corruption In Judiciary' Chapter: NCERT Apologises, Retracts Class 8 Social Science Textbook",
        "content": "The NCERT on Wednesday issued an official apology and said it will retract the new social science textbook for Class 8, which mentioned a chapter on “corruption in judiciary\".\nThe chapter attracted sharp criticism from the Supreme Court, following which the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) said it has put the textbook’s distribution on hold.\nAccording to a press release, the NCERT will be rewriting the curriculum of the textbook in question – Exploring Society: India and Beyond, Vol II, which was officially released on February 24. Within hours of its release, the book was taken off the council’s website and all physical circulation was stopped after the SC expressed its “ire\" over the content, which it deemed defamatory and an affront to the integrity of the legal system.\nA three-judge bench, comprising Chief Justice of India Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi, took suo motu cognisance of the “objectionable\" statements regarding the judiciary. The matter was brought to the court’s attention for urgent consideration by senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Abhishek Singhvi.\nDuring the proceedings, CJI Surya Kant issued a stern warning stating that “nobody on earth will be allowed to defame the judiciary and taint its integrity\".\nIn a swift response, the NCERT released a statement acknowledging that “certain inappropriate textual material and error of judgement have inadvertently crept into\" Chapter 4, titled ‘The Role of Judiciary in our Society’.\nIt said the inclusion of such material was “purely unintentional\" and expressed deep regret for the oversight. The ministry of education, through the department of school education and literacy, intervened in the matter and ordered the distribution of the textbook to be on “strict hold\" until further notice.\nThe NCERT further said it holds the judiciary in the “highest esteem\", viewing the institution as the “upholder of the Indian Constitution and protector of Fundamental Rights\". It said the primary objective of its new textbooks is to “strengthen constitutional literacy, institutional respect, and informed understanding of democratic participation amongst students\", rather than questioning the authority of constitutional bodies.\nThe controversial chapter had listed corruption, along with a massive backlog of cases and an inadequate number of judges, as significant challenges currently facing the Indian judicial system.\nTo rectify the situation, the NCERT has announced that the curriculum will be completely rewritten. This process will involve close consultation with “appropriate authorities\" to ensure the material is accurate and respectful of the country’s institutions.\nThe revised version of the textbook is expected to be made available to Class 8 students in time for the commencement of the 2026-27 academic session.\nThe textbook noted that judges are bound by a code of conduct and that mechanisms exist to address complaints, including the Centralised Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System, which received over 1,600 complaints between 2017 and 2021.\nIt also explained that Parliament has the authority to impeach judges after due inquiry in cases of serious misconduct. The book stated that corruption experienced at various levels of the judiciary could affect access to justice, particularly for disadvantaged sections and highlighted efforts to improve transparency.\nThe previous Class 8 textbook published by NCERT explained the structure, role and independence of the judiciary but did not mention corruption as a challenge.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "Tension briefly gripped a village in Bihar’s Bhojpur district after allegations of forced religious conversion surfaced, prompting police intervention and an official inquiry that has so far found no evidence to support the claims.\nThe incident occurred on Monday, February 23, in Chatar village under the Barhara police station area, where residents of Pakdiya Tola and Bind Toli accused a man, locally known as ‘Pani Wale Baba’, of encouraging villagers to change their religion under the guise of healing rituals involving water.\nAccording to villagers, the man was allegedly distributing religious literature said to have been brought from Nepal and speaking about religious conversion. As word spread, anger grew among local residents, who alleged that members of the Mahadalit community were being misled in the name of treatment and miracles. Some local activist groups were also informed, leading to a gathering of people and a brief period of unrest in the area.\nHowever, several women present at the site rejected the allegations, stating that the man had only been treating people with water-based rituals and had not promoted any religious conversion.\nFollowing information about the incident, a team from Barhara police station reached the village and began questioning residents. The man is reportedly a native of Muzaffarpur and is believed to be associated with Christianity. When police attempted to take him for questioning, some women allegedly protested and pushed the personnel, allowing the man to leave. The situation remained tense for some time, forcing the police team to withdraw.\nHowever, acting on the instructions of the SP, SDPO (Sadar-2) Ranjit Kumar Singh visited the village, interacted with residents and conducted an enquiry. Singh said no concrete evidence of religious conversion had been found so far. According to Singh, the man had visited the village for treatment purposes and several women recorded statements in his support.\nUnder existing laws, forced or induced religious conversion is a punishable offence, and police action can be initiated only after proper investigation. Officials said that no confirmed case of religious conversion has been registered at Barhara police station so far.\nThe incident continues to be discussed among villagers, with some describing it as a rumour while others have demanded a thorough probe. Police have appealed to residents to maintain peace and avoid drawing conclusions before the investigation is completed.\nLatest Blogs",

The severed limb was placed in a sealed envelope and stored in a designated room.\nThe hospital administration had granted permission to an authorised organisation to collect and transfer the amputated limb. However, no representative from the organisation arrived to take custody of it. As a result, the limb remained stored in the hospital premises.\nOn February 22, hospital staff were removing trolleys from the storage room.

        "title": "Feeling Sidelined, 24 Karnataka Congress MLCs Write To Mallikarjun Kharge Seeking Cabinet Berths",
        "content": "Amid power-sharing tensions and speculation over a Cabinet reshuffle, 24 Members of the Legislative Council (MLCs) from the Karnataka Congress have sought representation in the state Cabinet.\nThe MLCs submitted a memorandum to AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge, urging that Council members be given adequate space in the ministry. The signatories had reportedly travelled to Delhi in December to press their case before the party high command.\nThe move comes as discussions continue over Cabinet reconstitution and internal balancing within the government.\nIn their memorandum, the MLCs said the absence of Council members in the Cabinet has created a sense of inequality and demoralisation. They argued that continued exclusion could create a perception that MLCs have limited political prospects, which may weaken the party’s organisational structure over time.\nThey also warned of a ripple effect. Capable leaders may prefer to seek Assembly tickets instead of contesting Council elections, which could fuel factionalism and erode grassroots strength.\nThe signatories said the Karnataka Legislative Council, established in 1907, is among the oldest in the country. They pointed out that MLCs represent large regions, often covering 10 to 15 Assembly constituencies, and that members elected from local bodies maintain direct engagement with grassroots institutions.\nThey stated that, compared to MLAs, MLCs often influence a broader cross-section of voters and play a key role in strengthening the party’s organisational network. They also noted that Graduates’ and Teachers’ constituency MLCs represent 15 to 20 Assembly segments and regularly engage with opinion leaders such as educators and graduates.\nAccording to the memorandum, these members help mobilise youth and intellectual support for the Congress, while teachers, as respected community influencers, shape public perception in favour of the party.\nThe MLCs have urged the high command to induct at least five Council members in the next Cabinet reshuffle. They suggested balanced representation, including one member from local bodies, one from Graduates’ or Teachers’ constituencies, and one from nominated or other categories.\nThey said meaningful Cabinet representation is essential to ensure organisational cohesion and balanced political representation within the government.\nLatest Blogs",

It seems to be a calculated measure.\"\nThe CJI further took a suo motu cognisance of the issue and said he had been receiving numerous calls and messages, including from High Court judges, expressing concern.\nCJI Kant’s statement came after Senior Advocates Kapil Sibal and Abhishesh Singhvi mentioned the matter before him.\nSenior advocate Kapil Sibal told the court that the inclusion of “judicial corruption\" in school textbooks is “very disturbing\". Adding to this, Abhishek Singhvi argued that it appeared as though one institution was being singled out, with no mention of corruption among politicians, ministers or bureaucrats.\n“We are deeply disturbed as the members of this institution to find that the children of Class 8 students are being taught about corruption in the judiciary. It is part of the NCERT. It is entirely scandalous. We have the copies of the book,\" Sibal said in court.\nResponding to the concerns, the CJI asserted that he is aware of the matter and will take action. He added that the court would not permit any attack on the judicial institution.\n“Wait for a day. This is definitely concerning the entire institution. The bar and the bench are perturbed. Every stakeholder in the system is really perturbed, I am receiving lot of calls and messages.

However, it is also reported that the fighter jets are likely to miss the event as the IAF is conducting safety checks on its Tejas fleet.\nThe development came after Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) on Monday said that the LCA Mk-1 was recently involved in a technical incident on the ground. The company’s response came in regards to the clarification followed after media reports claimed that a jet had crashed at a frontline airbase.\n“There has been no reported crash of the LCA Tejas. The event in question was a minor technical incident on the ground,\" the statement said.\nAn IAF pilot was killed last November after an LCA Mk-1 crashed during a demonstration flight at the Dubai airshow. That was the second crash involving the India-built single-engine fighter jet.\nEarlier, a Tejas fighter jet had crashed near Jaisalmer in Rajasthan in March 2024, minutes after participating in a tri-services exercise that sought to demonstrate India’s growing efforts towards self-reliance in the defence manufacturing sector. The pilot ejected safely at the time.\nLatest Blogs",

With this, the total supplementary expenditure for the financial year 2025-26 has reached Rs 1.45 lakh crore.

He spoke about La Paz’s growing engagement with India, the promise of South-South cooperation in emerging technologies, and how partnerships in AI can help build domestic capacity rather than deepen global inequalities.\nExcerpts from the interview:\nMinister, Bolivia has traditionally focused on extractive industries and basic technology sectors. How does participation in the India AI Impact Summit fit into Bolivia’s broader science and technology strategy?\nBolivia’s participation in the India AI Impact Summit reflects our broader policy of steadily strengthening science, technology, and innovation as key drivers of sustainable development. We are committed to transforming our productive sectors by adopting emerging technologies, diversifying the economy, and creating greater value.\nIndia is a strategic partner from the Global South, with a strong track record in digital innovation and inclusive technological solutions. Our presence here shows Bolivia’s intent to learn from successful models, encourage knowledge exchange, and build partnerships that ultimately improve the lives of our people.\nArtificial intelligence can deepen global inequalities if mismanaged. How is Bolivia ensuring that Al collaborations with India will build domestic capacity rather than create dependency?\nBolivia views international cooperation as a partnership built on mutual respect, complementarity, and joint capacity-building. In the field of AI, our focus is on developing human talent, ensuring technology transfer, and strengthening institutions.\nThe goal is to create solutions tailored to Bolivia’s own realities, while promoting technological sovereignty and responsible data governance. Our cooperation with India is designed to build domestic capacity, not dependency, so that the benefits of AI support inclusive and sustainable development.\nAdvanced AI relies heavily on high-performance chips and semiconductors. Does Bolivia plan to collaborate with India on developing or accessing AI hardware?\nWe recognise the strategic importance of technological infrastructure for advancing AI. Bolivia is open to exploring cooperation mechanisms that improve access to advanced computing capabilities, encourage technical knowledge-sharing, and enable participation in initiatives linked to specialised AI hardware.\nFrom a complementary partnership perspective, we see opportunities to deepen dialogue in areas of shared interest, including technology innovation connected to strategic resources and the strengthening of technical capabilities in emerging sectors.\nFinally, during your visit to India and interactions with Indian counterparts, what were your key takeaways?\nThe visit highlighted the remarkable dynamism of India’s technology ecosystem and its strong commitment to using innovation as a tool for inclusion and development. It also reinforced the value of South-South cooperation as an effective way to tackle shared challenges.\nWe especially appreciated the openness and willingness of our Indian counterparts to expand collaboration in areas such as applied AI, digital transformation of public services, and institutional strengthening. We leave with a strong sense that this relationship can grow into a long-term strategic partnership built on trust, respect, and mutual benefit.\nLatest Blogs",

It is one party acting against the interests of the country simply because it is not in power,\" he said, accusing the Congress of having no clear roadmap, policy direction or positive agenda for the youth.\nThe BJP’s response came after Gandhi defended the protest during a public address in Bhopal, where he praised Youth Congress members as “fearless lions\" and described them as carrying the “blood of patriotism\".\nHis remarks were aimed at countering criticism over the disruption that took place at Bharat Mandapam on February 20, when the AI impact summit was underway.\nMeanwhile, Delhi Police have arrested Indian Youth Congress (IYC) national president Uday Bhanu Chib in connection with the incident. Police sources said Chib was questioned before being formally taken into custody, taking the total number of arrests in the case to eight.\nOn Monday, three other IYC members, Jitendra Yadav, Raja Gujar and Vimal Ajay Kumar, were also arrested, while four others had been detained earlier.\nAccording to police, the incident occurred around 12.30 pm inside a hall hosting the AI Impact Expo.\nThe protesters had completed online registration and entered the venue using QR codes.\nOnce inside, they allegedly removed their outer clothing, staged a shirtless protest, raised slogans and displayed politically charged messages on their T-shirts, including slogans targeting the Prime Minister.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "More than 93,000 adult women were reported missing in Maharashtra over the last two years, the Devendra Fadnavis-led government informed the Assembly in a written reply. The data has once again brought focus on the scale of the issue and the challenge before law enforcement agencies.\nIn 2024, a total of 45,662 adult women were reported missing across the state. Out of them, 30,877 were traced. In the same year, 11,316 minor girls were reported missing, and 8,475 were found. The numbers increased in 2025. According to the government, 48,278 women were reported missing during the year. Of these, 36,581 were traced. In the case of minor girls, 12,113 went missing, and 10,295 were found.\nWhile police have managed to trace a large number of missing persons, thousands remain unaccounted for each year. The figures show both the scale of the problem and the continued efforts to address it.\nTo tackle the issue, the government has been running Operation Muskaan since July 2015. The special drive focuses on tracing missing children and reuniting them with their families. Till 2024, 13 phases of Operation Muskaan were conducted across the state.\nThe 14th phase is currently underway in early 2026. As per the data shared in the Assembly, between the launch of this phase and February 16, 2026, police have traced 454 boys and 947 girls. The government also provided figures for teenagers between the ages of 15 and 18. Between 2024 and 2025, 4,989 boys and girls in this age group were reported missing. Out of them, 4,813 were traced.\nOfficials maintain that police teams are actively working on missing cases, using local intelligence, digital tracking and coordination between districts. Special focus is given to cases involving minors.\nThe data highlights a serious social concern. While many families are reunited with their loved ones, the steady rise in missing cases shows the need for stronger preventive measures, awareness, and faster response systems.\nLatest Blogs",

He told her that he will eat at home and is expected to land in Delhi at 9pm. She kept waiting till 11pm for Vikas to come. It was only then that we found out about the crash,\" he said.\nOperated by Delhi-based Redbird Airways Pvt Ltd, the Beechcraft C90 aircraft VT-AJV took off from Ranchi at 7.11pm with a patient on board. After take-off, the plane made contact with Kolkata but around 7.34pm, it lost communications and RADAR contact.\nSP Sumit Kumar, speaking to ANI, said: “We got information around 10pm that an accident has happened… Getting here was difficult considering the terrain… The Delhi team will come here for investigation and try to recover the black box… Total number of deaths is seven.\"\nHeart-wrenching stories have come to the fore from the crash. For instance, the family of Shaw, the patient being transported in the ambulance, had taken a loan of around Rs 8 lakh to hire the aircraft that crashed shortly after taking off.\nShaw had suffered 65 per cent burns last Monday after an electric short circuit at his restaurant in Chandwa triggered a fire. As his condition deteriorated, the family decided to shift him to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in New Delhi for advanced care. As a journey by road was not possible for Shaw, the family had borrowed around Rs 8 lakh from friends and relatives for an air ambulance.\n“Our home has been destroyed. Not just one home, many families have been ruined. If proper treatment had been available in Ranchi itself, we would not have had to take him to Delhi. And in the process of taking him to Delhi, this tragedy happened, our very existence has been shattered,\" Shaw’s relatives said.\nAnother life lost in the crash was of Vikas Kumar Gupta, the doctor on board the aircraft. Speaking to the media, Gupta’s father spoke about the sacrifices he made to educate his son.\n“My elder son was posted in Sadar Hospital, Ranchi. If there had been proper health facilities here, why would they have gone to Delhi for treatment? I had sold my farmland and other things for his education,\" he told ANI.\nThe Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) condoled the incident and launched a probe into the crash. A team from the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) also visited the site to recover the black box and find the exact cause behind the crash.\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "Govt Set To Roll Out Nationwide Free HPV Vaccination For Girls Aged 14-15 Years | Exclusive",
        "content": "The Union government is preparing to roll out a nationwide Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination campaign within a week, aimed at reducing the burden of cervical cancer among young women in India, government sources familiar with the development have told News18.\nThe campaign will provide MSD’s Gardasil 4 HPV vaccine free of cost to eligible beneficiaries through government health facilities across the country. In the private market, the vaccine costs around Rs 4,000 per dose.\nGardasil 4 protects against four HPV strains—6, 11, 16 and 18. “Of these, strains 16 and 18 are considered high-risk and are responsible for nearly 83 per cent of cervical cancer cases in India. Globally, these strains are responsible for over 70 per cent of cases,\" a senior official familiar with the development said, while explaining why the Centre has chosen Gardasil vaccine. “This initiative represents a decisive step towards eliminating cervical cancer, one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among women in the country.\"\nUnder the proposed rollout plan, a single-dose schedule will be followed. “WHO’s SAGE panel as well as India’s top panels on vaccination have approved the single-dose usage of Gardasil considering it to be equally effective to double or multi-dose vaccine.\"\nCervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women in India, with over 78,000 new cases and 42,000 deaths reported in 2024. The campaign will run in campaign mode for 90 days, followed by integration into routine immunisation days.\nWho Is Eligible And Where To Go?\nThe vaccination process will be integrated with the U-WIN digital platform, similar to the CoWIN system used during the Covid-19 vaccination drive. From slot booking to certification, the entire process is likely to be digitised.\nThe campaign will primarily target girls in the 14 to 15 age group. “Those who have just turned 14 will remain eligible until they turn 15. In addition, girls who turn 15 at the time of launch will be allowed a three-month window to receive the vaccine. The vaccine will be available free of cost only within this eligibility bracket,\" the source quoted above said.\n“The campaign will target 14-year-old girls across India, covering an annual cohort of approximately 1.15 crore girls each year. Vaccination will be provided free of cost, voluntary, and administered only with parental consent,\" he said.\nVaccinations will be administered at all government health facilities, including Ayushman Mandirs, government medical colleges, district hospitals, primary and community health centres. Each vaccination team will include a vaccinator, mobiliser, verifier, and volunteer.\nAll sessions will be linked to 24×7 health facilities for AEFI (Adverse Events Following Immunization) management, with helplines available for parental queries. “Health workers across 36 states and Union Territories have been trained for the rollout, with doctors and trained healthcare staff overseeing implementation.\"\nWho Is Supplying The Vaccine & How Safe Is It?\nOn the supply front, Gavi has committed to providing 2.6 crore doses of Gardasil between 2025 and 2027. Of these, around 1.5 crore doses have already reached India. The government officials estimate that India requires approximately 1.15 crore doses annually to cover girls turning 14 each year.\n“Since the introduction of Gardasil in 2006, over 50 crore doses have been administered worldwide, with no serious safety concerns reported except rare cases of anaphylaxis,\" the official quoted above said.\nThe vaccine is non-live, recombinant, and cannot cause HPV infection.\n“HPV vaccines are 93-100 per cent effective in preventing cervical cancer. Global studies, including trials in Kenya and Costa Rica, confirm that a single-dose schedule provides protection comparable to two or three doses, with efficacy sustained for over a decade,\" the official explained.\nHPV Campaign On PM Modi’s Radar\nThe government’s intent to expand access to HPV vaccination had earlier been articulated at the highest level. In an interaction with philanthropist Bill Gates, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said: “In the coming days, I want to talk about cervical cancer, especially for our daughters. I want to give a budget to our scientists in India… and with very little money, I want to vaccinate all the daughters in my country so that they are protected from cancer. I am working in that direction these days.\"\nThe broader policy push was also highlighted by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman during her Interim Budget 2024–25 speech, where she stated, “Our government will encourage vaccination for girls in the age group of 9 to 14 years to prevent cervical cancer.\"\nThe upcoming rollout, if implemented as planned, would mark one of the largest adolescent vaccination drives focused specifically on cancer prevention in the country.\nLatest Blogs",

In a written reply, the government placed detailed figures on record, showing the scale of enforcement over the past five years.\nIn 2025 alone, 2,438 offences related to gutkha were registered across Maharashtra. Police arrested 3,173 accused in these cases. Authorities also seized gutkha worth Rs 239.10 crore during the year. Preventive action was taken in 1,906 cases.\nIn 2021, police registered 2,617 offences. As many as 3,934 accused were arrested, and preventive action was taken in 1,550 cases. In 2022, 2,367 offences were registered. Police arrested 3,332 accused and carried out 1,397 preventive actions. The highest number of cases in the five-year period was recorded in 2023. That year, 3,477 offences were registered and 4,384 accused were arrested. Preventive action was taken in 2,399 cases. In 2024, 2,764 offences were registered. Police arrested 3,668 accused and initiated 2,044 preventive actions.\nTaken together, more than 13,600 offences have been registered between 2021 and 2025. Over 18,000 accused have been arrested during this period. The steady number of cases each year shows that enforcement agencies are active, but it also indicates that the illegal trade continues to find new routes and methods.\nThe government also shared details of recent action. On January 2, 2026, Bhiwandi City Police registered a case related to illegal gutkha activities and arrested three accused. In Vasai-Virar, five offences were registered in 2025. Six people were arrested and gutkha worth Rs 3.84 lakh was seized in those cases.\nGutkha remains banned in Maharashtra under food safety laws because of its serious health risks, including cancer and other oral diseases. Despite the ban, demand for the product has not fully disappeared. This keeps enforcement agencies on constant alert.\nThe government said police and food safety officials are conducting regular raids and checks across districts. Officials maintain that strict action will continue to curb the circulation of banned tobacco products and break supply networks operating within the state.\nLatest Blogs",

In addition, he expects each minister to share some “good news\" during the meeting — either related to their ministry’s performance or from their personal lives.\nAccording to sources, ministers often highlight notable achievements of their departments as part of this informal segment. These may include major policy outcomes, administrative successes, or initiatives that have positively impacted citizens. On some occasions, inspiring accounts are shared to motivate fellow Cabinet members. In one such instance, a senior minister reportedly spoke about reviving a loss-making public sector undertaking within months and steering it towards a profit of Rs 100 crore.\nPersonal milestones have also found mention during these interactions. Last year, Civil Aviation Minister Kinjarapu Rammohan Naidu informed the Prime Minister and Cabinet colleagues that he had been blessed with a baby boy. The whole team burst into laughter and congratulations for the real “good news\".\nOn another occasion, Union Minister CR Patil told the Cabinet about the action taken by his ministry to correct the flaws of Jal Jeevan Mission which was lauded by all.\nMinisters from key portfolios such as power, water resources, roads and highways, health, railways, education, and information technology frequently share updates on decisions that have brought tangible improvements in the lives of ordinary citizens.\nSources indicate that the Prime Minister’s initiative is aimed at fostering a culture of positive reinforcement within the Cabinet, encouraging ministers to focus on citizen-centric outcomes and set new benchmarks in governance. Typically, this “good news\" exchange takes place during the informal segment of the meeting, after the formal agenda has been concluded.\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "India's First Prime Minister Wasn't Jawaharlal Nehru, Here's What Happened In 1915",
        "content": "Long before the midnight tryst with destiny in 1947, when Jawaharlal Nehru took oath as independent India’s first Prime Minister, a bold but largely forgotten experiment in self-rule had already been attempted far from home.\nIn the middle of the First World War, on December 1, 1915, a group of Indian revolutionaries proclaimed the formation of the Provisional Government of India in Kabul, staking a claim to complete independence decades before it was realised.\nAt the height of World War I, with the British Empire deeply engaged on multiple fronts, revolutionaries sought to internationalise their struggle. In Kabul, they announced what they described as the first “Provisional Government of India\" (Hukumat-e-Mukhtara-e-Hind), an exile administration aimed at rallying global support against British rule.\nThe government was led by two prominent figures. Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh was declared President, while Maulana Barkatullah, also known as Barkatullah Bhopali, became Prime Minister. Maulana Ubaidullah Sindhi, a noted scholar associated with Deoband, was appointed Home Minister.\nRaja Mahendra Pratap had travelled widely to secure support for India’s cause and met Germany’s Kaiser Wilhelm II during the war. With German backing, he reached Afghanistan, then seen as a strategic gateway to India’s northwest frontier. Kabul offered both symbolic and geopolitical significance, a base outside direct British control, yet close enough to signal intent.\nMaulana Barkatullah, a scholar and seasoned political activist, had earlier campaigned for India’s freedom in countries including the United States and Japan. In Kabul, he worked to articulate the government’s position to foreign powers and mobilise diplomatic recognition. The administration reportedly received assurances of support from countries aligned against Britain, including Germany and the Ottoman Empire. There were even discussions about issuing independent Indian passports and postage stamps, powerful symbols of sovereignty.\nHistorians note that the Kabul government’s objective was clear: to demonstrate that Indians were prepared to govern themselves and to seek international backing for an armed uprising against the British, leveraging the global conflict. Letters were sent to rulers and heads of state across Asia and Europe, urging them to support India’s liberation.\nAlthough the experiment was short-lived, the end of World War I and shifting diplomatic alignments undercut its prospects; it marked one of the earliest organised attempts to establish an alternative Indian state structure in exile. Raja Mahendra Pratap was later nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, and Barkatullah continued advocating for India’s independence abroad until his death.\nIn Bhopal, Barkatullah University stands as a tribute to the revolutionary scholar. In 2013, the Government of India also issued a commemorative postage stamp in his honour.\nParallel to the Kabul initiative was a covert operation that came to be known as the Silk Handkerchief Movement, or the Silk Letter Conspiracy. After the formation of the provisional government, Maulana Ubaidullah Sindhi devised a secret method of communication between Indian revolutionaries and foreign allies such as Turkey.\nMessages were written in Persian on pieces of yellow silk cloth rather than paper, making them easier to conceal and more durable. These silk letters were stitched into garments or carried discreetly across borders by trusted couriers. The plan aimed to coordinate a broader armed revolt within India with assistance from powers hostile to Britain.\nHowever, in 1916, British intelligence intercepted some of these communications. Several leaders were arrested, and the conspiracy was effectively dismantled before it could translate into a full-scale uprising.\nDecades later, as constitutional reforms began reshaping British India, another lesser-known political milestone unfolded in the provinces. Under the Government of India Act, 1935, provincial elections were held in 1937. Although the Indian National Congress secured majorities in several provinces, including Bihar, it initially declined to form governments over concerns about the sweeping powers retained by colonial governors.\nIn Bihar, the Muslim Independent Party was invited to form the ministry. Muhammad Yunus became the province’s Premier, a title often referred to at the time as Prime Minister. He assumed office in April 1937 and served for 109 days until July 19 that year.\nBorn on May 4, 1884, in Panhara village near Patna, Muhammad Yunus came from a family of legal professionals. His father, Maulvi Ali Hasan Mukhtar, was a noted lawyer, and Yunus followed in his footsteps before entering politics.\nThese parallel stories, of an exile government in Kabul during a global war, a secret silk-letter network spanning continents, and a short-lived provincial premier in Bihar, underscore the diverse and international dimensions of India’s freedom struggle.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "In a significant move aimed at easing access to long-pending provident fund savings, the Ministry of Labour and Employment has decided to roll out a pilot exercise to refund money lying in inactive EPF accounts directly to beneficiaries.\nAs per Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) rules, any account that does not record a transaction for three consecutive years is classified as inoperative.\nAccording to available data, there are 31.86 lakh inoperative accounts, collectively holding Rs 10,903 crore. Of these, around 7.11 lakh accounts fall in the Rs 0–Rs 1,000 category, amounting to Rs 30.52 crore.\nUnder the pilot phase, funds worth approximately Rs 650 crore will be credited to nearly six lakh such inactive accounts. Government sources indicate that the transfers are expected to be completed within the next month, with the money being deposited directly into the bank accounts linked to these holdings.\nThe benefit will initially cover Aadhaar-linked accounts. For inactive accounts that are not yet linked to Aadhaar, the Ministry has directed its state offices to expedite the seeding process to enable seamless transfers.\nSources said the government observed that several accounts, even those holding small sums, have remained inactive as account holders were reluctant to initiate withdrawals due to cumbersome procedures. In many instances, individuals seeking to withdraw as little as Rs 1,000 were required to make multiple visits to EPF offices and complete extensive paperwork.
