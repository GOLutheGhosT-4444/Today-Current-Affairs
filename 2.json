        "content": "A file image of Bihar Assembly Speaker Prem Kuma.\n| Photo Credit: ANI\nSeveral petitions have been filed in Patna High Court challenging the elections of over 40 elected members of the State Assembly, including Speaker Prem Kumar, Energy and Finance Minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav and others. The court has issued notices to the respondent legislators.\nThe petitions have been filed by the candidates who lost the election from their respective constituencies, and the court, in the usual course, has issued notices to the elected representatives from both ruling and Opposition parties, but the majority among them belong to the ruling NDA alliance parties.\n“Usually, no election petition is dismissed by the court outright. Notices are issued to the respondents, and orders would be passed by the court after examining the material at hand”, said Siddharth Prasad, who represents the Election Commission in the court. The petitions, said to be over 40, have been filed by the candidates who have lost elections from their respective constituencies, said Mr. Prasad to media persons.\nThe petitions challenging the elections of newly elected MLAs, including the Speaker of the State Assembly and nine-term BJP MLA from Gaya town, Prem Kumar, senior Minister in Nitish Kumar's cabinet, Bijendra Prasad Yadav of JD-U, former Minister Jibesh Kumar Mishra of BJP, Chetan Anand (JD-U) and others. The petition against Prem Kumar has been filed by Akhauri Onkar Nath who had contested the election as Congress candidate and lost by 26, 423 votes.\nSimilarly, the court has issued notice to senior JD-U leader and nine-term MLA from Supaul, Bijendra Prasad Yadav, who is also the State’s Energy and Finance minister. Mr. Yadav had defeated Congress candidate Minnatullah Rahmani by over 30,000 votes.\nThe BJP candidate from Jale constituency in Darbhanga district and former Minister in Nitish Kumar's cabinet, Jibesh Mishra, too had defeated Congress candidate Rishi Mishra by over 20,000 votes. But, the ruling JD-U candidate from Nabinagar constituency of Aurangabad district, Chetan Anand, had won the poll by just 112 votes, defeating the Opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal candidate Amod Kumar Singh.\nMost of the election petitions have been filed in the court citing alleged discrepancies in affidavits filed by the winning candidates concerned or, for violation of other provisions of the Representation of the People Act, said the EC counsel Siddharth Prasad. The petitions have also been challenged against RJD MLA from Goh constituency of Aurangabad, Amarendra Kumar and others too. The court has directed the MLAs to respond within the stipulated timeframe for further proceedings to take place.\nHowever, some of Patna HC lawyers told The Hindu that “issuance of notices does not imply guilt but, yes, it marks that the court has found sufficient grounds to seek clarification from the respondents”. “Election petitions are a constitutional remedy available to candidates who wish to challenge results on grounds of discrepancies like procedural lapses, false declarations, corrupt practices etc.”, said senior advocate of the court, Amit Prakash.\nIn the 2025 two-phased State Assembly elections in Bihar, the NDA comprising the BJP, JD-U, Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), and Rashtriya Lok Morcha had won 202 seats out of a total of 243-member State Assembly, the Opposition mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) allies RJD had won 25, Congress 6, Left parties three seats and the rest are by others.\nBihar\n/\npolitics\n/\nstate politics",

        "content": "The Supreme Court on Thursday reserved for judgment a petition filed by AIADMK leader Saidai S Duraisamy against a Madras High Court verdict dismissing his case linking Tamil Nadu Chief Minister and DMK leader M K Stalin to ‘corrupt practices’ ahead of the 2011 Assembly election to the Kolathur constituency.\nA Bench of Justices J.K. Maheshwari and Vijay Bishnoi heard the submissions by the lawyers appearing for both parties.\nMr. Duraisamy had alleged that the DMK party used its functionaries and money power to lure voters in favour in innovative ways amounting to corrupt practice under Section 123 of the Representation of the People Act.\nMr. Stalin’s counsel, senior advocate Kapil Sibal, said the petitioner had no evidence, whatsoever, to show that the alleged corrupt practices, if any,were done with the express or deemed consent of the candidate. Mr. Sibal had argued that a mere “preponderance of probabilities” would not drive home a charge of corrupt practice like bribery of electors to vote in favour of a candidate under Section 123 of the 1951 Act.\nThe Madras High Court had dismissed the allegations raised by Mr. Duraisamy for lack of conclusive evidence in 2017. It had found that certain CDs brought forth by Mr. Duraisamy did not even comply with the “basic” requirement of a Section 65B certification. The provision mandates a certificate verifying the authenticity, integrity and source of a digital data before admitting it as evidence in court.\nMr. Duraisamy had contended that the DMK party had used the “’Thirumangalam Formula”’ to provide money to the voters in a novel way through community feedings, courier service, currency in newspapers, Arathi Plate contributions and slips to purchase consumer items, etc. A goods vehicle had been caught with boxes of currency.\nHowever, the averments had not impressed the High Court, which came to the conclusion  that there was “no categorical averment that the 1st respondent (Mr. Stalin) had given his consent to his party functionaries to bribe the voters and self-help group members with a view to attract a misdeed of ‘corrupt practice’”.\n“In regard to the allegation of money distribution by the 1st Respondent’s [Stalin] party by adopting Thirumangalam Formula in a novel way of community feedings, courier service, currency in News paper, Arathi Plate contributions and slips to the voters to purchase consumer items etc, this court points out that there is no convincing, satisfactory and acceptable proof produced on the side of the petitioner,” the High Court had noted.",

MURALI KUMAR\nThe Karnataka State Travel Operators’ Association (KSTOA) has submitted a detailed memorandum to the State government ahead of the 2026–27 Budget, seeking road tax rationalisation, withdrawal of the additional 3% cess on commercial vehicles, and enhanced infrastructure support to boost the transport and tourism sectors.\nThe association submitted comprehensive suggestions as part of the pre-Budget consultation to the Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Transport Minister Ramalinga Reddy. The association said that the industry and transport sectors remain the economic lifeline of the State, providing employment to thousands despite economic slowdowns, fuel price fluctuations and natural calamities.\nCiting official data for 2025-26, the association noted that Karnataka has a population of around 6.8 crore, with 53.6 lakh income tax filers and over 10 lakh active GST registrations. “Nearly 44% of the State’s own tax revenue comes from GST, and over 3 crore vehicles are registered in Karnataka. More than 35 lakh workers are covered under ESI, with 3-4 lakh new EPF registrations added annually,” the letter stated.\nHowever, it flagged growing challenges faced by self-employed operators and entrepreneurs due to high road taxes, toll charges and rising operational costs. According to the association, some vehicle owners are opting to register their vehicles in other States to reduce tax burden. It urged the government to consider a rational reduction in road tax to prevent such migration and encourage registrations within Karnataka.\nTo help achieve the targets under the Tourism Policy 2024-29, the association sought tax exemptions or reductions for tourist vehicles, including mini buses, multi-utility vehicles. “Tax concessions and a hassle-free bilateral interstate agreement for private tourist vehicles would support seamless movement and revenue growth,”  KSTOA president K. Radhakrishna Holla said.\nHe also demanded reconsideration of the additional 3% cess imposed on yellow-board commercial vehicles in the 2025-26 Budget. He sought exemption for operators already contributing to ESI and PF for their employees.",

The posts also claimed that the strawberry-flavoured milk powder did not contain natural strawberries but artificial colours and preservatives, and questioned how the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) had granted approval for such products.\nThe complainant further alleged that the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF), a government-owned cooperative, was manufacturing and marketing such products for profit, and described them as unsafe for consumption.\nKMF, in a press release dated February 18 strongly refuted the allegations, terming them baseless and misleading. The federation clarified that it strictly adheres to all food safety standards and regulations prescribed by statutory authorities, including FSSAI, and assured consumers that Nandini milk and milk products are completely safe for consumption.\nKMF stated that the social media posts had caused unnecessary confusion among millions of consumers who have trusted the Nandini brand for decades.",

AI today is at a critical juncture and is in need of regulatory safeguards to build public trust.\nTelangana government is taking AI technology to the grassroots level with sustainability as a core growth strategy.

Currently, 360 AI models utilise this data and more than 950 experts and startups are actively working on the platform.\nAs part of proactive governance, the Integrated Digital Services Platform (IDSP) will deliver over 300 government services to 40 million citizens by 2027.

Mansour, Palestinian Permanent Observer to the United Nations, addresses the Security Council during the meeting on the situation in West Asia, at U.N. headquarters in New York City.\n| Photo Credit: Reuters\nA day after it skipped a joint appearance with other countries at the United Nations to condemn Israel for its plans for West Bank settlements, India signed a joint statement late on Wednesday (February 18, 2026) night.\nThe statement, which was read out by the Palestinian Ambassador to the UN, Riyad Mansour, on Tuesday (February 17) in New York, criticised the Israeli government for a number of moves to expand its control over the West Bank areas under the Palestinian Authority.\nAmong those who accompanied Mr. Mansour during the joint press call were diplomats from Arab nations, BRICS members, Quad partners Japan and Australia, European Union member states such as Germany, and all permanent members of the UN Security Council, except for the U.S.\nIndia’s initial decision not to sign the statement, which was endorsed by 85 countries, was seen as linked to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s travel to Israel on February 25-26 and his upcoming meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The decision was surprising given India’s traditional support for a Palestinian state and its past criticism of Israel’s settlement policy.\nHowever, more than 24 hours later, the government appeared to shift its position and signed the document.\n“More than 100 states and international organizations have joined the statement condemning Israel’s unilateral measures and rejecting annexation,” the Palestinian government announced late on Wednesday (February 18), including India’s name in the statement.\n“We reiterate our rejection of all measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem,” said the statement issued in New York. “Such measures violate international law, undermine the ongoing efforts for peace and stability in the region, run counter to the Comprehensive Plan, and jeopardize the prospect of reaching a peace agreement ending the conflict,” it added.\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who travelled to Delhi to attend the AI Impact Summit on Wednesday (February 18), had also issued a statement “condemning” the Israeli government’s plans to require documentation from existing landholders and ease restrictions on outsiders acquiring property in the West Bank.\n“The decision could lead to the dispossession of Palestinians of their property and risks expanding Israeli control over land in the area. Such measures, including Israel’s continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, are not only destabilizing but, as recalled by the International Court of Justice, unlawful,” the statement issued by the Secretary-General’s office said.\nThe External Affairs Ministry refused requests for a comment on the government’s decisions, first to stay away from the joint appearance and then to sign the statement.\nThe government’s decision to stay out of the statement was criticised by the Opposition and former diplomats, some of whom praised the decision to join the statement later.\nCongress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said Mr. Modi must “call out” Mr. Netanyahu during his visit to Israel next week and “publicly express India’s grave concern at what Israel is executing in the occupied West Bank”.\nIndia\n/\nIsrael-Palestine Conflict\n/\nunrest, conflicts and  war\n/\nIsrael\n/\nUnited Nations",

Harish Rao and earlier represented by her father and BRS chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao.\nIn an informal chat with the media, she said that the new party would be rooted firmly in Telangana and with its political ideology. On her choice of contest, she said that it would be either Siddpet or Bodhan.\nMs. Kavitha said that her party would continuously question the policies and actions of the Congress, Bharatiya Janata Party and Bharat Rashtra Samithi. She also predicted that the BJP’s presence in Telangana would gradually diminish.\nOn future electoral strategy, she said that her party would consider contesting the MPTC and ZPTC elections in alliance with another party. She was hopeful that by the time of the GHMC elections, the Election Commission would allot a symbol to her party, and asserted that the party would contest the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation polls on its own symbol.\nShe revealed that several leaders from the BRS were keen to join her new party and that many of them were already in touch with her. “I will share details when the time is right,” she said.\nResponding to criticism about the prospects of her new party, she questioned why failed male-led political experiments were rarely discussed. Why leaders such as Chiranjeevi and Devender Goud were not similarly scrutinised, and why Rajagopal Reddy’s political shifts were not discussed. “No one talks about them, but women are constantly undermined,” she said.",

        "content": "Karnataka has around 260 blood banks, including government and private facilities.\n| Photo Credit: FILE PHOTO\nIn a move aimed at bringing uniform quality standards across all blood centres, the State Health Department has made it mandatory for all blood banks in Karnataka to obtain accreditation from the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH) or certification under the National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) programme within a year.\nThe directive has been issued through a Government Order dated February 17, 2026, following a proposal from the Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS) and consultations with NABH authorities.\nThe proposal stated that ensuring all blood centres in the State function in accordance with the guidelines of the National Blood Transfusion Council, the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, the Directorate General of Health Services, New Delhi, the Karnataka State Blood Transfusion Council, and the directives of the State and Central governments is the responsibility of the Karnataka State Blood Transfusion Council.\nWith a view to preventing transfusion-transmitted infections and strengthening the proper management of blood centres, consultations were held with the NABH authorities before the decision was finalised, officials said.\nState Deputy Director (Blood Safety) Shakila N. told The Hindu on Thursday that the move was intended to reinforce systems governing blood collection, testing and storage. “Blood banks deal with life-saving services. There are multiple processes involved- from donor screening and blood collection to testing, component separation and storage. Each of these steps must meet defined standards, with proper infrastructure, trained human resources and calibrated equipment,” she said.\nKarnataka has around 260 blood banks, including government and private facilities. As per the order, all government blood banks must obtain the NQAS certification. The blood centres functioning under autonomous institutions of the government may opt for either NQAS certification or NABH accreditation. However, all private blood banks, which are not eligible under the government-run NQAS scheme, must obtain the NABH accreditation, according to the order.\nAll existing blood banks have been given one year to secure the prescribed accreditation. New blood banks will be required to obtain accreditation within one year from the date of receiving their licence.\nExisting blood banks have been given one year to comply. Newly licensed blood banks must obtain accreditation within one year from the date of licence. Licences are renewed once every five years, with periodic inspections by district-level officers. “Monitoring private blood banks on a day-to-day basis can be challenging. This move will ensure an additional layer of quality oversight,” Dr. Shakila said.\nReferring to reports from other States where lapses in testing allegedly resulted in transfusion-related infections, she said both the Central and State governments were keen to tighten safeguards.\nThe accreditation process involves documentation of standard operating procedures, infrastructure assessment and compliance checks, and may take eight to ten months. The cost of accreditation will be borne by the respective blood banks. Failure to obtain certification within the stipulated period will result in suspension of licence, the order stated.\nDr. Shakila said joint inspections by the State Drugs Control Department and the Health Department had identified procedural lapses in some blood banks in the past, and action had been initiated wherever necessary. “Safe blood is non-negotiable,” Dr. Shakila added.",

Accordingly, it has started the exercise to redeploy the existing staff at different levels to the three corporations holding consultations with different departments and experts on the options available.  The development assumes significance as litigations have been filed in the High Court over the reorganisation of the GHMC at a time when there is a freeze on altering the profile of administrative unit till the Census work is completed.\nThere are broadly three categories of employees: GHMC-born or those recruited directly to the corporation, officials and staff belonging to the Municipal Administration department in key sections like Town Planning and staff working on deputation from other departments like Forests. This is in addition to the huge number of contract and outsourcing workers engaged in different sections.\nOfficials see no scope for problems on account of redeployment, as factors like Presidential Orders and local status will not come into play. “Some employees are already in positions. Mechanism has to be evolved to redeploy the staff to make the three new corporations function effectively in discharge of their duties,”  senior officials told The Hindu.\nWhile redistribution of employees is unlikely to pose any major problems, officials, however, feel that the division of assets and liabilities between the three new bodies will be a challenging task before the government.",

The unions are insisting that arrears for the entire 38-month period be cleared, instead of the 26 months proposed by the government.\nAs part of the negotiations, KSRTC managing director Akram Pasha visited the protest site at Freedom Park in Bengaluru and held discussions with the agitating workers. Following a final round of talks, the Joint Action Committee announced that the strike would be temporarily halted for now.\nJAC convener Jayadevaraj Arasu said that  the decision was taken in view of the government’s partial response and in the interest of the public.\n“The Joint Action Committee has decided not to continue the strike from tomorrow. However, we have given the government a 10-day deadline until March 2. If our demands are not fully met by then, we will resume the agitation,” he said.\nHe further emphasised that all pending demands, including the complete implementation of the pay revision and full disbursal of arrears, must be addressed within the stipulated timeframe. “With the strike plan on hold for the moment, bus services will operate as usual from tomorrow,” he added.\nHowever, not all employees at the protest site were in agreement with the decision. Some workers present at Freedom Park reportedly objected to the temporary withdrawal and urged union leaders to continue the strike until all demands were met unconditionally. But JAC leaders convinced them.\nMeanwhile, RTC officials stated that the protest had little impact on bus services across the State on Thursday, with overall fleet utilisation exceeding 96%.\nA total of 12,458 scheduled departures were planned across the four corporations. Of these, 11,987 services were operated, resulting in an overall operational rate of 96.22%.\nAdditionally, 663 extra services were deployed, taking the total number of operated services to 12,650. This pushed the effective operational percentage, including additional trips, to 101.54 as of 10 a.m. on the day of the protest.\nKSRTC operated 3,806 out of its 4,177 scheduled departures, recording 91.12% operations. With 656 additional services run under ‘Jatra’ (temple fair) arrangements, its effective operational percentage rose to 106.82%.\nBMTC recorded near-full operations, running 3,540 services against 3,532 scheduled departures, achieving 100.23% efficiency without deploying any additional services.\nNWKRTC operated 2,250 of its 2,310 scheduled departures, registering 97.40% operations. With seven extra services operated to meet the jatra demand, its effective operation rate increased to 97.71%.\nKKRTC reported operating 2,391 out of 2,439 scheduled departures, achieving 98.03% operations.\nCommuters expressed relief over the development.\nPavan Kumar from Jayanagar, said, “There were no issues today. All buses operated as usual, and passengers did not face any inconvenience. However, I feel the government and the unions must resolve this issue permanently. Frequent protests create uncertainty, and ultimately it is commuters who suffer. The government should ensure that RTC employees receive their arrears on time. They are doing an essential public service.”\nThe current agitation follows earlier tensions between the unions and the government. In August 2025, the JAC announced an indefinite strike after talks with the government failed. The strike was later withdrawn following intervention by the Karnataka High Court.\nThe ‘Bengaluru Chalo’ protest was originally scheduled for January 29 but was postponed after veteran trade union leader H.V. Anantha Subba Rao, who was spearheading the agitation, passed away on January 28 following a cardiac arrest. The programme was subsequently rescheduled and held on February 19.",

File photo: Special Arrangement.\nBlaming YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) for the financial crisis that crippled the State, Finance Minister Payyavula Keshav said that the public debt stood at nearly ₹1.20 lakh crore even after 20 months of the coalition government’s formation. The TDP-led government inherited a mammoth debt of approximately ₹9.74 lakh crore from the YSRCP dispensation in June 2024.\nIt had since been a daily struggle for the Finance Department to run the show with meagre revenues on the one hand and a mountain of debt on the other, but the situation improved significantly as the State’s efforts were complemented by the Central support. However, much more remained to be done as the YSRCP government’s policies had a lasting impact, he observed, while cautioning the people against voting for the YSRCP again.\nGiving his reply to the general discussion on Budget 2026-27 in the Legislative Assembly on Thursday, Mr. Keshav said the first budget tabled by him had to clean up the mess created by the YSRCP and the second one just about managed to put the economy back on the tracks.\nThe third (the present one) shifted gears towards all-round progress, he claimed, and insisted that continuity of governance was a must for the State to prosper, for which the people should once again vote for the TDP-Jana Sena Party-BJP alliance. The YSRCP rule was characterised by corruption and fiscal profligacy, he remarked.\nFurther, Mr. Keshav said due emphasis had been laid on generating employment. Salaries and pensions were being paid before the first of every month. '’Focus has been laid on developing Visakhapatnam, Amaravati and Tirupati Economic Regions and the masterplan for the Visakhapatnam Economic Region has been drafted under the expert guidance of NITI Aayog. The Amaravati Economic Region is being studied,'’ he said.\nCompleting the irrigation projects was quite high on the government’s agenda. The Amaravati and Polavaram projects were taken up with renewed vigour. Industrial projects were taking tangible shape wherever lands were allotted, unlike during the YSRCP regime when entrepreneurs fled from the State due to hostile conditions. Mr. Keshav added.",

Mr. Parmelin, who also met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi for bilateral talks on Thursday (February 19, 2026) on the sidelines of the AI summit in New Delhi, said they had discussed cooperating in innovation on artificial intelligence, multilateral cooperation, and trade ties after the conclusion of the India-EFTA trade agreement in 2024.\nFollow India AI Summit 2026 Day 4 Highlights\n“Switzerland is looking forward to hosting the 2027 AI Summit in Geneva — and to working with the subsequent incoming host of the 2028 AI Summit, the United Arab Emirates, as partner for the Geneva Summit,” Mr. Parmelin told journalists at Switzerland’s “Country Pavilion” at the Bharat Mandapam complex after the plenary session. “It will also consolidate our role as a leading centre for innovation and research in AI,” he added, saying that the next summit would focus on international law aspects of AI.\nWhen asked about the domination of the two big AI players U.S. and China, who together account for more than 70% of the global AI industry, Mr. Parmelin said smaller countries should “organise” together and build infrastructure, while recognising specific technological breakthroughs in many of the other countries.\n“It is very important that we work together so that the [technological future of the world] is not just in a few hands of big powers,” Mr. Parmelin said in response to a question from The Hindu. “We know some countries have taken a way forward, and it’s very important that good governance is brought to everyone.

It was released at a hall in Guwahati named after Manabendra Sarma, a Congress leader murdered in the 1990s.\nThe charge sheet accused the BJP of establishing a parallel economy by patronising and promoting illegal activities, including rat-hole coal mining, and turning Assam into a conduit for drugs, Burmese areca nuts, and other contraband items from across the international borders.\nIt claimed that Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, Ministers close to him, and members of his family accumulated illegal wealth, generating “slush funds through an organised syndicate system” and investing the proceeds in real estate, shell companies, and other ventures.\nThe document touched upon Assam’s “rising debts, irresponsible governance, and financial mismanagement”. It said that the State’s outstanding debt crossed ₹2 lakh crore, increasing the financial burden on people and future generations.\n“The government is taking loans not for reforms or productive investments, but to fund various freebies aimed at electoral winnability… The money of the people of Assam, which should have been used to build infrastructure and provide water, roads, and basic amenities, is instead being diverted and used primarily for political purposes,” the document read.\nCongress also accused the BJP government of sabotaging the “universally accepted Assam Accord of 1985” and the “deliberate non-implementation of Clause 6 that guarantees the protection of Assamese Identity” despite repeated assurances.\nThe charge sheet alleged that the BJP undermined the sanctity of the Assam Accord by introducing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the Immigration and Foreigners (Exemption) Order, 2025. It stated that the BJP stalled the exercise to update the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and blackmailed communities by promoting a fear psychosis through official channels.\nCriticising the BJP for failing to declare the perennial problems of floods and riverbank erosion in Assam as a national disaster, the document highlighted the State government’s inability to create adequate jobs and grant Scheduled Tribe status to six communities — Chutia, Koch-Rajbongshi, Matak, Moran, Tai Ahom, and Tea Tribes.\nThe document also said the BJP had weakened and stifled public education, leaving children of the poor in the lurch.

        "title": "RSS Affiliate Laghu Udyog Bharati Urges Govt To Drop Blue Line Plan For Antimicrobial Drugs",
        "content": "A month after the central government mandated marking antimicrobial drugs with a conspicuous blue vertical line, RSS-affiliated Laghu Udyog Bharati (LUB) has urged the health ministry not to proceed with the final notification, arguing that the move would impose heavy economic and environmental costs without meaningfully addressing antimicrobial misuse.\nIn a letter dated February 18, seen by News18, LUB has requested the government “to reconsider the proposed amendment under global prospective and consider our above factful submission and do not go for final notification\".\nLUB is an all-India organisation representing micro and small enterprises (MSMEs) and claims to represent over 64,000 members across the country.\nThe blue line proposal was introduced through draft notification in January, proposing an amendment to Rule 96 of the Drugs Rules, 1945, to mandate “a conspicuous blue vertical strip on the labels of antimicrobial drugs\".\nAntimicrobial drugs include antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals and antiparasitic medicines used to treat infections caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites. India has been grappling with rising antimicrobial resistance (AMR), largely driven by irrational use, self-medication and over-the-counter availability of antibiotics despite prescription requirements.\nThe proposed blue line is intended to function as a clear visual identifier, reinforcing that these medicines should be used strictly under medical supervision. It builds on earlier regulatory efforts such as the red line warning introduced in 1993 and the later red box warning under Schedule H1.\nHowever, LUB argues that past visual labelling interventions have not significantly altered misuse patterns. In its letter, the organisation states, “Experience from earlier labelling interventions shows that such changes do not materially impact misuse.\" It notes that despite decades of red line and red box warnings, “irrational use and over-the-counter sale of antibiotics continue\".\nIn its representation, seen by News18, LUB contends that the amendment would require manufacturers to redesign labels, revise approved artworks and discard existing packaging material. “The proposed requirement will necessitate redesigning of labels, revision of approved artworks, and disposal of existing printed packaging material, resulting in significant financial and operational burden, particularly for MSME manufacturers,\" the letter said. It warns that sudden implementation could lead to “losses running into crores of rupees for even a single manufacturing unit\".\nThe organisation also flags environmental implications, pointing out that pharmaceutical packaging relies on pre-printed aluminium foils and specialised printing cylinders. Large-scale destruction of these materials, it said, would generate industrial waste and increase pollution. The letter cautions that repeated labelling changes would lead to “high economic and environmental costs without delivering commensurate public health benefits\".\nLUB further argues that antimicrobial drugs are already governed under Schedule H and Schedule H1 with specific labelling and prescription requirements. According to the letter, “The addition of another visual identifier, such as a blue line, may create confusion among healthcare professionals and patients rather than improving rational use.\" It also raises concerns that mandatory domestic labelling changes could disrupt export packaging and regulatory harmonisation, potentially affecting manufacturing efficiency and India’s competitiveness.\nUltimately, the organisation maintains that the core issue lies in weak enforcement at the distribution and retail level. “Antimicrobial misuse is primarily driven by weak enforcement at the distribution and retail level, where antibiotics continue to be available over the counter despite existing legal restrictions,\" the letter stated, suggesting stronger enforcement and accountability measures rather than additional visual markers.\nConcluding the letter, LUB has urged the ministry to take a broader view before proceeding, stating: “In view of the above, we humbly request the ministry to reconsider the proposed amendment under global prospective and consider our above factful submission and do not go for final notification.\"\nLatest Blogs",

Stuck for more than an hour. Due to the VVIP movement, our movement gets restricted. Nobody cares for normal people who are working hard every day,\" one commuter wrote.\nOthers reported frequent rerouting on navigation apps as roads were abruptly closed. Many advised residents to rely on the Delhi Metro instead of private vehicles during the summit period.\nThe Delhi Traffic Police had earlier issued an advisory stating that elaborate arrangements and traffic regulations were being implemented from February 16 to 20 for the smooth conduct of the AI Impact Summit at Bharat Mandapam, which is being attended by heads of state, ministers and foreign delegates.\nAccording to the advisory, traffic movement was restricted or regulated on key roads including Mathura Road, Subramania Bharti Marg, Rajesh Pilot Marg, Janpath, Firoze Shah Road, Safdarjung Road and Kartavya Path, among others. Certain stretches like Bhairon Marg and parts of Mathura Road were designated restricted zones during route movement.\nMeanwhile, in his keynote address, the former English Prime Minister called India the ideal venue for shaping the future of artificial intelligence, saying there was “no better place\" to deliberate on global AI transformation.\nPraising India’s digital public infrastructure such as Aadhaar, UPI and Ayushman Bharat Health Accounts, he said that the country was uniquely positioned to drive the next phase of AI’s global journey — not only for developed nations but also for the developing world.\nHighlighting the speed of AI adoption, he noted that while the telephone took 75 years to reach 100 million users and the internet seven years, ChatGPT reached that milestone in just two months.\nThe India AI Impact Summit 2026, the first global AI summit to be hosted in the Global South, has brought together representatives from more than 110 countries to advance discussions on AI governance, safety and inclusive growth.\n(With inputs from agencies)\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "After the recent elections in Bangladesh, intelligence agencies in India have sounded an alarm over Rohingya refugees, illegal immigration, terror networks and demographic changes in West Bengal ahead of the upcoming Assembly polls, sources told CNN-News18.\nIn an election marred by violence targeting religious minorities and widespread irregularities, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), led by former PM Khaleda Zia’s son Tarique Rahman, secured a strong mandate, winning 209 of the 299 seats, while the Jamaat-e-Islami secured 68 seats, making it the chief opposition party. Ousted PM Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League was banned from contesting the polls.\nHowever, intelligence agencies have warned that Pakistan’s ISI is colluding with the Jamaat-e-Islami and using its seats in Bangladesh’s Satkhira and Chuadanga to push illegal immigrants into West Bengal’s Nadia and Murshidabad districts, according to sources.\nAdditionally, Jamaat’s radical spread is being used to activate terror sleeper cells in North 24 Parganas to influence voter turnout during the West Bengal Assembly elections, sources said. These sleeper cells are also aiming to disrupt the elections in Malda.\nAttempts At Demographic Change In Bengal\nAccording to sources, Malda’s Muslim population is estimated at 55-60%, which is mainly due to cross-border migration and Jamaat-e-Islami’s victory in Bangladesh’s Chapainawabganj, which lies close to Bengal’s Malda and Murshidabad districts.\nAdditionally, intelligence agencies warned of attempts at demographic change and settlements of sleeper cells affiliated with terror groups with the help of Rohingya networks.\nGroups such as ARSA (Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army), RSO (Rohingya Solidarity Organisation), and JMB (Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh) are likely to coordinate their activities in Cox’s Bazar following the Bangladesh elections. This is expected to affect West Bengal’s Uttar Dinajpur district, with madrasa-linked networks in Birbhum potentially serving as key hubs.\nPakistan-China-Bangladesh Links\nIntelligence reports also pointed to links involving Pakistan and China, allegedly aimed at targeting Siliguri through the Kurigram airbase. Jamaat’s ideological infiltration into West Bengal’s borders could have potential for communal riots in Jalpaiguri and may impact voter safety and Trinamool Congress’ (TMC) hold in 2026.\nSeveral steps have been taken recently to address the issue, including the return of a large number of undocumented Bangladeshis in North 24 Parganas during the Election Commission’s Special Intensive Revision (SIR) process. BSF reported that at least 150–200 people are returning daily after verification, biometric checks and screening of criminal records.\nMigrants working as ragpickers, labourers or domestic workers, who have been living in India for more than 10 years using forged Aadhaar cards, voter IDs, and ration cards, are also returning due to fear of arrest and imprisonment linked to the SIR exercise.\nLatest Blogs",

The court said it was “shocking to note the callous and casual manner in which records are maintained, and the income generated from the sale of sacred offerings is accounted for.\"\nThe judges observed that even a small shopkeeper would be expected to maintain better financial discipline. “Even a person running a modest petty shop would be expected to maintain far better accounting discipline to ensure that income and stock are properly reconciled,\" the court remarked.\nAccording to the proceedings, ghee packets were issued to counters after being recorded in notebooks informally referred to as “Kutti Books\". Separate notebooks were maintained for each counter and kept in the temple office. These books recorded the number of packets issued along with the signatures of the staff receiving them.\nInvestigating officers produced one such 200-page school notebook before the court, relating to the Maramathu-II counter. On examining it, the court noted that entries covering the period from 17 November 2025 to 30 December 2025 occupied only about 20 pages. The notebook also contained several corrections, overwriting and interlineations, which drew the court’s disapproval.\nThe court further observed that the Temple Board and its officials were expected to exercise much greater supervision, especially since the sale of offerings generates several lakhs of rupees daily.\nLatest Blogs",

According to PTI, Ranganath said his constituency, Kunigal Taluk, is “mostly rural and depends heavily on farming\". He noted that many young men continue to live in villages and earn their livelihood through agriculture, but “many women are not willing to marry them\".\nThe MLA pointed out that several men remain unmarried even after turning 30 and are facing difficulties because of this social trend. Highlighting what he described as an urgent concern in rural areas, he wrote, “So, I request that in the next session, a special allowance and special status be given to women who marry men living in villages and working in agriculture.\"\nRanganath believes such a measure would help resolve the problems faced by young farmers in rural areas and encourage greater support for farming livelihoods. He has called for a structured discussion in the Assembly and the formulation of a policy at the earliest.\nThe proposal has triggered debate across Karnataka’s rural belt. While many see it as a positive intervention to strengthen agriculture socially and encourage young farmers, others are examining it from the perspective of social balance and economic feasibility.\nThere has been no official response yet from the Chief Minister’s office.\nThe challenge of delayed marriages among young men in agrarian communities has persisted for years in parts of the state.

        "content": "Thursday marked the fourth—and most high-profile—day of the AI Impact Summit 2026 being held at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi as global leaders such as United Nations chief Antonio Guterres and French President Emmanuel Macron graced the occasion, discussing the breakneck rise of a technology that’s igniting both investor excitement and serious unease in equal measure.\nThe stellar line-up included Prime Minister Narendra Modi; Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani; Sunil Bharti Mittal, Founder and Chairman, Bharti Enterprises; Shantanu Narayen, Chairman and CEO, Adobe; Dario Amodei, CEO, Anthropic; Rishad Premji, Executive Chairman, Wipro; and Sam Altman, CEO, OpenAI.\nAs PM Modi positioned India as a future global AI hub built on inclusion, ethics and “AI for all,\" urging that the technology empower humanity rather than concentrate power, Pichai described India as being on an “extraordinary trajectory\" in AI adoption and talent and Ambani underscored massive private-sector investment bets on India’s AI future.\nHere’s a look at who said what at the summit:\nPM Narendra Modi: Unveiling his human-centric ‘MANAV’ vision for Artificial Intelligence at the AI Impact Summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi mentioned that the future of AI must be moral, sovereign and valid.\nIndia’s vision for AI is encapsulated in the word MANAV, which means human. pic.twitter.com/4IqFOg7YPx— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) February 19, 2026\nDecoding MANAV, the prime minister said the Hindi word for “human\" is also an acronym that captures India’s five core principles for AI: Moral and ethical systems, Accountable governance, National sovereignty (especially data rights), Accessible and inclusive technology, and Valid, legitimate AI systems that people can trust.\nEmphasising the need to place people at the heart of technological transformation, Modi called for making “skilling, reskilling, and lifelong learning a mass movement\" to prepare societies for the rapidly evolving digital era.\n“Artificial intelligence marks a transformative chapter in human history. India is not just a part of the AI revolution, but is leading and shaping it,\" he said in the presence of world leaders and CEOs of leading companies.\nThe prime minister also described AI as a historic transformation comparable to the invention of wireless communication. “When signals were first transmitted wirelessly, no one imagined that the entire world would one day be connected in real time. Artificial Intelligence is such a transformation of human history. What we are seeing today, what we are predicting, is just the beginning of its impact.\"\nIndia sees the future in AI, said the prime minister, as he said he believes that any model that succeeds in India’s scale and diversity can be deployed anywhere in the world.\nMukesh Ambani: The Chairman and Managing Director of Reliance Industries Limited likened Artificial Intelligence to Akshay Patra from the Mahabharat, saying it was not just another technology.\nSTORY | Jio with Reliance to invest Rs 10 lakh crore over 7 years: Mukesh AmbaniBillionaire Mukesh Ambani on Thursday announced Rs 10 lakh crore investment by his group as he promised to revolutionise artificial intelligence, as he did with mobile data.\nREAD:… pic.twitter.com/mO0xSCLomh\n— Press Trust of India (@PTI_News) February 19, 2026\n“Artificial Intelligence is not just another technology. For the first time, humans are creating human-like systems that can learn, speak, analyse, move, and produce autonomously. AI is the mantra that powers every yantra or every machine and system to work faster, better, and smarter. I see AI as a modern-day Akshay Patra, the legendary vessel in the Mahabharat that provided endless nourishment to all. Likewise, AI offers limitless augmentation in knowledge, efficiency, and productivity.\"\nAmbani said Reliance Jio will invest Rs 10 lakh crore over the next seven years towards AI, adding that Jio will also make AI widely affordable like it had done for internet data. “Jio has already started building AI applications for India’s most pressing challenges in inclusive development,\" he said.\nAsked about AI snatching jobs, Ambani sounded positive, saying the new technology will not eliminate jobs but create high-skill employment opportunities. “My confidence is validated by an undeniable truth. In the coming decades, no country in the world can match India’s strength in demography, democracy, development, digital infrastructure, data generation, AI harvest. India is the world’s largest mobile data consumer. Nearly 1 billion internet users, data costs among the lowest globally. And in terms of quality, there is no difference between Delhi and the remotest Indian village,\" he said.\n“Second, Aadhaar, 1.4 billion digital IDs. Third, UPI processes over 12 billion transactions monthly. Fourth, India ranks among the top three startup ecosystems with 100,000 startups and 100 plus unicorns. Fifth, India’s secure and inclusive digital public infrastructure stack is now being adopted by countries around the globe,\" he added, noting that social relevance, not momentary craze, should drive AI growth in India.\nAntonio Guterres: The UN Secretary General, while praising the summit, cautioned that the future of Artificial Intelligence cannot be decided by a handful of countries or a few billionaires. “Done right, AI can advance sustainable development goals, accelerate breakthroughs in medicine, expand learning opportunities, strengthen food security, bolster climate action and disaster preparedness and improve access to vital public services,\" he said, adding: “But it can also deepen inequality, amplify bias and fuel harm. As AI’s energy and water demand soar, data centres and supply chains must switch to clean power.\"\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres congratulated Prime Minister Narendra Modi for India’s leadership in hosting the first AI Summit in the Global South.He said AI must benefit everyone and can advance the Sustainable Development Goals, accelerate medical discoveries,… pic.twitter.com/Pa1cKYLhac\n— PB-SHABD (@PBSHABD) February 19, 2026\nGuterres went on to say: “The meeting in India has special meaning. It brings this conversation closer to the realities shaping much of the world. Because the future of AI cannot be decided by a handful of countries or left to the whims of a few billionaires.\"\nEmmanuel Macron: Hailing India’s role in having “built what no other country can\", the French President shared an example as he addressed the summit, saying: “10 years ago, a street vendor in Mumbai could not open a bank account. No address, no papers, no access… but today that same vendor accepts payments on his phone. That is not a technology story. That is a civilisational story.\"\n“Ten years ago, a street vendor in Mumbai could not open a bank account — no address, no documents, no access.

They call it the India Stack Open Interoperable Sovereign. That is what this summit is about. We are clearly at the beginning of a huge acceleration, and you [PM Modi] perfectly described it during your interventions…\" Saying India had proved the world wrong, Macron added: “Ten years ago, the world said 1.4 billion people could not be brought into the digital economy. India proved them wrong. And today, some say AI is a game only the biggest can play…\"\nThe French President added: “India and France, with Europe and our partners, those who believe in our approach… might have a different way… the future of AI will be built by those who combine innovation and responsibility, technology with humanity, and India and France will help shape this future.\"\nDario Amodei: The chief executive of the US artificial intelligence company Anthropic termed the “energy and ambition in this room and across India incredible\" and said: “I’ve been spending the last few days meeting with Indian builders and enterprises, and the energy to build together here is palpable, unlike anywhere else\".\nAt the India AI-Impact Summit 2026 in Bharat Mandapam, New Delhi, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei highlighted that the energy to build in India is unmatched.He emphasized India’s “absolutely central role\" in shaping AI opportunities and risks, noting that as the world’s largest… pic.twitter.com/XA3qOMYRPQ\n— PB-SHABD (@PBSHABD) February 19, 2026\nPointing to the company’s growing focus on India, he revealed that Anthropic has launched a new office in Bengaluru and named veteran business leader Irena Ghose, who brings three decades of experience building companies in India, as managing director of Anthropic India. He added that the company has secured fresh partnerships with leading Indian firms, including Infosys.\nAmodei argued that society is already far down the path where just a few years are left before AI systems outperform the vast majority of people in most areas of thinking and expertise.\n“There are only a small number of years for AI models to surpass the cognitive capabilities of most humans for most things. We’re increasingly close to what I’ve called a country of geniuses in a data centre, a set of AI agents that are more capable than most humans at most things and can coordinate at superhuman speed,\" he said.\nSam Altman: The OpenAI CEO praised India’s rapid adoption of Artificial Intelligence, saying: “It is amazing to be here, obviously the work happening in India and the adoption of AI is leading the world, and I can’t wait to see what goes next. This will be one of the biggest markets for AI in the world, and I think India will have a huge amount of influence.\"\nMr. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, delivered a keynote address highlighting the remarkable progress India has made in making AI accessible to millions.

Linking AI’s evolution to India’s democratic context, Altman said, “The world’s largest democracy is well positioned to lead AI—not just to build it, but to shape it and decide what our future is going to look like.\"\nHe noted that many current roles, particularly those driven by cognitive repetition, data processing, and even parts of software development will be reshaped as AI systems become more capable. “More than 100 million people in India use ChatGPT every week, and more than a third of them are students.\" India, he added, is also the fastest-growing market globally for OpenAI.\nSundar Pichai: Praising India’s transformation, the Alphabet CEO said he is always struck by the pace of change in the country. Pichai, contrasting the change that Andhra Pradesh has undergone, said he once travelled by train through Visakhapatnam. “Today, Google is building a full-stack AI hub in the same city as part of its $15 billion infrastructure investment in India,\" he said. Pichai added it was this technology that “can improve lives at once on a generation scale and can improve billions of lives with AI\".\nAddressing the India AI Action Summit today was a profound personal honor.AI can improve billions of lives and solve some of the hardest problems in science.\nThe best outcomes of AI are not guaranteed. We must pursue AI boldly, approach it responsibly, and work together…\n— Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) February 19, 2026\nThe Alphabet top boss, however, issued a warning regarding equitable access to technology, warning that the current digital divide must not become an “AI divide\".\nAnnouncing the “America-India Connect\" initiative, Pichai described it as a comprehensive digital infrastructure and AI investment plan that could potentially reshape the future of global tech collaborations and propel India’s position in the global digital economy. The new initiative is an extension of Google’s earlier announced $15 billion five-year AI investment in India, which was focused on a mega AI hub in Visakhapatnam.\nLatest Blogs",

Follow Live Updates\nAddressing the gathering at Bharat Mandapam, he said, “While some see fear in AI, others see the future. I can say with utmost pride that India finds its future in Artificial Intelligence,\" underlining the country’s forward-looking approach to the technology.\nHighlighting the rapid pace of change in the digital era, the Prime Minister said, “AI is making machines intelligent, but more than that, it is increasing human capabilities manyfold. There is only one difference: this time, the speed is unprecedented, and the scale is also unexpected. Earlier, the impact of technology used to take decades to be visible. Today, the journey from machine learning to learning machines is faster, deeper and wider than ever.\"\nStressing the responsibility that comes with such transformative power, Modi drew parallels with nuclear technology and urged global reflection.\n“We have to have a big vision and shoulder an equally big responsibility. Along with the present generation, we also have to worry about what form of AI we will hand over to the coming generations. Therefore, the real question today is not what Artificial Intelligence can do in the future. The question is, what do we do with Artificial Intelligence in the present?

        "content": "When people talk about higher education in Delhi-NCR, Galgotias University is often part of the conversation. The university is known for its courses, campus life and large student base.\nRight now, it is also in the news due to a controversy over a robot dog on campus. At the same time, many are looking at the journey of its founder, Suneel Galgotia, and how his family business grew over the decades.\nHow Suneel Galgotia Built The Institution\nGalgotias University was set up in 2011 near the Yamuna Expressway in Greater Noida. It offers many undergraduate, postgraduate and PhD courses. Today, the university is led by Dhruv Galgotia, the son of Suneel Galgotia, who serves as CEO.\nThe roots of this large education group go back many years. The Galgotia family once owned a bookstore called ‘E.D. Galgotia & Sons’ in Connaught Place, Delhi. The shop was started in 1933 at B-17, Inner Circle, during the British Raj. It became a well-known place for books and stayed open for over 80 years.\nSuneel Galgotia grew up around this bookstore. Later, when he took charge of the family business, he decided to expand. In the 1980s, he started Galgotia Publications. Over time, he moved further into the education sector.\nIn 2000, he began Galgotias Institute of Management and Technology (GIMT) with just 40 students. After that, he launched Galgotias College of Engineering and Technology. In 2011, he established Galgotias University in Greater Noida.\nFrom Small Bookshop To Rs 3000 Crore Group\nWhat began as a single bookstore slowly turned into a large education group. Today, reportedly more than 40,000 students study under the Galgotias banner. Students from over 40 countries come here for higher education, and alumni are spread across 96 nations.\nAs per reports, the family’s education business is estimated to be worth around Rs 3000 crore. Over the years, the group expanded step by step, adding new institutes and courses.\nThe original Galgotia Book Shop at B-17 is now marked as closed. Reports suggest it shut down around 2015 due to online competition and changes in the area. Another listing of E.D. Galgotia and Sons at No. 21 in Connaught Place reportedly remained on some directories with working hours (9:30 AM–6:30 PM, closed Sundays), but there is no clear update about its current operations.\nMeanwhile, the Galgotias group now runs bookstores within its university campuses in Noida.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "The Supreme Court on Thursday slammed the freebies culture ahead of the elections and said that it was high time to revisit such policies, as it hampers the country’s economic development. Further coming down heavily on the Tamil Nadu government in view of the distribution of ‘freebies’ before elections, the apex court questioned, “What kind of culture are you trying to cultivate?\"\nThe top court’s comments came in regard to the Tamil Nadu Power Distribution Corporation Ltd’s plea, which proposed to provide free electricity to all, irrespective of the financial status of consumers.\nA bench comprising Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi emphasised that while it is the state’s responsibility is to empower its people, giving out freebies from morning to night is not the way to build the nation. Most states are already running a revenue deficit, and such policies only exacerbate the situation, leaving no funds for development.\n“Most of the states in the country are revenue-deficient states, and yet they are offering such freebies, overlooking development,\" the Bench said.\nThe bench said economic development of the nation gets hampered with this kind of largesse distribution and states should work to open avenues for employment instead of giving free food, cycles, electricity to all.\nFollowing this, the Supreme Court issued a notice to the Centre and others on the plea of the DMK government-led power distribution firm, which proposes to provide free electricity. The power firm has challenged a rule of the Electricity Amendment Rules, 2024.\n“What kind of culture are we developing in India? It is understandable that as part of the welfare measure, you want to provide to those who are incapable of paying the electricity charges. But without drawing a distinction between those who can afford and those who cannot, you start distributing. Will it not amount to an appeasing policy,\" CJI Surya Kant asked.\nThe Bench further raised questions on the sudden decision of the Tamil Nadu power firm to provide free electricity.\n“The states should work to open avenues for employment. If you start giving free food from morning to evening, then free cycle, then free electricity, then who will work and then what will happen to the work culture,\" the CJI said.\nThe bench said states, instead of spending on development projects, do two jobs – paying salaries and distributing such largesse.\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "Bihar Unveils ‘Game-Changing’ E-Voting At AI Summit 2026 — But Is India’s First-Of-Its-Kind System Fraud-Proof?",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has entered into public systems such as elections. At the India-AI Impact Summit 2026, one of the most talked-about presentations came from Bihar’s State Election Commission which showcased a mobile-based AI-driven remote voting system.\nAccording to a report in NDTV, the commission is preparing to scale this model further and may expand it for use in the next Assembly elections.\nLet’s take a look at this tech innovation in detail.\nWhat Is Bihar’s AI-Based Remote Voting Model?\nBihar has introduced what it calls India’s first mobile-enabled remote voting platform. The system was first used during the 2025 urban local body elections and later presented at the summit as a model of digital governance.\nThe voting facility works through dedicated Android application, namely “e-Voting SECBHR\" which is developed by the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) in collaboration with the State Election Commission.\nThe system is designed mainly for people who face difficulty reaching polling booths. This includes migrant workers living outside their home districts, students, senior citizens, pregnant women, persons with disabilities and those who are unwell.\nHow Does The System Work?\nTo vote remotely, users must download the official app on an Android phone. Accessing the app requires verification via OTP which will be sent on the mobile number provided.\nIt is followed by live selfie verification. The system uses AI-based facial recognition to match the selfie with the voter’s EPIC (Electors Photo Identity Card) ID photograph. Once identity checks are cleared, the voter can cast their vote through the app.\nThe system was first used live on June 28 last year during municipal by-elections.\nWhat Security Measures Does The System Use?\nAs per the reports, platform has several layers of protection. These include AI facial recognition combined with liveness detection to ensure that a real person is present during verification.\nBefore the vote is recorded, OTP authentication and dual encryption are needed to be done. After the votes are casted, they are encrypted and stored using blockchain technology which is a tamper-resistant record.\nThe are audit trails similar to Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) as well. After polling ends, decryption is allowed only through secure digital signatures and multi-factor authentication by election authorities.\nWhat Features Ensure That There Is No Tampering?\nBlockchain plays a central role in protecting votes. Each vote is encrypted, anonymised and added as a new block in a decentralised ledger.\nTo alter a vote, someone would need to rewrite the entire blockchain across multiple distributed nodes which officials say is practically impossible due to computational limits.\nDecryption keys are only known to election authorities. And they are used only after polling concludes.\nHow Is Voter Privacy Ensured?\nOfficials say the system has been designed to protect voter secrecy at every stage. Before a vote is recorded, it is encrypted and de-identified so that the identity of the voter is not linked to the choice made. The verification of identity happens at the beginning of the process through EPIC-linked facial recognition, liveness detection and OTP authentication. Once verification is complete, the vote is anonymised and stored on a blockchain-backed ledger using secure hashing and smart contracts.\nFor counting, decryption is tightly controlled. It requires the use of Returning Officers’ Digital Signature Certificates (DSCs), along with two-factor authentication and post-poll hash verification. Authorities say this ensures that results can be audited without revealing how any individual voted.\nWhat Are The Potential Vulnerabilities?\nDespite strong safety measures, some risks also loom. It allows up to two voters to register on a single device.\nThere are also fears about impersonation and misuse especially in households where one individual may influence another’s vote. Initial verification partly relies on voter ID entry and there have been reports of facial recognition failures in some attempts.\nThe system is currently available only on Android devices which excludes iOS users.\nWhat Are The Privacy Concerns Related To The System?\nThis application collects personal data such as voter ID details, phone numbers, biometric information and device metadata.\nNaturally, this raises a question: How long this data will be stored? And whether there are clear policies on third-party access?\nHow Has The System Been Evaluated So Far?\nDuring the pilot phase, out of 14,804 attempts, 3,830 mock registrations were successfully completed.\nBihar officials maintain that EPIC-linked checks, encryption layers and post-poll decryption controls ensure that only genuine voters participate and that ballots remain secret.\nBut cybersecurity experts and organisations such as the Internet Freedom Foundation have urged caution. They recommend stronger oversight and regulatory clarity before expanding the system to full-scale Assembly elections.\nLatest Blogs",

Without warning, they opened indiscriminate fire on him from close range, killing him on the spot and critically injuring his cousin, who was rushed to a nearby hospital.\nSenior officers reached the scene soon after the incident, cordoned off the area and launched a manhunt for the attackers. Forensic teams are scanning CCTV footage from the venue and surrounding areas as part of the investigation. Police have stated that the motive remains unclear, although preliminary investigations are underway.\nThe brazen shooting comes amid heightened tensions in the state. It follows several high-profile attacks on politicians in recent weeks, prompting criticism from opposition leaders who have blamed the ruling AAP government for a deteriorating security climate.\nBJP leader Jaiveer Shergill condemned the incident on social media, saying, “Another day, another broad daylight murder in Punjab. AAP sarpanch shot dead in a wedding function in Tarn Taran, Punjab!

        "content": "The Centre issued a stern warning to all exhibitors after the Galgotias University sparked a major controversy at the high-profile India AI Impact Summit 2026 in New Delhi by allegedly presenting a Chinese robodog as its own.\nFollowing the controversy, IT Secretary S Krishnan said the government does not want any exhibitor to showcase items that are not their own. “We do not want such exhibits to continue,\" he said, after organisers asked Galgotias University to vacate its stall.\nThis came after the Greater Noida-based Galgotias University faced intense criticism after reports suggested that the Unitree Go2 robotic dog was displayed under the name “Orion,\" prompting allegations that imported technology was being presented as indigenously developed.\nA clip went viral showing Galgotias’ Professor Neha Singh introducing the Robodog as ‘Orion’ and saying it was developed by the Centre of Excellence of the institution. Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi said the incident brought significant damage to the country and the AI Summit.\nCongress leader and Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi described the event as a “disorganised PR spectacle\" where Indian data is being showcased alongside Chinese products.\nKrishnan said the government would not tolerate exhibits misrepresented as original creations. “We want genuine and actual work to be reflected in the way that people exhibit in expos. The idea is not to sort of use this as an opportunity in any other fashion. We don’t want the controversy surrounding the exhibits presented here. So I think it’s essential that a code is followed there. Misinformation cannot be encouraged,\" he added.\nAbhishek Singh, Additional Secretary in Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, said the intention is not to stifle innovation but it should not be misleading. The controversy “should not overshadow the kind of effort that the others have put in,\" he said.\nGalgotias Asked To Vacate AI Summit\nLater, authorities asked the Galgotias University to vacate the AI Impact Summit Expo following the allegations. The staff and students of Galgotias University vacated their stall, and power was reportedly cut off at the Galgotias University pavilion after the institution was asked to leave the venue.\nGovernment sources said the Centre has taken the matter seriously and that a clear message has been conveyed to all exhibitors regarding compliance and transparency at the summit.\nHowever, the university defended itself by saying that it had never claimed to have built the device. “Galgotias has not built this robodog, nor have we claimed to do so,\" it said in a statement.\n“We at Galgotias, faculty and students, are deeply pained by the propaganda campaign against our university. We would like to clearly state that the robotic programming is part of our endeavour to make students learn AI programming and develop & deploy real world skills using globally available tools and resources, given developing AI talent is need of an hour,\" the university in another statement.\nThe India AI Impact Summit, billed as a flagship event in the Global South, is underway in Delhi and is expected to host at least 20 heads of state and governments, including French President Emmanuel Macron and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the event on Thursday.\n(with inputs from PTI)\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "Ram Temple Fuels Ayodhya’s Economic Surge: Study Projects Rs 4 Lakh Crore Tourism Revenue",
        "content": "The construction and consecration of the Ram Janmabhoomi Temple in January 2024 has significantly reshaped Ayodhya’s economic landscape, leading a surge in tourism, investment and job creation, according to a new study by Indian Institute of Management Lucknow (IIM Lucknow).\nThe report, titled “Economic Renaissance of Ayodhya,\" examined the transformation of the temple town following the consecration of the grand temple. The report also described how faith-led infrastructure has become a durable growth driver, helping Ayodhya pivot from a low-capacity pilgrimage town to a high-footfall tourism hub.\nThe study has been authored by Venkataramanaiah Saddikuti of IIM Lucknow, KV Raju, Professor Emeritus at Chanakya University and economic advisor to the Uttar Pradesh government, and Gopika Varma of Indian Institute of Management Rohtak.\nAccording to the study, more than 11 crore (110 million) devotees visited Ayodhya within the first six months after the consecration. Annual footfall is now projected at 5–6 crore, placing the city among India’s leading religious tourism destinations.\nBefore the temple’s construction, Ayodhya’s economy revolved around small-scale pilgrimage activity. Annual visitor numbers were modest, hospitality capacity was limited, national hotel chains had negligible presence, and the absence of an airport constrained connectivity. Employment opportunities were limited, leading to youth migration.\nPost-consecration, redevelopment and capacity expansion projects worth approximately Rs 85,000 crore are underway, spanning roads, railways, urban renewal and airport expansion. These investments have helped crowd in private capital and expand the services sector.\nTourism-led economic activity is projected to generate Rs 20,000–25,000 crore in tax revenues over the medium term. The study estimated that tourism spending in Uttar Pradesh could cross Rs 4 lakh crore, with Ayodhya contributing a significant share.\n“The scale of the economic turnaround surprised us. When we began the study, we did not anticipate such a sharp enrichment of the region. The temple has acted as a catalyst, and infrastructure has converted footfall into sustained economic activity,\" professor Saddikuti told Moneycontrol. “This is not a one-off spike. We are seeing repeat visitation, longer stays and higher spend per visitor, which is what makes the model durable,\" he added.\nIt is noteworthy that after assuming office in 2017, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath accelerated the temple economy framework, coupling temple development with modern infrastructure expansion in Ayodhya, thereby opening pathways for broader economic prosperity.\nThe report further highlighted rapid employment growth across hospitality, construction, transport and services. Around 6,000 micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) have been newly set up or revived in and around Ayodhya. Over the next four to five years, tourism expansion is expected to generate approximately 1.2 lakh direct and indirect jobs.\nSmall retailers and street vendors report daily earnings rising from Rs 400–500 earlier to as much as Rs 2,500. Real estate prices near the temple precinct have risen five to ten times, attracting investors from across India.\nBetween February 2020 and February 2025, the Ram Temple Trust remitted around Rs 400 crore in taxes, including approximately Rs 270 crore in GST, indicating growing formalisation and compliance, the authors noted.\nDaily footfall of over two lakh pilgrims has sustained demand for hospitality and allied services. More than 150 new hotels and homestays have opened in the city. Major hotel chains, including Taj Hotels, Marriott International and Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, have announced expansion plans in Ayodhya.\nOnline travel platforms have reported up to fourfold growth in bookings. Tour operators said that pilgrims are increasingly combining visits to Ayodhya with trips to Varanasi, indicating the emergence of a broader spiritual tourism circuit.\nProfessor Saddikuti said that the Ram temple is shaping India’s emerging “temple economy\" playbook, comparable to redevelopment-led tourism growth seen around Kashi Vishwanath Temple and Mahakaleshwar Temple.\n“If connectivity, crowd management and last-mile services keep pace, Ayodhya can anchor a multi-city spiritual tourism circuit with measurable economic spillovers,\" he said.\nUnder the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the leadership of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, the temple-led development framework has gained academic validation, the report noted.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "The National Green Tribunal (NGT) recently cleared the Rs 80,000-crore Great Nicobar Island mega infrastructure project, stating there were “adequate safeguards\" in place.\nThe tribunal’s special six-member bench, headed by Chairperson Justice Prakash Shrivastava, refused to interfere with the environmental clearance (EC) originally granted in November 2022, citing the project’s strategic national importance.\nThe NGT’s decision followed a report from a High-Powered Committee (HPC), which was formed in 2023 to address earlier deficiencies in the clearance process.\nThe project, spearheaded by the Andaman and Nicobar Islands Integrated Development Corporation (ANIIDCO), includes an International Container Transshipment Terminal (ICTT), a greenfield international airport, a power plant, and a township.\nThe Great Nicobar Island (GNI) project, officially known as the ‘Holistic Development of Great Nicobar Island’, aims to transform India’s southernmost island into a major global maritime and strategic hub.\nThe project spans 166 sq km (about 10% of the island) and includes four primary pillars:\nInternational Container Transshipment Terminal (ICTT): Located at Galathea Bay, this deep-sea port is the centerpiece. It aims to capture global trade passing through the Malacca Strait, reducing India’s reliance on foreign ports like Colombo and Singapore.\nGreenfield International Airport: A dual-use facility for both civilian tourism and military logistics, capable of handling wide-body aircraft.\nIntegrated Township: Designed to support a future population of over 3.5 lakh people, up from the current 8,000.\nGas & Solar Power Plant: A 450-MVA hybrid plant to provide energy self-sufficiency for the new infrastructure.\nThe island is just 40 nautical miles from one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, Malacca Strait, where 40% of global trade passes. It serves as India’s “first line of defence,\" providing a forward base to monitor naval movements in the Indo-Pacific, particularly countering regional influence from other powers. Currently, 75% of India’s transshipment cargo is handled outside the country. This project aims to bring that revenue and logistical control back to India.\nThe project is being implemented in phases, with the first phase of the port targeted for completion by 2028.\nThe tribunal on February 16 emphasised a “balanced approach,\" ruling that the project’s significance for national security and trade near the Malacca Strait outweighed the grounds for halting it.\nRelying on Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) findings, the NGT noted no major reefs are in the direct project footprint but mandated the translocation of approximately 16,000 coral colonies found nearby. Directives were issued to ensure no loss of sandy beaches, which are critical nesting grounds for the Leatherback sea turtle and the Nicobar megapode.\nThe tribunal concluded that the project does not fall within prohibited Island Coastal Regulation Zone (ICRZ-IA) areas, dismissing petitioners’ claims of regulatory violations.\nThe NGT noted that the government must adhere to welfare conditions for the Shompen (a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group) and Nicobarese communities, though local leaders have alleged coercion in land surrender.\nWhile the NGT has disposed of environmental clearance challenges, the project remains under scrutiny:\nCalcutta High Court: Forest clearance for the project is still being argued.\nEnvironmentalists and political figures, including Jairam Ramesh, have termed the ruling “deeply disappointing,\" warning of “disastrous ecological impacts\" such as the felling of over 10 million trees and the displacement of indigenous tribes.\nWith Agency Inputs\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "Mamata Banerjee Fact-Checked: What Bangladesh Election Data Shows On Minority Representation | Exclusive",
        "content": "Indian intelligence sources have rejected West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s recent remarks citing Bangladesh’s elections in her criticism of the Election Commission of India, saying she does not have complete data about how the neighbouring country’s polls were conducted.\nAddressing the media after polls in the neighbouring country, Banerjee had said: “The election in Bangladesh was concluded peacefully. Everybody thought there will be violence. But it was done peacefully. But while India is a democratic county, its Election Commission with its ‘threat culture’, will bulldoze democracy.\"\nHowever, sources familiar with internal assessments told CNN-News18 that the picture emerging from Bangladesh’s parliamentary elections is far more complex, and troubling, particularly with regard to minority participation and representation.\n‘Deliberate Playbook’\nIntelligence inputs indicate that violence and intimidation targeting Hindus and other minorities continued for over a year, particularly in politically sensitive and border districts. Officials describe what they term a “deliberate playbook\" by certain political actors aimed at inciting anti-minority sentiment, including attacks and pressure tactics designed to discourage participation.\nIn several constituencies, especially in volatile regions such as Bagerhat and Gopalganj, rejections and withdrawals of minority candidates were reportedly higher, pointing to security concerns. Sources allege that in some pockets, minorities were “systematically pushed out of the system\" through a mix of administrative hurdles and intimidation.\nRepresentation Gap In Candidate Numbers\nData from the Bangladesh parliamentary election shows that of 2,034 candidates contesting 299 seats, only 80 were from Hindu minority backgrounds. That represents approximately 3.9 per cent of the total candidate pool, even though Hindus comprise about 8 per cent of Bangladesh’s population—effectively half their demographic share.\nIn several constituencies where Hindu voters account for 15-20 per cent of the electorate, major political parties reportedly did not nominate Hindu candidates.\nMany Hindu aspirants are said to have filed nominations in significant numbers, including in minority-heavy constituencies such as Khulna-1, where eight Hindu nominees initially entered the race. However, some nomination papers were rejected on multiple grounds, while others were allegedly withdrawn under pressure.\nMost of the 80 Hindu candidates were fielded by smaller leftist parties with limited vote share. Only two to three Hindu candidates are believed to have won seats, all on tickets from the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). No major mainstream party is seen to have significantly exceeded proportional representation for Hindu candidates.\nWar Of Words\nBanerjee’s comments, suggesting that India should look at how Bangladesh conducted its polls, sparked immediate backlash from the BJP and drew a firm response from the Election Commission, which defended the country’s electoral processes.\nIntelligence sources now argue that selective comparisons overlook ground realities in Bangladesh, including minority underrepresentation and reported intimidation.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "Mumbai’s newly opened melody road on the Coastal Road is facing backlash just two days after its inauguration. Residents of Breach Candy have written to Municipal Commissioner Bhushan Gagrani, calling the constant musical vibrations a major disturbance. A copy of the complaint has also been sent to the Maharashtra Chief Minister’s Office.\nThe local residents’ forum, representing over 650 families, said the tune plays daily from 6am to midnight, adding to the existing traffic noise. They have demanded that the BMC discontinue the musical stretch. The civic body is yet to respond.\nThe musical stretch is designed to play the tune ‘Jai Ho’ when vehicles strike precision rumble strips at the correct speed. It was meant to reward safe driving. However, residents in nearby densely populated neighbourhoods say it has become a constant disturbance.\nIn their letter, the Breach Candy ALM and the Breach Candy Residents Forum said the amplified sound enters homes as a constant, muffled but intrusive background noise. Many residents are keeping windows shut. Senior citizens have reportedly expressed serious discomfort.\nResidents said the northbound side of the road is meant for fast-moving traffic. They argue that drivers are getting distracted by listening to the music instead of focusing on the road. Some drivers are slowing down suddenly to hear the tune, which could lead to high-speed crashes or pile-ups.\nThe community said Mumbai already faces constant horn-honking and engine noise. They believe adding amplified music is unnecessary and worsens the noise problem.\nThey also pointed out that the music plays near schools and hospitals, where peace and quiet are important for health and learning. The letter said residents are increasingly fatigued from raising serious civic concerns while avoidable and non-essential interventions receive attention. It added that the deafening noise from speeding supercars on the Coastal Road remains unaddressed.\nResidents have urged the civic administration to immediately review and discontinue the music initiative, calling it disruptive to daily life in the neighbourhood.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "Assam Congress president Gaurav Gogoi on Wednesday launched a sharp attack on former state Congress chief Bhupen Borah, questioning his decision to move towards the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) soon after resigning from the party and alleging that recent developments have validated long-standing suspicions within the Congress about internal information leaks.\nReacting to Borah’s statements and his impending entry into the BJP, Gogoi said Congress leaders had earlier been troubled by how confidential discussions within the party were allegedly reaching individuals close to Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma.\n“We always wondered how confidential details of our meetings were leaked to a particular journalist linked to Himanta Biswa Sarma. We tried our best not to believe in these rumours and speculation, but now these rumours have come to light, and it is true,\" Gogoi said.\nHe further accused Borah of quickly aligning with the BJP leadership after stepping down from the Congress, saying the timing of the move has raised serious political questions.\n“A day after leaving the Congress party, Bhupen Borah has no qualms about joining the BJP and surrendering to Himanta Biswa Sarma. Why, within a day of resignation, did you join Himanta Biswa Sarma?\" Gogoi asked.\nGogoi also dismissed Borah’s criticism of the Congress as a justification for switching sides.\n“All of this is just an excuse to join the BJP. When someone joins the BJP, they are given a script, and they have to read that script,\" he said.\nGogoi added that people across Assam were questioning Borah’s decision to join the BJP instead of another opposition party if he was dissatisfied within the Congress.\n“The people of Assam are thinking that if you are facing difficulties in the Congress party, then why don’t you join some other party that is fighting against the BJP? There are other parties too that are fighting against the BJP. Why did you shake hands with Himanta Biswa Sarma within just one day of resigning?\" he said.\nThe political row comes after Borah resigned from Congress earlier this week, triggering a major churn in Assam politics.\nBorah claimed that the state Congress unit is no longer functioning under Gogoi’s effective leadership and alleged that Dhubri MP Rakibul Hussain has become the party’s “sole base\", while describing Gogoi as merely the “face of the party\".\nBorah also said that the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, spoke to him at length after he submitted his resignation letter, recalling their long political association.\nSenior Congress leaders, including the party’s central leadership, had reached out to persuade him to reconsider his decision, though Borah maintained that he needed time to reflect after more than three decades in the party.\nMeanwhile, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma announced that Borah would formally join the BJP on February 22 after meeting him at his residence, publicly welcoming the former Congress leader and stating that the BJP’s doors remain open to him.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "A man walking along the roadside in Perampalli village in Karnataka’s Udupi was run over by a crane in broad daylight. The accident took place in front of the Herga Agricultural Service Cooperative Society. The pedestrian sustained serious injuries and was rushed to a nearby private hospital for treatment.\nAccording to preliminary reports, the crane driver allegedly swerved the vehicle to avoid an oncoming car and, in the process, ran over the man walking alone along the roadside. The horrific incident was captured on CCTV.\nIn the video, the man can be seen coming under the vehicles of the crane. The footage shows the driver halting his vehicle for a brief moment after the man was run over but he soon resumed his journey without checking on the man. A few moments later, the pedestrian managed to regain his senses, visibly struggling to get up. It is to be noted that the vehicle was moving in a moderate speed when the accident occurred.\nThe driver reportedly fled the scene immediately after the accident. So far, no arrests have been made as\nauthorities continue to examine the footage to trace the driver.\nCrane Crushes Man To Death In Rajasthan\nEarlier in January, an elderly farmer, Kailash Gurjar (56), was crushed to death by a speeding crane on the service road of the Jaipur-Agra National Highway in Dausa, Rajasthan. According to police, Gurjar was walking home from Manpur Chauraha Market when the crane hit him from behind, and its wheels ran over his body. He was declared dead on the spot. The driver fled, and authorities launched a search based on a complaint filed by Gurjar’s son.\nResidents in both areas have raised concerns over the reckless operation of cranes and other heavy vehicles. Along busy service roads and near industrial units, large vehicles frequently move at high speeds, posing serious risks to pedestrians. Locals have demanded stricter enforcement of traffic rules and accountability for drivers of such heavy machinery to prevent any untoward incident in the future.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "Big technology events are often seen as a stage to show what the future looks like. Universities, startups and companies bring their latest ideas in a hope to impress experts and policymakers.  That is what happened at the India AI Impact Summit 2026 in Delhi where Galgotias University found itself in the middle of a debate.\nGovernment sources said on Wednesday, February 18, that the university had been asked to vacate the expo venue immediately. The move came after questions were raised about a robotic dog displayed at the summit.\nWhat Sparked Galgotias University’s Robotic Dog Controversy?\nThe issue began when a robotic dog named “ORION\" was presented at the summit. A video showed a faculty member demonstrating the robot which caught widespread attention online. Soon after, social media users claimed that the device looked exactly like the Unitree Go2, a commercially available robotic dog made by a Chinese company.\nThis led to accusations that the university was presenting an imported product as its own innovation. The controversy grew because the display was linked to the university’s larger Rs 350 crore AI ecosystem investment.\nHow Did The University Respond?\nAs the debate picked up pace online, the university issued a clarification. It said that it had never “claimed\" to have built the robotic dog. According to the statement, the device was purchased from China-based Unitree for academic purposes and student learning.\n“The recently acquired robodog from Unitree is one such step in that journey. It is not merely a machine on display; it is a classroom in motion. Our students are experimenting with it, testing its limits and, in the process, expanding their own knowledge. Let us be clear: Galgotias has not built this robodog, nor have we ever claimed to. Let us be clear – Galgotias has not built this robodog, neither have we claimed. But what we are building are minds that will soon design, engineer, and manufacture such technologies right here in Bharat,\" the statement read which was shared by the university’s official X (formerly Twitter) handle.\npic.twitter.com/cgBbhld876— Galgotias University (@GalgotiasGU) February 17, 2026\nWhat Were The Broader Criticisms?\nThe controversy did not remain limited to just the robot.

According to him, security personnel began clearing the exhibition area around noon to sanitise the venue ahead of the Prime Minister’s scheduled visit.\nYadav said that he tried to explain that NeoSapien had developed what he described as India’s first patented AI wearable, capable of tracking conversations and analysing emotions, and requested permission to stay back briefly to showcase it.\n“Day 1 of the AI Impact Summit turned to be a pain for us. At 12 noon, security personnel arrived to sanitise and cordon off the area ahead of the visit by PM Modi visit at 2pm. I explained that we’re building India’s first patented AI wearable at NeoSapien and requested a chance to showcase it,\" he said in a post on X.\nWhile one officer initially allowed him to remain, he alleged that another security team later instructed all exhibitors to vacate the area immediately.\nHe said that he specifically asked whether he should carry the wearable devices along, but was told that even laptops were being left behind and that security would ensure the safety of items kept inside the booths.\n“Trusting them, I left,\" Yadav wrote, adding that the exhibition zone remained sealed for nearly six hours. When access was restored, he claimed the AI wearables were missing. He later shared images on social media showing empty boxes at the NeoSapien stall.\nHe questioned that how the theft could have taken place when, according to him, only security personnel were allowed inside the exhibition zone at the time.\n“If only security and official entourage had access, how did this happen? This is extremely disappointing,\" he added.\nMeanwhile, Union Electronics and IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Tuesday issued a formal apology for logistical challenges and overcrowding that marked the opening day of the summit. Addressing a press conference at Bharat Mandapam, he attributed the disruptions to an “unprecedented\" surge in attendance, with more than 70,000 people arriving at the venue on the first day alone.\nVaishnaw said registrations for the five-day event have crossed 300,000 and acknowledged that “pockets of confusion\" emerged due to the scale of participation and security arrangements for the Prime Minister’s inauguration. He said a dedicated war room has since been set up to streamline operations and prevent further inconvenience to exhibitors and delegates.\nThe India AI Impact Summit, being held at Bharat Mandapam, is among the most high-profile technology events hosted in the country this year.

Therefore, we want AI’s benefits to be diffused to everyone and not just hoarded by early adopters,\" he said.\nHe further said that as the first global AI summit hosted in the Global South, India is creating a platform that amplifies under-represented voices and development priorities.\nHighlighting India’s priorities, PM Modi said AI governance, inclusive datasets, climate applications, agricultural productivity, public health and multilingual access are central to the country’s approach.\n“Our vision is clear: AI must accelerate global development while remaining deeply human-centric,\" he said.\nIndia is hosting the AI Impact Summit 2026 at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi from February 16-20, bringing together global policymakers, technology leaders and AI innovators. The event marks the first major global AI summit to be held in the Global South. Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the India AI Impact Expo on Monday.\nThe summit, which features over 300 pavilions and delegates from 60 countries, continues to host high-profile discussions on responsible AI, sovereign models like BharatGen, and the inevitable role of AI in national defence.\nThe summit, positioned as one of the world’s largest gatherings dedicated to artificial intelligence, initially struggled to cope with the sheer scale of global interest. With total registrations already surpassing 300,000, the first day saw long queues and significant delays at entry points. Participants, including startup founders, international delegates, and researchers, reported being stranded for hours as security protocols for VVIP movements—including the inauguration by Prime Minister Narendra Modi—clashed with the massive public footfall.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "The Delhi High Court on Tuesday ordered late industrialist Sunjay Kapur’s wife, Priya Kapur, and sister Mandhira Kapur Smith to refrain from making public statements against each other amid an escalating defamation dispute.\nWhile hearing a civil suit filed by Priya Kapur, who has accused her sister-in-law of running a continuous and defamatory campaign against her through podcasts, interviews, social media posts and other public statements, Justice Mini Pushkarna emphasised the need for dignity and decorum given the nature of the dispute, and said, “Both parties are directed to exercise restraint in making statements on each other, directly or indirectly,\" news agency PTI reported.\nThe high court also issued summons to Mandhira Kapur Smith and podcast host Pooja Chaudhri in the matter and listed the case for further hearing in May.\nIn her lawsuit, Priya Kapur alleged that within days of Sunjay Kapur’s death, his sister “embarked upon a systematic and organised course of conduct\" to malign and socially discredit her.\nAccording to the suit, the alleged defamatory statements falsely accused her of dishonesty, moral impropriety, professional incompetence, concealment of assets and illegitimate assumption of corporate control. The plea further claimed that such content was deliberately published and amplified through the podcast ‘InControversial with Pooja Chaudhri’, causing serious harm to her reputation, dignity, privacy and mental peace.\nSenior counsel appearing for Priya Kapur argued that Mandhira had uploaded and circulated content on social media with the intent to tarnish her reputation. The suit sought a permanent injunction restraining the defendants from publishing any further content against her, removal of existing material, an unconditional public apology and damages of Rs 20 crore.\nOn the other hand, counsel for Mandhira Kapur Smith told the court that there was a “concerted media vilification campaign\" against her as well.\nSunjay Kapur passed away on June 12 last year after collapsing during a polo match in England. He reportedly suffered a sudden cardiac arrest.\nPriya Kapur has also filed a criminal defamation case against Mandhira Smith before a trial court.\n(With inputs from agencies)\nLatest Blogs",
