        "content": "India’s highest telescopes are at Hanle village in Ladakh.\n| Photo Credit: R.V. Moorthy/The Hindu\nThe budget has brought some cheer to India’s research community, particularly for those involved in astronomy and space research, as it has earmarked ₹13,416.20 crore for the Department of Space for 2026-27.\nA large chunk of the allocation has been set aside for deep-space exploration and astrophysics, including to build two advanced telescope facilities: the 30-m National Large Optical-Infrared Telescope and the National Large Solar Telescope near Pangong Lake in Ladakh.\nAlso in focus is the COSMOS-2 planetarium in Amaravati, Andhra Pradesh, to be completed soon, and improving the control systems of the Himalayan Chandra Telescope in Hanle, Ladakh. Currently, only the U.S., China, Japan and the European Union prioritise astronomy research to a high degree and constantly invest large sums to upgrade their terrestrial and space telescopes. So, astronomers have said, the telescope allocations will improve space research capability and science outreach in India.\nHowever, experts also raised concerns about a significant drop in expenditure, with the actual expense falling short of budgetary estimates. This underutilisation has in the past led to bottlenecks in the planning and executing major projects.\n“There were several proposed space missions which were finally not supported,” Bhaswati Mookerjea, professor and chairperson of the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, said.\nDr. Mookerjea added that although this budget “is an extremely positive step for astronomy in India,” the importance of following it through couldn’t be overstated: “The execution of big projects in India would still require some streamlining of resources with checks and balances.”\nOnly a few large astronomical observatories are capable of frontier research and groundbreaking discoveries worldwide, which means researchers have to compete for observation time. And when funding agencies favour their own national researchers, international scientists’ access becomes increasingly restricted, and Indians are no exception.\nTo make matters worse, an astrophysicist (who didn’t wish to be identified) told this reporter that India’s problem is compounded by the attitude of bureaucrats and administrators.\n“They are close-minded regarding concepts like buying fractional time on large telescopes or missions — measures that are not only essential to foster stronger international collaborations and keep us at the forefront of astronomy research, but also serve as a stop-gap arrangement till we have our own large telescopes,” the astrophysicist said.\nFor far too long has the country relied on overseas facilities for high-resolution data and specialised equipment to do space science, including collaborative projects such as radio, optical, and space-based observations. Acquiring strong domestic capabilities in space science and astrophysics is thus imperative if India is to reduce its dependence on foreign observatories.\nBuilding large-scale, next-generation observatories for cutting-edge space research, however, involves overcoming formidable financial and technological hurdles. These challenges often require collaborative partnerships with international teams and pooling resources and expertise with them is often the only way for Indian scientists to participate in ambitious projects. Adequate funding, effective governance and partnership with domestic industry offer a realistic solution to shrug off this dependence on foreign facilities and research data.\nFortunately, India’s astronomy and space research ecosystem is being steadily strengthened with the addition of cutting-edge technology platforms. These include optical and radio telescopes, such as the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) near Pune, and data processing centres capable of AI-driven data analysis. These efforts, alongside the new budgetary push, could boost India’s research capabilities, with the growing shift towards public-private partnerships in space research adding to the optimism.\n“Basic science and big budget experiments all over the world require funding from state agencies” Dr. Mookerjea said. “While there are many private enterprises in the space sector, proper channeling of their efforts and overall quality control and monitoring would require setting up of statutory bodies involving government agencies.”\n“In the past decade or so we have seen many startups in the space sector, often working in close collaboration with Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) experts,” Abhimanyu Susobhanan, assistant professor of physics at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Thiruvananthapuram, said. “The Department of Space established the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre in 2020 to promote such partnerships. This is a positive sign as such partnerships will promote innovation and attract private investment in the space sector.”\nFor that to happen, however, policymakers should acknowledge “the imperative for strategic resource allocation and collaborative initiatives to maximise the scientific output from the country’s astronomical assets.” But, he cautioned, “we also have to keep in mind that private interests may not always align with the interests of the nation as a whole.”\nAn important upside of developing homegrown cutting-edge resources in space science is that it will encourage students to engage in advanced research in the country, arresting the steady brain drain to institutions abroad. But that has been easier said, with a lot of homework still being required before it becomes a reality. For instance, the GMRT is the world’s largest radio telescope array operating at low frequencies and attracts astronomers from across the world. But in the absence of a comparable optical telescope in the country, Indian scientists are forced to stand in line for telescope time at foreign facilities, as they do for doing research in high frequency radio astronomy.\nSimilarly, India doesn’t have any telescope that operates in the critical sub-millimeter wavelengths.\n“The sub-millimetre sky is a unique window for probing the architecture of the universe and structures within it, from the dusty sub-millimetre galaxies to the ringed nature of proto-stellar disks,” Dr. Mookerjea said. “A proposal is in the pipeline and it is also a part of the Astronomy & Astrophysics Mega Science Vision 2035.”\nOnly when such projects are realised can India’s march towards becoming a leader in space exploration gather pace.\nPrakash Chandra is a science writer.\nastronomy",

        "content": "Congress leader Partap Singh Bajwa. File\n| Photo Credit: The Hindu\nThe ruling AAP in Punjab on Sunday (February 8, 2026) slammed Congress leader Partap Singh Bajwa, accusing him of making objectionable remarks against Cabinet Minister Harbhajan Singh.\nCongress leaders, however, rejected the charge and accused the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) of attempting to twist facts and misuse the sensitive issue of Dalits for political mileage by levelling false allegations against Mr. Bajwa.\nIn a joint statement in Chandigarh, Finance Minister Harpal Singh Cheema, Forest Minister Lal Chand Kataruchak, and AAP leader Baltej Pannu alleged that the Congress party has an “anti-Dalit” mindset and asked Mr. Bajwa to apologise within 24 hours, failing which strict legal action will be taken.\nMr. Cheema said Harbhajan Singh is a personality who rose out of poverty, cleared the civil services examination through hard work, and became an excise and taxation officer. He resigned from his job to join the Aam Aadmi Party, the Finance Minister added.\n“The Aam Aadmi Party gave him respect and made him a Minister. But today, Partap Singh Bajwa used extremely derogatory words against him, which is an insult to the entire Dalit community,” Mr. Cheema claimed.\nHe alleged that all Dalit Ministers are on the Congress party’s target. Using such language against Dalits is extremely unfortunate, he said.\n“This is a big insult to the Dalit community of Punjab. It is a matter that discourages children who move ahead in their lives through hard work in Punjab,” he added.\nThe Finance Minister further alleged that many Congress leaders are “repeatedly targeting Dalits and Scheduled Caste people of Punjab and insulting them in public rallies”.\nForest Minister Kataruchakk said that this is not a new remark by Mr. Bajwa. “From time to time, he targets leaders who rise from among workers and Dalits. Earlier, too, he made many comments against Dalit leaders,” he claimed.\nAAP leader Pannu said that Mr. Bajwa's remark points to how much “hatred” Punjab Congress leaders carry in their minds about the Dalit community. “They are calling Harbhajan Singh a ‘band player’,” he said.\nDefending Mr. Bajwa, Congress leader Aruna Chaudhry said that the AAP was attempting to create controversy out of a non-issue.\nShe said the people of Punjab, including the Dalit community, are politically aware and capable of recognising genuine casteist remarks without needing AAP to act as “self-appointed defenders”.\n“AAP is rattled because Leader of Opposition Bajwa is exposing their failures and corruption both inside the Assembly and among the public. To divert attention, they are resorting to false narratives and baseless allegations,” she said in a statement.\nChairman of the Punjab Congress Scheduled Caste Cell, Kuldeep Vaid, said the AAP has crossed all limits of political decency by falsely accusing Mr. Bajwa of making a “casteist slur” against a Cabinet Minister.\nThere was no mention of any individual’s caste in Mr. Bajwa’s remarks, and AAP was deliberately misleading the public, he alleged.\n“AAP leaders seem incapable of understanding the difference between a political pun and a casteist slur. Their attempt to provoke sentiments and exploit the Dalit community for political gain is highly condemnable,” Mr. Vaid said.\nSeveral senior Congress leaders, including MLAs Vikram Chaudhry and Balwinder Singh Dhaliwal, along with Ex MLAs Pawan Kumar Adia, Santokh Singh Bhalaipur and Joginder Pal Bhoa, also came out in support of Mr. Bajwa.\nThey collectively condemned AAP’s attempt to malign his image and mislead the public.\nPunjab\n/\nIndian National Congress\n/\nAam Aadmi Party\n/\nIndia\n/\nIndia",

Stalin said on Sunday that the Union government was creating a financial crisis in a planned manner for the State, and his government had been overcoming it not only politically but also administratively, even while fulfilling the demands of government employees.\nHe was speaking at a ceremony organised by the Joint Action Council of Tamil Nadu Teachers’ Organisation and Government Employees’ Organisation (JACTTO-GEO) to thank him for considering the demands of its members.\nMr. Stalin said the Tamil Nadu Assured Pension Scheme (TAPS) was implemented at a crucial juncture when the Centre had been consistently reducing the State’s share of tax revenue and was not releasing even the allocated funds properly. Changes in the Goods and Services Tax regime had reduced the State’s tax revenue, he said.\nThe DMK government had fulfilled the long-pending demands of teachers and government employees by recognising their valuable contribution to society. A government is a synthesis of elected representatives and its employees. The Council of Ministers and the government employees are two sides of a coin. This was the path shown by former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi, whose rule was a golden period for the government employees and teachers, he said.\nMr. Stalin said the government employees play a crucial role in delivering welfare schemes formulated by the government to the people. Calling the work done by the teachers a noble service to society, he said that because of them, Tamil Nadu stands as one of the best States for education in India.\nHe said the credit for the implementation of the DMK government’s flagship schemes since 2021 goes to the government employees. The Chief Minister said the Old Pension Scheme was stopped when the AIADMK was in power. This made the hard-working government employees suffer. But the DMK government was compassionate and inclusive, he said.",

The Iyengar Committee in 1950, the NHRC in the early 2000s, the Renke Commission in 2008, and the Idate Commission (2017) have all called for a census of DNTs. Yet questions such as ‘Have you been a DNT?, Have you been nomadic or semi-nomadic? Or denotified former criminal tribe?’ have never been included in Census schedules.\nIf that is not done this time, and if the DNTs are taken for a ride again with no specific data emerging at the end of the exercise, India will alienate close to 10 crore or more people from the mainstream. The problem can be much bigger than the problem of calculating, tabulating, and making a proper list.\nThis should have been a primary question even in the household surveys. It would be of great interest to any household surveyor to account for nomadic communities. People without houses are counted as a general classification. That speaks about houseless people, but not about DNTs.\nThis exclusion has been the worst. This is a motiveless malignity, and the census has no reason to exclude them. But the Census excludes them just because it did so earlier.\nHow can the government ensure the Census is truly inclusive of DNTs?\nFirst, the census should declare that DNTs will be enumerated. That message will go around the communities across the country. Now, saying that “we will enumerate everybody, and therefore that will also include DNTs’, is like saying that “we are not doing an independent and exclusive census of the DNTs”. So that must be done. They do not need any special permission to introduce the question.\nSecondly, the technology used should be accessible. Where it is not, there must be a system for people to go to an office and declare their DNT status. Third, the Census must avoid creating a long and unmanageable list of documents, because historically, even panchayats have refused to issue birth certificates to DNTs. And the fourth, after the census gets its data on DNTs, they must quickly consult the Anthropological Survey of India and get that data verified. And this data must be open for scrutiny by scholars as far as the DNTs issue is concerned.\nThere is a resentment among many DNT communities over their misclassification into SC/ST/OBC lists when they seek a list of their own. Must the DNT classification be exclusive of these identities?\nThe question of identity is never singular. The DNT identity is not exclusive of other identities. There is intersectionality. This is a complexity in the bureaucratic process. I accept that. But that is no fault of the DNTs. We cannot tell them that we have already messed up our bureaucratic processes, and therefore, we can no longer think of you. That’s not a good justification. These processes can be improved. Fortunately, with the help of technology, multiple classifications and multiple classificatory tags can be sorted out easily.\nAmidst calls for separate quotas for DNTs, exclusive of SC, ST, and OBC identities (where they might exist), how can these reservations account for this intersectionality?\nThe demands for reservations, DNT reservations, and DNT representation in the Assembly, Panchayat or Parliament have been around for quite a while. But there are two different issues: the first is just to count the DNTs and create a factual report on who they are, where they are, and how many they are. The second question is whether they should be given reservations or not. That will depend on the results of the Census.\nThe political decisions on whether to give reservations to DNTs or not and whether it should be aligned with the SC or ST reservation, or independent, are the next step. But in the absence of credible data, no such decision can be taken at all. To fear that such a decision will have to be taken, and therefore not to do enumeration, is not a logical line of action. Let the count take place first. Governments can then decide, and the people themselves will also know whether to demand reservations or drop the demand.\nCensus 2027\n/\ntribals\n/\npopulation and census\n/\ninterview",

        "title": "Each Minister handles his responsibility, says Piyush Goyal on trade deal, Russian oil",
        "content": "Union Minister for Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal. File\n| Photo Credit: Sushil Kumar Verma\nCommerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal on Sunday (February 8, 2026) refuted any allegations of friction between him and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and that Ministers other than him did not know the contours of the agreement with the U.S., telling The Hindu in an interview that “people have mixed up two different issues”.\nIn the interview, as well as in previous press conferences, Mr. Goyal said that the Ministry of External Affairs would answer questions on whether India would be stopping its Russian oil imports, as U.S. President Donald Trump has claimed.\nOpposition parties had alleged that even Mr. Jaishankar was not answering the question, and was instead passing it on to the Commerce Minister, citing an interview Mr. Jaishankar gave during his trip to Washington.\nWatch: U.S.-India trade deal | What are the red flags? | Worldview\n“See the question to which he [Mr. Jaishankar] replied,” Mr. Goyal said in the interview. “The question was about the nuances of the trade deal. So if there’s anything about the trade deal, obviously I will reply. People have mixed up two different issues.”\n“If you ask the Agriculture Minister about the trade deal, he won’t answer,” he added. “If you ask me about what’s happening with, let’s say, the oil mission, I wouldn’t be able to respond. I would have a general idea, but I would not like to make a statement on record without full knowledge of facts. Each person handles his own responsibility.”\nIndia-U.S. trade deal: Piyush Goyal rejects claims India yielded to U.S. demands\nMr. Goyal also sought to address the concerns of the farmers unions as well, asserting that “not a single farmer had anything to worry about” as sensitive items have been excluded from the deal, while others have been dealt with through quotas, phased duty eliminations, and margins of preference.\n“Different tools have been used to protect our farmers, so I see absolutely no reason for any farmer to complain,” he said.\nExcerpts from the interview:\nWhat has been the departure in this deal from India’s previous relationship with the U.S.?\nI think it’s in continuation of our very strong and important strategic relationship. They are one of our most important partners in the world. We are both large democracies. We have shared interests in several sectors. We have a strong defence partnership. We have a strong technology partnership. We have a strong critical minerals partnership. We also are members of two Quads together, so it’s a very, very powerful relationship. The trade agreement further enhances our relationship and elevates it to a much deeper friendship.\nBut didn’t these trade issues create a knot in that relationship?\nAs much as we expand our cooperation and engagement with the world’s largest economy, a $30 trillion market that is opening up for us, I’m sure it will only be good for the country.\nWere the negotiations difficult?\nNot at all. It was just like any other negotiation. Every country has to work towards getting a fair, equitable and balanced agreement. Everybody has sensitivities, just like we have sensitivities of, let’s say, certain farm produce. They have sensitivities on certain produce on their end. Everybody ensures that you take care of your defensive interests. And clearly everybody is looking for openings, new opportunities to expand trade in a manner that the people, the businesses of both countries can benefit.\nCould you give us some insight on the behind-the-scenes process?\nI would think more work happened virtually. And that’s one of the learnings from COVID. Most negotiations happened virtually right until the end. I was here, my teams were here, and they were there. We would have phone calls of and on if the issue was small, if it was substantive we would have video conferences.\nWhat was the one issue that took time to reach an agreement on?\nI don’t think there’s any such issues, any one issue that was a road block to the agreement. It was a very smooth and very amiable dialogue in a very friendly atmosphere with a lot of fun and frolic and laughter and also intense negotiation.\nOur red line was related to agriculture…\nLargely. All of India’s sensitivities, every single one of them, have been safeguarded. The sensitivities have been protected by carefully seeing what are the products where India is self-sufficient, farmers have good production, we don’t import at present or will not be required to import, and we have excluded these from the scope of this agreement.\nSo meat is not covered, for example, except turkey. Poultry is excluded. Dairy is excluded. No GM food products are included. No concessions have been given on soybean, corn, rice, wheat, sugar, cereals, millets like jawar, bajra, raggi, kodo, amaranth, fruits like banana, strawberries, cherries, citrus fruits, pulses in which we are self-sufficient in India, like green peas, kabuli chana, moong, oil seeds, certain animal feed, ground nuts, honey, malt and its extracts, non-alcoholic beverages, flour and the meals made of flour, starch, essential oils, ethanol for fuel, and tobacco, among others.\nSo after this, the farmers have really no cause for complaint and have absolutely nothing to be worried about.\nBut some farmer groups, such as those growing cotton, are unhappy…\nThis will help cotton farmers because exports can grow leaps and bounds. We have a competitive edge in textiles compared to our competitors. Now, markets in the U.K., Europe, EFTA countries, Australia, New Zealand, so many new markets, all in the developed world, at 0% duty are going to support our textiles. In America, our reciprocal tariff of 18% is amongst the lowest among our peer group of competing economies, so effectively the demand for cotton is going to go up.\nWe do need to import the extra long staple cotton, which we don’t have in India in insufficient quantity. So, if we give them an opening in or a quota in cotton, it’s actually good for the Indian ecosystem. Exports will grow, and as exports grow, the demand for domestic cotton also grows.\nThere’s so many items where they are opening up the large U.S. market for our farm produce and processed foods to be exported. We already are a large exporter. We export $54 billion-$55 billion every year of these products. In that situation, we are now looking at how we can double that.\nSadly, the opposition parties have such a small and weak mindset that they’re trying to distort the story and misguide our innocent farmers. I want them to understand that we are opening up new opportunities in Europe, US, Australia, New Zealand.\nFurther to that, with the U.S., we have also got 0% reciprocal tariff on a large variety of agriculture products such as spices, masalas, tea, coffee and their extract, copra and coconut oil, many nuts like areca nut, Brazil nut, cashew nut, chestnut, which you make in India, fruits and vegetables like avocado bananas, guavas, mangos, kiwis, papayas, pineapples, shiitake mushrooms.\nWhat are the areas where American demands could be accommodated?\nThere are many areas, like tree nuts, for example. We have been importing pistachios for decades, right from the Congress time. There are certain things in which you don’t have in sufficient quantity and we’ve done a very calibrated opening in all of these products.\nWherever we need those products, we have opened them. Wherever we think we need to also keep a restriction, we have kept quotas. In some cases, we’re giving a margin of preference, not a full duty reduction. In some cases, it’s a phased elimination over a period of time. So, different tools have been used to protect our farmers, so I see absolutely no reason for any farmer to complain.\nOne general concern has been the commitment to buy $500 billion of US goods…\nWell, it’s an intention. And it comes out of the fact that we have a big demand for particular goods that you don’t have in India, which we have to import. For example, energy such as crude oil, LNG, LPG, we have to import, we don’t have it in sufficient quantity in India. In aircraft, we have already placed orders worth $50 billion with Boeing. In addition to that, we need engines and spare parts. Plus the airline companies tell us they’re placing more orders.\nWe’ll probably need anywhere between $80-100 billion of planes and their parts and engines in the next 5 years. On ICT products, when we give concessions to data centres and hope to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in data centres and AI and quantum computing, we will need equipment, we will need NVIDIA chips and GPUs.\nWe made an assessment and we realised that even today we are importing $300 billion of these goods from different parts of the world. A large part of it comes from geographies that are not our preferred sources.\nIs this deal concentrating our supply chain towards the US?\nThis $300 billion that we are importing right now is growing every year. We estimate that in the next 5 years, we will need $2 trillion of all of these products, which can also come from the US. I have a full intention to buy that and to diversify from our existing sources.\nThe joint statement mentions that the two countries would take “complementary actions to address non-market policies of third parties”. Is this aimed at China?\nI would not like to speculate on any one particular geography, but any country that has non-market economy practises, we have to take care against such countries that distort the market. They affect jobs, business opportunities, and investments in our country, and therefore, we work with trusted partners and America is one of our most trusted partners. We would like to engage with them on these issues in a spirit of cooperation.\nOur trade deals with some other countries involved liberalising Indian labour movement, but this one does not…\nNone of the trade deals ever deal with immigration. Trade deals have an element of people for implementing the objectives of the trade deal. So, for example, if somebody gets a contract to do the plumbing in a hotel in Switzerland, I will need to send people to do the plumbing. So trade deals only address mobility from that perspective. Even with the European Union, the deal we have provided is that if somebody goes as a student, they will get a nine month visa to be able to work there.\nEvery trade deal stands on its own legs, but bear in mind, immigration is never discussed in a trade deal. So even with the European Union, the mobility partnership is outside the trade deal. It’s a separate partnership.\nThe joint statement also had a line that says that both countries can modify their commitments if the other changes agreed upon tariffs. Did India insist on this inclusion?\nIt’s a standard WTO provision, that if any country changes the situation that exists at the type of entering into an agreement to the detriment of the other country, by which the effects of the free trade agreement don’t flow as they are intended to flow, then the other country has a right to rebalance. It’s also not that we are doing it for the first time.\nDo you think that now the older multilateral organisations, especially economic ones like the WTO are now redundant?\nNot at all. Multilateral organisations play a very important role. India respects WTO rules of trade. I believe they add value to the global order, to the rules-based global trading business. But I think we have to accept that with changing times, there will be some changes. We are actively in dialogue at the WTO to look at WTO reforms.\nThe question of great interest is on India’s policy on Russian oil…\nI don’t deal with that subject. It is not part of my joint statement or the trade deal.\nBut your colleague in the Ministry of External Affairs made a statement that he’s not dealing with that issue and that you are.\nSee the question to which he replied. The question was about the nuances of the trade deal. So if there’s anything about the trade deal, obviously I will reply. People have mixed up two different issues. If you ask the agriculture minister about the trade deal, he can’t answer. If you ask me about what’s happening with, let’s say, the oil mission, I wouldn’t be able to respond. I would have a general idea, but I would not like to make a statement on record without full knowledge of facts. Each person handles his own responsibility.\nDo you still feel that we will see the formal agreement by mid-March?\nOh yes. Unlike with other countries, where we did the framework agreement and then got down to the nitty-grities, in the U.S. case, we’ve done a full negotiation of all the issues literally line by line. So, the negotiation part is nearly complete. We’ll be able to close it quickly.\nThe joint statement came before because the reciprocal tariff has to come down to 18%. The executive order of reducing it to 18%, we hope to see next week.\nIndia-United States\n/\ntrade agreements\n/\nnational government",

It is the responsibility of the State and the Central governments to work for farmers’ welfare. Farmers are above all political affiliation,” he said here at the valedictory function of the International Trade Fair.\nHis statement came in response to State Agriculture Minister N. Cheluvarayaswamy who, pointing out at effective implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Formalisation of Micro food processing Enterprises, sought further financial assistance in different schemes for developing food parks, cold storages, transport services, branding and exports of Karnataka’s agri produce to bring better income to farmers.\nMr. Cheluvarayaswamy also said that agriculture should grow beyond politics.\nOffering a slew of helping measures from the Centre, the Union Minister said that though Karnataka is the largest producer of toor dal in the country, the average yield per hectare is less than the national average. “Under pulse mission, the Centre will offer help to increase productivity through scientific and technical support.”\nAnnouncing the setting up of 25 ‘seed villages’, he said that the Centre will particularly assist setting up of ‘seed villages’ where farmers would produce their own seeds, in the toor dal growing regions of the State.\n“The Centre will encourage FPOs, farmers’ organisations, and private sector with a financial support of ₹25 lakh each to set up 35 dal mills,” he said.\nAcknowledging that coconut production had declined owing to old or disease-afflicted coconut plantations, Mr. Chouhan said that the Coconut Development Board will encourage the planting of new high yielding varieties of coconut. Technical teams have been set up to help prevent diseases in coconut trees, and that Karnataka should utilise their services, he added.\nThe Union Minister said: “Rice varieties that could reduce labour cost, consume 20% less water and could be harvested 18 to 20 days earlier are being developed. The ICAR is developing special varieties that could suit the needs of Karnataka. The Centre will help Karnataka take its millets and processed food produce to the international market.”\nHe also said that the Centre will release ₹154 crore under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana shortly along with another ₹191 crore.\nThe Union Agriculture Minister also visited the Indian Institute of Horticulture Research here and interacted with scientists to understand research and extension activities. He also interacted with farmers and incubatees who have benenfited from IIHR technologies. He also interacted with directors of the ICAR institutes located in Bengaluru.",

He said the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh must explain their silence after the USA reportedly warned of reimposing 25% ad valorem duty if India continued to buy Russian oil, directly or indirectly.\nHe sought to know where the BJP’s nationalism was when a “white-skinned” foreign leader was issuing threats over India’s sovereign economic decisions. He claimed that India had reduced Russian oil imports while China benefited by buying cheaper crude oil.\nTurning to local issues, Mr. Owaisi said that despite Karimnagar being listed as a Smart City, basic infrastructure such as roads, drainage and electricity remained inadequate, with Muslim localities especially neglected. He also alleged that, at the behest of the local MLA, 25 houses were demolished overnight in the city.\nTaking a dig at Karimnagar legislator Gangula Kamalakar, Mr.Owaisi said the latter had retained his Assembly seat earlier only because of the AIMIM’s support.

The event was organised by the Water Resources Department and Karnataka Irrigation Corporation Limited. The flood control infrastructure will cost an estimated ₹200 crore in the first phase. The Chief Minister launched around 72 development works at the cost of ₹150 crore.\n“The third phase of the Krishna Upper River Project has been stalled by the Union government. We have urged the Union Ministers concerned to issue a gazette notification that can enable us to start work, but in vain. Similarly, the Union government is yet to provide the necessary clearances to the Kalasa Banduri Nala project. The Central Wildlife Board is yet to approve our application, though the other departments have issued clearances and the Supreme Court approved the project in 2018. If all permissions are obtained, the work can start tomorrow itself,” the Chief Minister said.\nOn the Mekedatu drinking water project, Mr. Siddarmaiah said the project involves the usage of 65 tmcft of water. But it is stuck as the Union government is yet to clear the State’s proposals. The courts have already dismissed objections filed by Tamil Nadu, he added.\n“The Upper Bhadra River project was considered a project of national importance in the Union Budget. The Centre promised to release ₹5,300 crore for the same, but no money has been released so far,’’ the Chief Minister pointed out.\n“Some people are going around saying that the Karnataka government is not taking up development works as it has exhausted resources on guarantee schemes. That is far from the truth,” Mr. Siddaramaiah stated.\nHe added that several development works are under way across the State. “For example, we have taken all necessary steps to start work on the Kalasa Banduri Nala project. Since the Supreme Court approved the project, we called and finalised tenders and fixed the agency. However, work is yet to begin as we have not received the necessary clearances from the Union government,’’ the Chief Minister said, adding that “our government has spent around ₹25,000 crore on irrigation projects since coming to power’’.\nHe said that the Union government is collecting ₹4–5 lakh crore in taxes from Karnataka, but is releasing grants of only around ₹60,000 crore. “We have raised our objections against this,’’ he noted.\nThe Chief Minister criticised the BJP-led NDA government for introducing the VB-G RAM G scheme after making several changes to the MGNREGA Act. “For two decades, this scheme provided livelihood to rural folk, reduced distress migration to cities, and ended starvation deaths,” he added.\nA look at the beneficiary statistics of MGNREGA reveals that 53% of beneficiaries were women. Out of the total beneficiaries, 28% are from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes — 17% and 11%, respectively. “The welfare scheme that aimed to provide jobs to the youth, women, and the unemployed has been abandoned. It is extremely unfortunate. However, we will not keep quiet. We will fight against this. We will fight to re-establish the MGNREGA scheme,” Mr. Siddaramaiah stated.\nHe said he is committed to making Navalgund a model constituency. “Several development works have been launched in the constituency. There are demands to build an underground drainage system in Annigeri town. It will be discussed before the Budget,” the Chief Minister noted, adding that the ₹200-crore flood prevention project was taken up at the insistence of N.H. Konaraddi, MLA.\nEarlier, an estimated cost report of ₹1,610 crore was submitted to the Union government. “But since the Centre delayed approvals, we decided to take up the first phase at a cost of ₹200 crore. Due to the flash floods in the stream, about 37 villages and 20,000 hectares of land were flooded. This will be avoided by the restraining wall and other structures,’’ the Chief Minister said.\nMr. Siddaramaiah said he is a believer in Basavanna’s ideology of “inclusive and not othering”. We are running a welfare state. We have spent around ₹1.16 lakh crore on the five guarantee schemes. About ₹54,000 crore is used annually for the guarantee project. On an average, ₹4,000–5,000 is given to every family each month, or around ₹50,000 per year in direct benefits, he said.\nMinisters H.K. Patil, Satish Jarkiholi, Santosh Lad, Prasad Abbayya, MLA, Salim Ahmed and F.H. Jakkappanavar, MLCs, leaders Shakir Sanadi and S.R. Patil, I.G. Sanadi, former MP, A.H.

Did he disclose the receipt of this fund to the Election Commission and while submitting his annual income tax returns?” Ms. George asked.\nK.P. Udayabhanu, a CPI(M) State committee member and the first to raise allegations of financial fraud against the Pathanamthitta MP, went a step further by demanding a detailed probe into alleged land transactions involving Mr. Antony in Bengaluru. He also wanted the Special Investigation Team probing the Sabarimala gold scandal to examine Mr. Antony’s financial transactions in Bengaluru.\nThe Enforcement Directorate, which is probing alleged money laundering by the non-banking financial company, too has included this aspect within the scope of its investigation.\nMr. Antony, however, declined to respond to media queries on the controversy. Earlier, he had acknowledged receiving funds from N.M. Raju, the NCS proprietor, to finance his election campaign and claimed that the amount was repaid within two months. He, however, has refused to disclose the amount actually received from this source, fuelling speculation. Mr. Raju, on the other hand, has maintained that the MP received the money without any documentation and is yet to repay the amount.",

People will be trained to identify various threats hidden in online spaces and the possible ways in which fraudulent operatives target victims. Added to this, the focus on AI awareness will help the trainees not only to get an idea of the possibilities of AI and its responsible use, but also to identify AI-generated content which is often used on online platforms to propagate fake narratives.\nThe State government had in 2024 launched the K-SMART application to make available services of local self-government bodies digitally over a uniform platform. Services including building permit applications, civil registration applications, trade licenses, and grievance redressal are now being delivered through K-SMART.\nMinister for Local Self-Governments M.B. Rajesh had said during the first phase of the project that it was part of the government’s long-term plan to equip all sections of the population with the knowledge of accessing digital services after it made available most of its services online through the K-SMART platform.\nAfter undergoing training under Digi Kerala 2.0, the trainees will be able to use K-SMART without approaching help desks or third parties.

It established a framework for managing and distributing the waters of the Indus River system, which has remained largely functional despite decades of regional conflict.\nThe treaty divides the six major rivers of the Indus basin into two groups:\nEastern Rivers (Ravi, Beas, Sutlej): Allocated to India for unrestricted use.\nWestern Rivers (Indus, Jhelum, Chenab): Allocated to Pakistan.\nIndia is permitted limited “non-consumptive\" use of these rivers for domestic, agricultural, and run-of-the-river hydroelectric power generation, provided it follows strict design specifications to avoid harming Pakistan’s interests.\nIt provides for a Permanent Indus Commission (PIC), abilateral body with a commissioner from each country tasked with data exchange, annual meetings, and initial conflict resolution. In case of disputes, it has a three-tiered mechanism starting with the PIC, followed by a Neutral Expert for technical issues, and finally an ad-hoc Court of Arbitration for major disputes.\nAs India held the IWT in abeyance, it has halted meetings of the Permanent Indus Commission and fast-tracked projects on western rivers (like Ratle and Pakal Dul) without the previously required technical notifications to Pakistan.\nIt has also rejected rulings from the Court of Arbitration, which India currently labels as “illegal.\"\nSawalkote HEP (1,856 MW): This is the first major new project to receive a “green light\" post-IWT halt. On February 5, 2026, NHPC invited international tenders worth ₹5,129 crore for its construction. It has been designated a “Project of National Importance\" and will be the largest in J&K once completed (estimated 9-year timeline).\nDulhasti Stage-II (260 MW): Approved by a Ministry of Environment panel in December 2025. This project is an extension of the existing Stage-I and was cleared specifically under the logic that IWT notification requirements are currently void.\nPakal Dul HEP (1,000 MW): Being fast-tracked for a “non-negotiable\" commissioning deadline of December 2026. Crucially, this is India’s first storage project on a western river, giving it the ability to regulate water flow timing into Pakistan.\nKiru (624 MW) & Kwar (540 MW): Both are run-of-the-river projects being accelerated. Kiru is targeted for December 2026, while Kwar is now set for March 2028.\nRatle HEP (850 MW): Long-contested by Pakistan, this project’s construction is now being treated as a sovereign decision. It is being fast-tracked for a 2028 completion.\nIndia has initiated desilting and reservoir enhancement at the Salal and Baglihar projects to improve storage and power generation, activities previously restricted by the treaty.\nSince the halt, India has reportedly restricted or fluctuated water flows from existing dams like Baglihar and Salal. In May 2025, downstream flows at Pakistan’s Marala headworks reportedly dropped by up to 90% during maintenance operations.\nIn June 2025, India initiated a feasibility study for a 113-km canal to divert surplus water from the Chenab basin in J&K toward the Ravi and Beas systems in Punjab and Rajasthan.\nWith Agency Inputs\nLatest Blogs",

The actor-turned-politician is also expected to file his nomination from Trichy East, signaling a strategic push to expand his party’s presence across key urban and regional strongholds.\nThe confirmation comes amid widespread speculation about the actor’s political debut at the state level.\nEarlier, Vijay stated that his party, the TVK, has emerged as a major political force with the backing of the people and claimed it is the only party capable of defeating the DMK in the upcoming elections.\nVijay dismissed speculations of a triangular or multi-cornered contest, stating that the true electoral battle would be a straight fight between the TVK and the ruling DMK, which he confidently predicted would face defeat.\n“People talk about triangular or four-corner contests. One is represented by the TVK backed by the people, the second is DMK, and the third is BJP and its many allies.

        "content": "BJP MLA Devyani Rana made a strong impression in her maiden speech in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly on Saturday, launching a pointed critique of the Union Territory’s budget while drawing rare applause from members of the ruling National Conference (NC).\nAs Rana rose to speak on the budget presented by Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, NC legislators were seen thumping their desks in encouragement, a gesture that was repeated at the end of her address, despite her sharp criticism of the government’s financial priorities.\nAhead of the speech, Speaker Abdul Rahim Rather urged members to support the first-time legislator, who won the recent by-election from Nagrota following the death of her father, senior political leader Davinder Singh Rana.\nDavinder Singh Rana, once a prominent NC leader and close associate of Omar Abdullah, had joined the BJP a few years ago, a move the chief minister has publicly described as one of his biggest political regrets.\nFollowing Rana’s death after the October 2024 Assembly elections, Abdullah had delivered an emotional tribute in the House, recalling their long association.\nReflecting this personal history, the NC had mounted only a symbolic contest against Devyani Rana in the Nagrota by-election, with Abdullah notably refraining from criticising her during campaigning.\nOn Friday, Abdullah, who also holds the finance portfolio, presented a Rs 1.13 lakh crore budget for Jammu and Kashmir. A day later, the House listened in near silence as Devyani Rana delivered a detailed, data-backed critique of the proposals.\nIn her 12-minute address, Rana questioned reduced allocations across several critical sectors, including disaster management, education and welfare schemes.\nShe highlighted that funding for disaster management and relief had been cut to Rs 350.76 crore from Rs 719 crore in the previous year.\nShe argued that such a reduction was particularly troubling in light of recent natural disasters.\n“This contraction comes in a year marked by unprecedented and relentless rainfall that caused severe destruction, especially in rural areas like Nagrota,\" Rana said, recalling the flash floods, landslides and cloudbursts that hit Jammu and Kashmir last August and September, claiming dozens of lives and leaving hundreds of families homeless.\nMore than 100 pilgrims were killed in landslides during the Vaishno Devi and Machail Yatra in Kishtwar.\nRana called for enhanced investment in disaster mitigation and relief, saying it should have been a central focus of the budget. She also criticised cuts in the education sector, warning of their long-term social impact.\n“If we spend Rs 193 crore less on education than last year, schools will be shut or merged. How will the child of a poor family move ahead?\" she asked.\nThe BJP legislator further flagged gaps in welfare implementation, citing the free bus service for persons with disabilities, which she said lacked vehicles equipped with disabled-friendly infrastructure.\nDespite her pointed attack on the government’s budget and policies, Rana concluded her speech to applause from both treasury and opposition benches, an unusual moment of bipartisan appreciation in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly.\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "Modi Govt Kicks Off Mega Dam Project On Chenab After Pausing Indus Treaty With Pakistan | Exclusive",
        "content": "India has started work on the mega Rs 5,129 crore worth Sawalkote Hydroelectric Project on the River Chenab in Jammu and Kashmir—the first such new project to get the green light from the Narendra Modi government after the abrogation of the Indus Water Treaty.\nNews18 has accessed the documents of the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) Limited inviting companies on February 5 to build this mega project in the Udhampur and Ramban districts of Jammu and Kashmir. The Sawalkote Hydroelectric Project, which in Stage One will see a 1,406 MW project coming up and a 450 MW project in Stage Two, is located on the Chenab River between the Baglihar Project to its upstream and the Salal Project to its downstream. This will be a “run of the river\" project.\n“Construction methodology and selection of equipment have been planned with the aim to commission the project as early as possible,\" reveal the documents accessed by News18, showing the urgency. Acting swiftly on projects of strategic significance following the suspension of the Indus Water Treaty, an expert committee of the environment ministry cleared the 1,856 MW project last October. Now, NHPC has invited bids to build it.\nThe documents say that the major construction works shall start after necessary initial mobilisation. “Available working season in a year in the project area shall be 12 months for all underground works & for surface works with full progress rate during non-monsoon period and with 50% progress rate in monsoon period.\"\nThe project could take 9 years to complete, as per the documents.\nNews18 reported last month that the Centre has issued firm directions to fast-track four major hydropower projects on the Chenab river system. Officials had been asked to commission the Pakal Dul and Kiru projects by December 2026, complete the Kwar project by March 2028, and accelerate construction on the strategically sensitive Ratle Dam.\nThe most consequential of the projects is the Pakal Dul hydropower project in Kishtwar. At 1,000 MW, it is the largest project in the Chenab basin and, at 167 metres, the highest dam in India. Crucially, it is India’s first storage project on a western river that flows into Pakistan. Built on a tributary of the Chenab, the project was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in May 2018.\nWith the Indus Waters Treaty effectively in abeyance, the Centre has now ordered that Pakal Dul be commissioned by December 2026. Once operational, it will give India the ability not just to generate power but to regulate the timing of water flows—a capability Pakistan has long viewed with concern.\nRunning parallel is the Kiru project, also located in the Kishtwar district. The Kiru Dam, rising 135 metres on the Chenab, is a run-of-the-river project, but its strategic value lies in how it fits into a chain of projects upstream and downstream.\nThe Centre has set the same December 2026 deadline for Kiru, making it clear that both projects are expected to come online together.\nThe third pillar of this push is the Kwar project, another run-of-the-river dam on the Chenab with a height of 109 metres. A major engineering milestone was achieved in January 2024 when the Chenab was successfully diverted to enable construction. That diversion was closely tracked in Pakistan. The Centre has now directed that Kwar be commissioned by March 2028, locking in a firm timeline.\nThen there is the Ratle project, perhaps the most contentious of them all. The 850 MW project involves a 133-metre-high dam on the Chenab and has been opposed by Pakistan for years, particularly over the design of its spillways. During his recent visit, the Power Minister laid the foundation stone for the dam’s concreting works, signalling that Ratle is now being fast-tracked. The Chenab was diverted through tunnels for this project in 2024, and the dam is expected to be ready by 2028.\nBeyond these headline projects, India is also moving ahead with Dulhasti Stage-2 on the Chenab. The project received clearance from the Environment Ministry’s panel last December and will come up after Dulhasti-I, which is already operational. Pakistan has recently objected to this clearance as well, arguing it was not informed—an objection India has rejected.\nThe Chenab is part of the Indus basin—Pakistan’s lifeline. Nearly three-fourths of Pakistan’s water originates from the western rivers that flow from India into Pakistan. Over 90 per cent of Pakistan’s agriculture depends on this basin, and almost the entire network of its dams and canals is built around it. In effect, nine out of ten Pakistanis rely on water that first flows through Indian territory.\nIndia has skipped all Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) proceedings following the Pahalgam attack.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "Greek Defence Minister Nikos Dendias on Saturday said India and the wider Indian subcontinent could become among Europe’s most viable partners for legal migration, as the continent grapples with an ageing population and shrinking workforce.\nSpeaking at the India-EU Forum 2026 in New Delhi, Dendias described migration as a long-standing global reality and stressed the need for Europe to design structured and balanced migration pathways to address its demographic challenges.\n“Migration is a global phenomenon. It existed in the past and will continue in the future,\" he said, adding that Europe’s population growth is “almost negative,\" creating an urgent demand for younger workers.\nAgainst this backdrop, he noted that the Indian subcontinent’s demographic profile makes it a strong candidate for legal migration partnerships.\n“With its current population structure, the subcontinent could be one of the best choices for legal migration,\" Dendias said, while noting that such frameworks must be carefully designed to ensure mutual benefits for both countries of origin and destination.\nThe Greek minister also flagged concerns over illegal migration, calling it a destabilising challenge fuelled by organised human smuggling networks.\nHe urged stronger international cooperation to counter what he described as a large-scale, profit-driven criminal activity.\nBeyond migration, Dendias reflected on the historical and cultural links between Greece and India, referencing Alexander the Great’s expedition to the region.\nHe described India as an enduring presence in Greek mythology and suggested that contemporary cooperation offers an opportunity to renew and deepen bilateral ties.\nThe inaugural India-EU Forum, organised by the Ministry of External Affairs in partnership with the Ananta Centre, concluded on Saturday after two days of discussions on trade, security, technology and geopolitics.\nHeld from February 6 to 7, the Track 1.5 forum brought together more than 200 policymakers, industry leaders and strategic experts from India and European Union member states.\nExternal Affairs Minister S Jaishankar delivered the opening address on February 6, while Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal participated in a special session the same day.

        "content": "Madhya Pradesh Tribal Affairs Minister Kunwar Vijay Shah has offered another apology for his objectionable remarks against Colonel Sofiya Qureshi amid a Supreme Court-mandated deadline for his prosecution, saying he did not intend to insult a woman officer.\nIn May last year, Shah sparked a political row for his remarks against Col Qureshi, who became one of the most prominent faces of media briefings when India launched Operation Sindoor against terror hideouts in Pakistan. In a viral video, Shah was seen referring to the woman army officer as a “sister of terrorists\".\nHis remarks were widely criticised by political leaders, and an FIR was filed against him. Speaking to reporters on Saturday, Shah said he had never intended to insult a woman officer, the armed forces or any section of society.\n“I have said this many times earlier, and I am reiterating it today that I did not intend to insult any woman officer, the Indian Army or any section of society,\" he was quoted as saying by NDTV, adding that his remarks were made in a “moment of patriotic excitement\".\n“It is extremely painful for me that such a controversy arose due to a small error on my part. I believe my feelings will be seen in the right context. I have always had immense respect for the Indian Army and will continue to do so,\" he added.\nShah said maintaining “decorum and sensitivity of words\" was extremely important in the public and vowed to exercise control over his speech in the future. The Madhya Pradesh High Court had ordered the police to file an FIR against him last year for the controversial remarks.\nSupreme Court Raps MP Govt For Delay\nOn January 19, the Supreme Court pulled up the Madhya Pradesh government to he delay in granting permission to prosecute Shah for his remarks. The bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) Surya Kant, Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Joymalya Bagchi directed the state government to take a call on the grant of sanction to prosecute Shah.\n“You are sitting over the SIT report since August 19, 2025. The statute casts an obligation on you and you must take a call. It is January 19 now,\" CJI Kant remarked.\nOn July 28, 2025, the top court had pulled up Shah for not placing a public apology over his remarks on record against Col Qureshi, saying he was “testing the court’s patience\". It had pointed out that the minister’s conduct was prompting it to doubt his intentions and bonafide.\nThe FIR was registered against Shah under sections 152, 196(1)(b) and 197(1)(c) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS). Since the top court’s view last month, the Congress has demanded Shah’s resignation from the Madhya Pradesh cabinet.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal on Saturday credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “masterclass\" and US President Donald Trump’s leadership in securing a landmark India-US trade deal, emphasising that the two countries share a good relationship and mutual respect.\nSpeaking in an exclusive interview with CNN-News18, Goyal said it was PM Modi and Trump’s leadership that gave impetus to the trade deal and helped smooth engagement between the two sides. “If your intent is pure, if you believe in fair play on both sides and respect each other’s sensitivities, and are committed to the well-being of your nation while recognising strengths, it leads to mutual understanding,\" he said.\nHe called the deal a powerful “win-win\" arrangement for both countries to strengthen trade engagement. “When we look at the $30 trillion US economy and the $4 trillion Indian economy that is rapidly growing to become a $30 trillion economy in 2047, we both collectively provide a force multiplier, which helps us achieve the target of $500 billion purchases in five years,\" he said.\nHis remarks came after an interim deal between India and the US was announced on Saturday, culminating months of negotiations amid tariff-related tensions. The deal provides for a reduction in reciprocal US tariffs on Indian goods to 18 per cent.\nPM Modi’s ‘Masterclass’\nGoyal further lauded PM Modi, calling him a “pragmatic leader\" who recognises India’s comparative strengths and the sensitive areas, such as farmers and fishermen. “This unique and clear understanding of PM Modi has helped us navigate the whole process,\" he added.\nHe compared PM Modi to a “masterclass\" who is very practical and offers real-life solutions. “Over the last 12 years of working with him, we have all actually grown in terms of our understanding of principles of negotiation, and our understanding of how to look at the best interests of your nation. Most important is his holistic thinking,\" he told CNN-News18.\nThe Commerce Minister said India’s focus is on acquiring ICT products, data centres and quantum computing equipment from the US to become an international player in modern-day technological areas.\nIndia-US Ties\nHe also asserted that India shares a good relationship with the United States, who respected each other’s sensitive areas. He also rejected criticism that the deal could affect Indian farmers, adding that several Indian exports are facing zero tariffs.\nHe also said he foresaw no problems with the US in the future, citing the friendly relations between the two sides and the fact that teams had finalised all matters after months of negotiations. “We are not that much apart in terms of our abilities to conclude a good deal. We are not competitors, we complement each other. We respect each other’s sensitivities. Both leaders guided teams,\" he added.\nHe said India was already self-sufficient in rice, wheat, sugar, soyabean, corn, GM products, poultry, millets, certain fruits and green peas, groundnuts and non-alcoholic beverages. These products that were sensitive for the farmers and were protected under the new deal. “On other products, there has been a calibrated opening. In many cases, there has been some phasing out over a period of time and tariff rate quotas have been given.\"\nGoyal expressed confidence that the trade deal could generate several opportunities for collaboration between the two countries.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "India is examining a proposal to mandate pharmaceutical companies to set aside a share of their profits for free medicines during health emergencies, News18 learned.\nThe proposal seeks an amendment to the Drugs Rules, 1945, to include a mandatory provision requiring pharmaceutical companies to spend “at least one per cent of their net profit for providing free medicines in medicine bank\" to be used by the central government during “health emergencies, disaster or any other circumstances considered necessary\".\nThe proposal is still under deliberation and has been placed before the country’s top statutory decision-making body on technical matters related to drugs and cosmetics, the Drugs Technical Advisory Board.\nThe move, according to the agenda document accessed by News18, is being examined to assess whether emergency access to free medicines can be strengthened through regulatory changes without conflicting with company law.\nThe proposal was deliberated at DTAB’s 90th meeting held on January 25, 2024, after which the board recommended that the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare may seek the opinion of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs on the matter.\nSubsequently, comments were received from the corporate affairs ministry, which flagged legal constraints. The agenda document notes that “the broad framework for CSR is laid down under Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013\", along with Schedule VII of the Act and the Companies (CSR Policy) Rules, 2014.\nIt further clarifies that “the Government does not issue specific direction or intervention in the manner or geographical area in which companies choose to spend their CSR funds\", highlighting limits on directing CSR expenditure through sector-specific rules.\nThe corporate affairs ministry has indicated that any attempt to mandate CSR-linked spending through drug regulations would need to be legally aligned with company law. The document states that “CSR is governed by Companies Act, 2013,\" and therefore suggests that “the authority for CSR activity may be quoted from Schedule VII, Companies Act, 2013 and Companies (CSR Policy) Rules, 2014 and proposed amendment in Drugs Rules, 1945 need to be in sync\".\nMore significantly, it cautions that “any amendment in the CSR framework would require an amendment to the Companies Act\", suggesting that changes through the Drugs Rules alone may not be sufficient.\nThe matter has now been placed back before DTAB, with the agenda concluding that “DTAB may kindly deliberate and give its recommendations in the matter\".\nThe matter continues to be reviewed, with regulators weighing public health needs against existing corporate law provisions.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "What began as a promise of guaranteed rentals and glossy commercial returns has now landed the promoters of Gurugram’s “32nd Milestone\" project in a Delhi courtroom, with a magistrate seeking a detailed police response to allegations of cheating, fund diversion, and large-scale financial irregularities.\nA Judicial Magistrate First Class at Saket Courts has issued notice on an application seeking registration of an FIR and a slew of stringent measures against the promoters and entities behind the commercial project, including freezing of bank accounts, a forensic audit of finances, suspension of passports, and issuance of Look Out Circulars. The order was passed on February 5 by JMFC Devanshi Janmeja, directing the police to file an Action Taken Report (ATR). The matter is scheduled for further hearing on March 13.\nThe application has been moved by investor Arvind Gupta, who has accused the promoters of financial misconduct, cheating, and siphoning of investors’ funds. Action has been sought against M/s 32nd Vistas Private Limited, Growth Hospitality LLP, and their promoters, including Dhruv Dutt Sharma, Shirin Sharma, Mamta Sharma, and others.\nAccording to the complaint, the investor had purchased a commercial unit in the project after being assured that the unit would be demarcated shortly. The promoters allegedly offered guaranteed lease rentals for a period of 30 years, along with a buyback option at any stage if the investor chose to exit. A leasing arrangement was subsequently executed, under which the unit was placed on a long-term lease with assurances of regular monthly rental income.\nHowever, the complaint alleges that lease rental payments stopped from August 2025 onwards. It further claims that the promoters failed to deposit Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) from September 2024 and defaulted on GST dues, statutory filings, and employee-related contributions such as ESI and PF, allegedly causing losses to investors, employees, and the public exchequer.\nThe complainant has alleged that investors were repeatedly told that rental payments and TDS deposits had already been credited but were not reflecting due to “technical issues\", claims that later turned out to be false. It is further alleged that fabricated TDS certificates were circulated among investors to create the impression that statutory deposits had been made, despite no such entries appearing in official records.\nWhen the investor sought demarcation and possession of the purchased unit or invoked the buyback option, the promoters allegedly expressed their inability to hand over possession. The application suggests that one possible reason could be multiple sales of the same commercial units.\nSerious allegations of diversion and siphoning of funds have also been raised. The plea claims that despite earning rental income from operational restaurants and commercial establishments at the project, the promoters failed to clear dues owed to investors, employees, financial institutions, and statutory authorities. It is also alleged that substantial borrowings were raised from banks and private investors and were misused.\nThe application further states that protests have been taking place outside the project premises, offices have allegedly been shut, and essential utilities such as electricity and water supply disconnected due to non-payment of dues, while the promoters are claimed to be untraceable.\nConcerns have also been raised regarding alleged expenditure on promotional campaigns and high-profile endorsements. The plea refers to associations involving public figures such as Malaika Arora, Abhay Deol, Karan Johar, Manish Malhotra, and Akshay Kumar, and seeks investigation into the financial trail of such promotional spending at a time when investor dues allegedly remain unpaid. No allegations have been levelled against these celebrities, and the plea confines itself to examining the source of funds used for such promotions.\nOn these grounds, the application seeks registration of an FIR, attachment of assets, forensic audit of accounts, suspension of passports of the promoters, and issuance of Look Out Circulars to prevent them from leaving the country.\nTaking note of the allegations, the Saket court has directed the police to submit a detailed status report and listed the matter for further consideration on March 13.\nThe company has said in a statement that recent delays in rental payments have been driven by a short-term vacancy in a limited portion of its Gurugram property, arising from normal tenant churn and a change in tenancy, and that “replacement leasing is already underway and being prioritised\".\nNotably, the legal action in Delhi follows recent FIRs registered by Gurugram Police against the owner and certain officials associated with “32nd Avenue\", the popular retail and entertainment hub, after investor protests.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "Delhi Police’s vigilance unit has registered a case following an internal inquiry into a November 2023 police operation carried out in Mizoram. The case was registered after an inquiry concluded that there was prima facie material suggesting procedural and jurisdictional irregularities during the operation.\nAccording to the FIR, the case has been filed under Sections 166, 341, 342, and 409 of the Indian Penal Code to allow a formal criminal investigation into the conduct of officers involved against IPS Shankar Choudhary, a 2011 batch officer, along with others.\nThe inquiry examined a cross-state police action conducted between November 21 and 30 in 2023 by a Delhi Police team in Mizoram in connection with a narcotics investigation. The FIR records that the team stayed and conducted operations outside Delhi’s territorial jurisdiction and that questions were later raised by Mizoram authorities about authorisation and custody procedures.\nThe document talks about an unauthorised stay and operations without lawful written orders from a competent authority.\nThe inquiry reviewed CCTV footage, travel records, PCR logs, and witness accounts to reconstruct the events.\nAccording to the FIR, the vigilance inquiry found sufficient preliminary material to justify criminal registration, so the matter could be independently investigated.\n“These observations constitute prima facie material for registration of a case to enable fair and independent investigation,\" the report states. “The purpose of the present registration is to enable a fair and independent investigation into the circumstances of the operation.\"\nThe FIR names IPS officer Shankar Choudhary as part of the raiding team whose conduct is under review.\nThe document records, “Shankar Choudhary IPS… was part of the raiding team which stayed and conducted operations in Mizoram during the period under inquiry.\"\nOn authorisation, the inquiry notes, “The officer stayed in Mizoram and continued operational activity without obtaining written permission from the competent authority.\"\nThe report also raises concerns over detention procedures: “Illegal detention… demonstrates that Harrison House premises were taken under control and individuals were confined without lawful authority.\"\nInvestigators further recorded, “No proper documentation of seizure, custody or inter-state coordination was found at the time of inquiry.\"\nAccording to the FIR, the Delhi Police officials only provided assistance in conducting the raid under the bona fide impression that the Mizoram Police team, led by a senior police officer who earlier served as DCP/Dwarka, was carrying out the investigation legally.\n“The onus was on Mizoram Police to comply with the procedural safeguard, prepare all necessary documentation related to search, seizure and arrest/detention including case diaries,\" the FIR says.\nIt further states that the role of Delhi Police officials was limited to making an entry whenever the staff moved with Mizoram Police and a detainee was brought to the police station or Anti-Narcotic Squad of Dwarka/South West.\n“Upon holistic examination of the facts, evidence, and testimonies, the following findings emerge: Shankar Choudhary, IPS, acted beyond his legal and territorial authority. He conducted unauthorised raids and seizures within Delhi, violating legal and administrative protocols. He kept a suspect, Harrison, in illegal custody for four days at Mizoram House. He failed to document seized property, thereby violating legal, procedural and evidentiary norms. Delhi Police Officials (HC Shalju, HC Vikash, HC Prashant) accompanied the officer and participated in raids without requisite sanction. Their actions, while irregular, do not establish mens rea or criminal culpability but warrant departmental action,\" the report says.\nRecommendations were made to book Shankar Choudhary for abusing authority, wrongful confinement, and misappropriation of seized property.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Friday told the Parliament that the Indian government is closely monitoring the ongoing situation in Iran after a wave of protests triggered by economic stagnation, and its embassy in Tehran was in regular touch with Indian nationals.\n“The Government is closely monitoring the situation in Iran. The Embassy of India in Tehran is in regular contact with Indian nationals, including students, in Iran, and is providing them regular advice,\" he said in the Parliament. “The Embassy continues to assist, advise, and guide Indian citizens as required.\"\n“The Government does not currently view Indian nationals in Iran as stranded, given that Iranian airspace remains open and there is regular air connectivity between Iran and India and with the countries in the region. A special evacuation has therefore not been arranged by the Government so far. The Government continues to assess the situation as circumstances evolve,\" he also said.\nHe also informed the House that there were 9,000-10,000 Indian nationals across 16 provinces in Iran, mainly students (and their families), workers, pilgrims, tourists, business persons and seafarers. “Since Iranian airspace remains open as on date, Indian nationals wishing to leave Iran have been advised to do so using available means, including commercial flights,\" he said.\nHe also highlighted a telephonic conversation with his Iranian counterpart Abbas Araghchi, where they discussed the evolving situation in and around Iran. He also reaffirmed that India remains in touch with various interlocutors regarding the situation.\nThis came against the backdrop of the Iranian authorities’ deadly response to anti-government protests that began in late December and continued through last month, in which thousands of people were killed and tens of thousands arrested, prompting military threats from US President Donald Trump.\nThis came against the backdrop of the Iranian authorities’ deadly response to anti-government protests that began in late December and continued through last month, in which thousands of people were killed and tens of thousands arrested, prompting military threats from US President Donald Trump.\nRecently, in the Budget 2026 unveiled on February 1, India earmarked zero funds for the Chabahar port in Iran despite the landmark 10-year agreement signed in 2024 for India to operate the Shahid Beheshti terminal. Analysts suggest this withdrawal is a precautionary response to the renewed geopolitical friction involving the United States.\nFurthermore, Trump has also asserted that India will buy Venezuelan oil instead of Iranian crude, signalling a possible shift in global energy trade flows. However, India said it will prioritise its own energy needs and remains open to all crude deals.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "In a major institutional reform aimed at transforming urban mobility in the national capital, the Delhi government has initiated the process of drafting a comprehensive Bill for the creation of the Delhi Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (DUMTA) along with a dedicated Delhi Urban Transport Fund (DUTF).\nThe proposed legislation seeks to rationalise, integrate and coordinate Delhi’s presently fragmented transport ecosystem under a single, coherent planning and governance framework.\nThe move marks a significant milestone in the government’s vision to create a modern, efficient, people-centric and environmentally sustainable transport system for the Capital.\nTo fast-track and ensure inclusive drafting of the proposed law, the Chief Minister has set up a high-level task force chaired by the Chief Secretary to prepare and submit the draft Bill at the earliest. The move reflects the government’s urgency and responds to long-standing demands from experts and civic stakeholders for a unified transport authority to coordinate planning, investment and operations, a press statement said.\nRecognising that Delhi’s rapid urbanisation, rising population and mounting vehicular pressure demands systemic solutions rather than piecemeal interventions, the Chief Minister has taken a proactive step by setting the legislative process in motion.\nThe task force includes senior officials from key departments and representatives of major civic and transport bodies such as DDA, MCD, DMRC, DTC, NCRTC and Indian Railways. The Chief Minister has also proposed co-opting leading urban transport experts to integrate global best practices with local needs.\nExplaining the rationale behind the initiative, Chief Minister Rekha Gupta noted that Delhi’s transport agencies have historically functioned in silos, with limited coordination in route planning, infrastructure development and service delivery.\n“DUMTA will bring cohesion to Delhi’s entire urban mobility system. By placing all modes of transport like metro, buses, regional rail, railways and feeder services, within a single planning jurisdiction, we will ensure that mobility solutions are integrated, efficient and citizen-focused,\" the CM said.\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "Weight Loss Drug Semaglutide Boom Pushes India To Consider Defining Biological Medicines",
        "content": "India is moving to formally define ‘biological drugs’ under its medicines law, as the category expands with the launch of some of the world’s top-selling therapies, including anti-obesity and diabetes blockbuster semaglutide, News18 learnt.\nThe move comes as drug regulators grapple with fast-evolving manufacturing technologies that blur the lines between synthetic medicines and biologically derived products, often produced within the same facility. The Drugs Technical Advisory Board (DTAB) is now set to deliberate on a proposal that seeks to introduce a legal definition of biological products, mandate origin-based labelling, and update legacy schedules under the Drugs Rules, 1945, to reflect modern biologics.\nThe matter has now been formally placed before the apex drug approval panel, Drugs Technical Advisory Board, with the agenda document concluding that “DTAB may kindly deliberate and give its recommendation in the matter.\"\nIf approved, industry experts believe the changes would mark a significant overhaul of India’s biological drug regulation, bringing long-overdue legal clarity at a time when biologics and peptide-based therapies are rapidly reshaping the pharmaceutical landscape. The move is also significant considering India itself is planning to become hub of biological and biosimilar drug making with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announcing the “BioShakti Pharma Hub\" scheme in the union budget last Sunday.\nAccording to the agenda document accessed by News18, the proposal has been triggered by a growing number of applications received by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation, where manufacturers are seeking regulatory approval to produce both synthetic and recombinant products at the same site. The document said that “CDSCO receives multiple applications wherein manufacturers seek permission to manufacture synthetic and r-DNA origin drug products in the same manufacturing facility.\"\nRegulatory agency in the document noted that this convergence has become especially prominent in peptide-based therapies. “Certain peptide-based therapeutic products, such as Semaglutide and similar products are available in both synthetic and r-DNA origin and in injectable as well as oral dosage forms,\" the agenda paper says, underlining the regulatory complexity such products pose.\nWhile the existing framework allows limited flexibility, the regulator acknowledges that the rules lack clarity on core definitions. “Schedule M of the Drugs Rules, 1945 provides provision for campaign-based manufacturing with appropriate cleaning validation and risk mitigation measures,\" the document said but adds that “the substantive provisions of the Drugs Rules do not define ‘Biological drugs’.\"\nThe absence of a formal definition has also created uncertainty around licensing, particularly when different categories of drugs are produced at the same location. The agenda paper flags that “currently, there are no provisions on licensing overlap between facilities licensed under Form 28 and Form 28D at the same site,\" raising concerns about regulatory oversight, inspections and compliance.\nTo address these gaps, the proposal recommends incorporating a definition of “biological products\" into both the Drugs Rules and the New Drugs and Clinical Trials (NDCT) Rules, 2019. Citing global standards, it reproduces the World Health Organization’s definition, describing biological products as “a product containing a substance produced by or extracted from biological sources, such as living cells or organisms, and which require complex manufacturing processes and control.\"\nThe document further clarifies that “biological products include vaccines, blood and blood components, allergenic, somatic cells gene therapies, tissues, recombinant therapeutic proteins and monoclonal antibodies.\"\nIn a move aimed at improving transparency, the regulator has also proposed mandatory origin-based labelling. The agenda note states that “mandatory labelling provisions may be introduced to clearly indicate the origin of the drug as ‘Synthetic Origin,’ ‘r-DNA Origin,’ ‘Human Origin,’ or ‘Animal Origin,’ as applicable.\"\nAdditionally, the proposal calls for “consequential amendments\" to Schedule C and Schedule C1 of the Drugs Rules, 1945, to explicitly include biological-origin products in both parenteral and non-parenteral forms, reflecting the growing diversity of modern biological therapies.\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "'Ego-Driven Killing': How Overseas Gangsters Orchestrated AAP Leader's ‘Remote Control’ Murder",
        "content": "The killing of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Lucky Oberoi has once again exposed the growing challenge posed by overseas-based criminal networks directing violence in Punjab from thousands of kilometres away. CCTV visuals showed a hooded assailant shooting Oberoi at close range before fleeing the scene on a scooter, pointing to a well-planned execution rather than a spontaneous act.\nTop intelligence sources have told CNN-News18 that the murder was allegedly orchestrated by Jograj Singh, also known as Joga Pholriwal — a known gangster originally from the Jalandhar–Phulriwal belt — who is currently believed to be operating from either the United States or Canada. According to security agencies, the killing did not stem from a deep political conspiracy but was triggered by pride, online provocation, and the unchecked influence of criminals operating from abroad.\nIntelligence sources allege that a minor altercation between Oberoi and Jograj Singh escalated over social media in the days leading up to the murder. Investigators claim the online exchanges were not random and played a direct role in provoking the attack. “This was a classic case of ego-driven violence amplified through digital platforms,\" a source claimed.\nSources further revealed that Jograj Singh began his criminal journey as a small-time offender involved in intimidation, assault, and extortion-related activities in Punjab. Mounting pressure from law enforcement eventually forced him to flee the country. Once abroad, distance provided him a degree of immunity, allowing him to operate with greater confidence and reduced fear of immediate arrest.\nSecurity agencies have described the killing as a “remote control murder\" — an emerging pattern in Punjab’s crime landscape. According to Punjab Police and central intelligence agencies, overseas handlers no longer pull the trigger themselves. Instead, they use encrypted messaging apps, social media provocations, and digital payments to recruit and motivate local foot soldiers to carry out violent acts.\nJograj Singh is also said to be associated with Sonu Khatri, another gangster based overseas. Intelligence sources suggest that Khatri functions less as a street-level criminal and more as a network facilitator. Agencies believe his role includes connecting overseas gangsters with local shooters, arranging logistics, and routing money through informal channels to finance murders.\nThe Oberoi killing, intelligence sources warn, underscores a dangerous trend where digital reach and transnational criminal networks are turning minor disputes into deadly outcomes, posing a growing challenge for Indian law enforcement agencies.\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "A Farmer, A Megaphone And His Radish Harvest Outside A Govt Office In Karnataka",
        "content": "On a recent morning in Tumakuru district, visitors to the Madhugiri taluk office were met with an unusual sight. A farmer stood outside the building with a megaphone, speaking calmly but firmly about a problem that, he said, had gone unresolved for months.\nBeside him was a scooter loaded not with files or placards, but with freshly harvested radish.\nThe farmer, Prasanna Kumar from Dodderi Jakkenahalli village, said he has been seeking a proper connecting road to his agricultural land. According to him, the absence of a motorable access road has made it difficult to transport produce and carry out routine farming work.\nPrasanna told officials and onlookers that he had repeatedly approached the local administration for help. Over time, the issue moved beyond the village level and reached higher authorities.\nOrders Issued, But No Action on Ground\nAccording to Prasanna, the matter was taken up with the Lokayukta, which directed officials to resolve the issue within a month. He also said he approached senior political leaders, including the chief minister and the revenue minister, following which letters were issued asking the local administration to act.\nDespite these directions, Prasanna claimed no work had begun even after nearly two months. The lack of progress, he said, pushed him to stage a public protest.\nAllegation of Bribe Demand\nStanding outside the taluk office, Prasanna alleged that officials linked to the village administration and revenue department demanded money to move the file forward. He accused the village accountant and panchayat-level revenue inspectors of seeking a bribe.\n“I don’t have cash to pay,\" he said through the megaphone, explaining why he chose to bring radish from his field. His message was symbolic: if money was the obstacle, he was willing to offer what he had grown instead.\nThe Radish Protest Goes Viral\nVideos and photographs of the farmer’s protest, radish stacked on a scooter and slogans amplified through a megaphone quickly spread on social media. The visuals drew widespread attention, with many users interpreting the protest as a reflection of frustration with bureaucratic delays and alleged corruption.\nFollowing the online attention, senior officials responded. Gotur Shivappa, assistant commissioner of Madhugiri, said he had instructed the tahsildar to look into the farmer’s complaint on priority.\nOfficials Deny Bribery Allegations\nRevenue officials, however, rejected the farmer’s claims. Srinivas, the current tahsildar of Madhugiri, said the issue was not administrative delay but a family dispute.\nAccording to him, a previous tahsildar had already arranged for an eight-foot-wide road, and an existing asphalted road already provided access to the land. Officials also said they had visited the village and that the remaining disagreement involved relatives and an adjacent plot.\nWhile the farmer maintains that official inaction and alleged bribe demands forced him to protest publicly, authorities insist the road issue has largely been addressed and that the conflict is personal rather than procedural.\nWith the matter now under scrutiny and senior officials involved, attention has shifted to what action follows and whether the farmer’s access road will finally move from paper to ground.\nThe farmer, Prasanna Kumar from Dodderi Jakkenahalli village, said he has been seeking a proper connecting road to his agricultural land.

        "content": "The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed a petition filed by Jan Suraaj, the political party led by poll strategist-turned-politician Prashant Kishor, challenging the outcome of the Bihar Assembly elections held in November last year.\nRefusing to entertain the plea, a bench headed by Chief Justice Surya Kant made sharp remarks on the party’s electoral defeat, saying, “The people rejected you and now you are using this judicial platform to gain publicity?\"\nJustice Joymalya Bagchi also questioned the maintainability of the petition, asking Jan Suraaj’s counsel how such claims could be raised directly before the apex court.\nThe bench declined to hear the matter under Article 32 and asked the petitioner to approach the Bihar High Court instead.\nJan Suraaj had sought to have the election results declared null and void, alleging large-scale violations of the Model Code of Conduct by the ruling Janata Dal (United)–Bharatiya Janata Party alliance.\nThe party argued that the state government’s decision to disburse Rs 10,000 to one woman per family during the election period compromised the fairness of the polls.\nAccording to the petition, the benefit was extended to an estimated 25–35 lakh women voters while the Model Code was in force, amounting to “corrupt practices\" by the ruling coalition.\nKishor had earlier claimed that the JD(U) distributed crores of rupees per constituency and said the party should not have won more than 25 seats under normal circumstances.\nIn the election, however, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) emerged as the largest party, winning 85 seats, far exceeding both its 2015 tally and Kishor’s own predictions.\nThe Supreme Court noted that the broader issue of election freebies is already under its consideration in a separate case.\nIn earlier observations, the court had warned that competitive promises of financial benefits could push states towards fiscal distress and has referred the issue to a three-judge bench.\nOn Friday, the court said it was serious about examining the matter but would prefer petitions from “public-spirited\" individuals rather than parties that had suffered a complete electoral defeat.\nJan Suraaj’s challenge follows a disappointing electoral debut for the party, which contested 238 seats but failed to win a single constituency, ending with a vote share of under four per cent.\nKishor, who had previously engineered successful campaigns for both the BJP and JD(U), had predicted a decisive outcome for his party, either a major breakthrough or total failure.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "The Madras High Court on Friday dismissed a petition filed by actor and Tamilaga Vetri Kazhagam (TVK) founder Vijay, who had challenged a Rs 1.5 crore penalty imposed by the Income Tax Department.\nJustice Senthilkumar Ramamoorty rejected the plea and upheld the demand notice issued by the department. The penalty relates to the assessment year 2015–16 and concerns alleged non-disclosure of income.\nAccording to the tax authorities, documents seized during a 2015 search at Vijay’s residence indicated that he had not declared Rs 15 crore earned from the film Puli. Based on these findings, the department issued an order on June 30, 2022 imposing the penalty.\nVijay, however, maintained that he had declared an income of Rs 35.42 crore for the financial year 2016–17 and challenged the department’s action in court.\nA single judge had earlier admitted his petition on August 16, 2022 and granted interim relief by staying the operation of the penalty order.\nWith Friday’s ruling, the High Court has now dismissed his challenge and allowed the tax department’s action to stand.\nVijay argued that the penalty order ought to have been issued before June 30, 2019 and claimed that the delay made it invalid. The Income Tax Department, however, maintained that the action was lawful under the provisions of the Income Tax Act and urged the court to reject his petition.\nAfter considering both sides, the court agreed with the department’s stand and dismissed Vijay’s plea.\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "Delhi To Launch Double-Decker Tourist Buses For Key Heritage Sites Soon | Check Routes And Fares",
        "content": "The national capital is gearing up to introduce a new sightseeing experience for visitors with the launch of double-decker tourist buses later this month. The initiative, led by the Delhi government, will link major heritage and cultural landmarks through a specially designed tourism circuit across the heart of the city.\nSenior officials said the service, likely to start in February, is being developed primarily for domestic and foreign tourists, with a strong focus on the central vista and nearby national monuments. The aim is to make some of Delhi’s most prominent attractions easier to access through a single, organised route.\nMajor Heritage Sites To Be Linked Via This Service\nThe planned circuit will include destinations such as the Pradhanmantri Sangrahalaya, National War Memorial, Bharat Mandapam, the new Parliament complex, Kartavya Path and Dilli Haat. Officials said the project seeks to present these landmarks as part of a unified tourism experience rather than isolated sites.\nThe use of double-decker buses is expected to enhance sightseeing, with elevated seating offering wider views of monuments and ceremonial avenues. Authorities believe this format will provide a more engaging and relaxed way for visitors to explore the city.\nIn addition to daytime operations, the tourism department is also working on evening sightseeing services. While the night-tour route has largely been finalised, details on operating hours are yet to be announced.\nAn electric double-decker bus, along with two other buses, is expected to begin service around February 20, coinciding with the first anniversary of the Delhi government. The electric vehicle has been supplied by a private firm under a corporate social responsibility initiative. Originally housed at the Okhla depot under the transport department, the bus has now been transferred to the tourism department.\nCheck Fares\nAccording to officials, the service will operate from the Pradhanmantri Sangrahalaya and cover several major landmarks along the route. The fare has been fixed at Rs 500 for adults and Rs 300 for children aged between six and twelve years, news agency PTI reported.\nA guide will be on board to brief passengers about the historical and cultural significance of each location. Information on booking procedures and schedules will be released ahead of the official launch.\nDouble-decker buses were once a familiar sight on Delhi’s roads, run by the Delhi Transport Corporation under the name “Suvidha\", before they were discontinued in 1989 following the gradual withdrawal of the ageing fleet.\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "Roads, Mining, Hydel Projects Claimed Nearly 1 Lakh Hectares Of India's Forest Land Since 2020",
        "content": "Nearly 97,050 hectares of forest land was diverted for non-forestry purposes in the last five financial years, starting 2020-21, the Union Environment Ministry told Parliament. Madhya Pradesh accounted for the largest share, with 902 such proposals for non-forestry use approved and only six rejected between 1st April 2020 and 31st March 2025.\nThe government said that it gave the go-ahead to as many as 10,026 proposals during this period and rejected just 120 proposals—an overwhelmingly high approval rate, with only a handful of rejections. Some regions, like the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, where 26 projects were approved, saw no rejection. Jammu and Kashmir, as well as Manipur, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram in the Northeast, also saw no rejections.\nOut of the total projects considered during the last five years, most of them were approved in Gujarat (1560), with Haryana (1424) and Uttar Pradesh (1188) following closely behind.\nRoads cut the deepest into India’s forests, with nearly 22,233 hectares of forest land diverted for construction of roads alone. Mining and quarrying followed close behind, claiming 18,913 hectares of forest land, while hydel and irrigation projects claimed 17,434 hectares, and power transmission lines nearly 13,859 hectares. Remaining diversions were mostly for Defence (6,041 hectares), railways (5,957 hectares), and other developmental projects.\nResponding to questions, Minister of State (Environment, Forests, and Climate Change) Kirti Vardhan Singh said the diversion was approved under the Van (Sanrakshan Evam Samvardhan) Adhiniyam, 1980. “The central government, following the prescribed statutory approval process, takes prompt decisions on proposals for diversion of forest land, including all development projects, that are complete in all respects,\" he told Parliament.\nAs per the conditions of approval, the states/UTs concerned have to ensure that a minimum number of trees are felled, and wherever feasible, translocation of trees is to be done, and the permission for felling of trees is given by the concerned states/UTs, he added.\nWhile Madhya Pradesh recorded the maximum diversion of forest land—24,346 hectares—it was followed by Odisha (12,875 hectares), Gujarat (6,850), and Arunachal Pradesh (6,656 hectares), as per the data from 2020-21 to 2024-25.\nThe government attributed the reduction in timelines observed in the processing of Environmental Clearance (EC) proposals to “comprehensive regulatory reforms undertaken by the Environment Ministry, supported by technology-driven interventions such as GIS layers, Decision Support System\". The minister also cited the recently launched online single-window system for processing such proposals, as well as amendments to the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006, and office memorandums issued from time to time for reducing the duration.\nThe government had also recently given appraisal powers to the State Environment Impact Assessment Authorities (SEIAAs) for sectors like mining, irrigation, and power projects, and also increased Expert Appraisal Committee meetings to at least twice a month to speed up proposal review.\nUnder the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006, project proposals are examined by an Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC), which reviews their environmental impacts. The committee recommendations are then placed before the ministry, which takes the final decision on granting or rejecting environmental clearance. Forest diversion proposals from states are reviewed by an advisory committee under the Van (Sanrakshan Evam Samvardhan Adhiniyam), 1980.\nLatest Blogs",
