File photo for representative purposes.\n| Photo Credit:\nPTI\nThe State’s interim Budget for the financial year 2026-2027 will be presented in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly on Tuesday (February 17, 2026) with Finance Minister Thangam Thennarasu presenting the State’s interim Budget ahead of the Assembly elections this year.\nThe Economic Survey of Tamil Nadu 2025-26, handed over to Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on Monday (February 16, 2026), said the State’s per capita income growth has consistently outpaced the national average. Tamil Nadu can achieve its trillion-dollar economy milestone by 2031 if it sustains the 2024-25 nominal growth rate of 16%, “with an assumption of 2% (medium-term rate) rise in the value of dollar against rupee per annum in the medium term,” it added.\nThe Finance Minister will also present in the House the demand for advance grants for the year 2026-2027 and additional expenditure for 2025-2026 for its approval, on Friday (February 20, 2026).\nFort St. George, which houses the Tamil Nadu Assembly, has been decorated with banana trees, flowers and festoons as the DMK government is ready to present it interim Budget for the election year.\nThis is the last budget of the sixth tenure of the DMK government that captured power in 1967.\nTamil Nadu government has consistently increased its expenditure on the social sector, rising from ₹1,13,268 crore in 2021-22 to ₹1,57,864 crore in 2025-26 (RE). Over time, the State has built one of India’s most extensive and innovative welfare architectures, the Survey said.\nProgrammes such as                 Naan Mudhalvan,                 Pudhumai Penn,                 Tamizh Pudhalvan, the Chief Minister’s Breakfast Scheme,                 Kalaignar Magalir Urimai Thittam, and large-scale housing and urban renewal initiatives expand capabilities, reduce household risk, and strengthen aspirations. These interventions are not merely redistributive; they stabilise consumption, sustain domestic demand, and enable workers to avoid distress-driven employment.\nThe Economic Survey 2025-26 also mentioned that Tamil Nadu’s per capita income growth has consistently outpaced the national average.\nIn 2024-25, per capita income reached ₹3.62 lakh, which is 1.77 times higher than the national average of ₹2.05 lakh, making Tamil Nadu the third-largest State in terms of per capita income.\nDespite accounting for only 4% of India’s land area and 6% of its population, the State contributed 9.4% to the national GDP in 2024-25. Its Gross State Domestic Product at current prices reached ₹31.19 lakh crore in 2024-25, reflecting a nominal growth rate of 16% and a real growth rate of 11.2% – the highest among major States.\nTamil Nadu's Economic Survey projects a trillion-dollar economy by 2031, contingent on sustained high growth rates despite potential dollar fluctuations.\nThe State’s interim Budget for the financial year 2026-2027 will be presented in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly on Tuesday (February 17, 2026) with Finance Minister Thangam Thennarasu presenting the State’s interim Budget ahead of the Assembly elections this year.\nHe will also present in the House the demand for advance grants for the year 2026-2027 and additional expenditure for 2025-2026 for its approval, on Friday (February 20, 2026).\nTamil Nadu\n/\nChennai\n/\nLive news\n/\nbudgets and budgeting\n/\neconomy, business and finance",

File photo: X/CMO Odisha via ANI\nAfter the Orissa High Court directed the State Government to complete the exercise of tallying the jewellery found from Ratna Bhandar, treasury of Shree Jagannath Temple, Puri, with the 1978 catalogue, Chief Minister Mohan Majhi-chaired high level meeting on Monday (February 16, 2026) announced to shortly inventory the precious metal.\nAs per the information presented before Odisha CM, all preparatory procedures required for the counting and inventory have been fully completed.\n“The complete repair and conservation work of both the outer and inner Ratna Bhandar has already been finished. The entire work was carried out by the Archaeological Survey of India over 95 days, involving 333 hours of work. At present, both the temple administration and the State government are fully prepared to begin the counting and inventory process,” said a statement issued by Chief Minister’s Office.\n“The Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the counting and inventory has been prepared by the Shree Jagannath Temple Managing Committee. The process will commence after receiving government approval. The entire exercise will be conducted with complete transparency under strict security arrangements,” it further said.\nThe last inventory was conducted in 1978. In the current process, the assets will be verified against the 1978 list and a final updated inventory will be prepared. The entire process will also include photography and the preparation of a digital catalogue.\nA division bench of Orissa High Court comprising Chief Justice Harish Tandon and Judge Justice M.S. Raman recently directed to complete the process of tallying and come up with inventory report within three next three months.\nAs per the last inventory carried out 45 years ago, the Ratna Bhandar had more than 1.2 quintal of gold and 2.2 quintal of silver. In addition to this, there is sizeable amount of gold ornaments which are in regular use in the temple. For obvious reasons, the State government had shown ‘reluctance’ to open the treasury of Shree Jagannath Temple.\nThe court observed that, “it is no gain saying that the inventory of the jewelleries and valuables of Lord Shri Jagannath which was conducted way back in the year 1978 shall be the bench mark document in order to ascertain the inventory undertaken by the committee subsequently constituted by the State Government, whether all the jewelleries and valuables of Lord Shri Jagannath, which were found at the time of inventory conducted in the year 1978 tallies with the inventory done by the present committee.”\nOrissa\n/\nIndia",

You mentioned Shipra but did not even reach Indore where such a huge tragedy took place in Bhagirathpura.”\nAddressing the Speaker, Mr. Singhar said that the Governor had “forgotten” about the issue of clean water. He was joined by various other Congress MLAs.\nThe LoP’s objection led to a chaotic situation in the House between the Opposition and Treasury Benches even as Mr. Patel continued to read his address. While the Congress MLAs resorted to sloganeering against the government and objected to the Governor’s address, ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLAs thumped benches in support of it.\nThe Governor only read select parts from his complete written address that is available on the Assembly’s website. After Mr. Patel proceeded from the Assembly, Speaker Narendra Singh Tomar said that the remaining parts of his address will be considered as read.\nThe tragedy in Indore’s Bhagirathpura area that began in December, 2025, has so far claimed 16 lives, as per an audit report submitted by the government authorities in the Madhya Pradesh High Court. The audit was conducted by a panel of doctors from the State-run Mahatma Gandhi Memorial (MGM) Medical College, which termed causes of at least eight deaths as inconclusive.\nHowever, local residents and media reports claim that at least 35 people have died in the lower-middle class locality of Indore. The tragedy was caused by contaminated water supplied by the BJP-ruled Indore Municipal Corporation and various government investigations have confirmed a polymicrobial infection in water and high levels of fecal coliform in it due to various sources, including mixing of sewage and drinking water in the decades-old close-running underground pipelines.\nThe Budget Session will continue until March 6 and the Budget will be presented on February 18.\nMadhya Pradesh\n/\nIndia",

Therefore, in exercise of powers under Section 13(1) of FEMA, the following penalties have been imposed by the adjudicating authority (FEMA): ₹120 crore on PPK Newsclick Studio Pvt.

Harish Rao has alleged that the Congress and BJP have proved one more time as to how far they could go for power as their unholy nexus after the elections to municipalities and municipal corporations helped them capture positions of authority such as municipal chairperson, mayor and their deputies.\nThe two parties have abandoned their ideologies, agenda and flags in the thirst for power at local bodies’ level and subverted the mandate given by the people, he said in a statement here on Monday. For the last 12 years, the Congress party called BRS the BJP’s B-team and BJP called BRS the B-team of Congress. However, the two parties exposed themselves during the elections to municipal chairperson, vice chairperson, mayor and deputy mayor positions.\nThe “fevicol bond” of Congress and BJP was on display as their common objective was to keep BRS away from holding key positions in some of the urban local bodies (ULBs), where people had voted for the latter (BRS). “While they fight in Delhi, they are shaking hands and sharing power locally. The results in Aliabad, Amangal, Metpally, Medak and Narsapur municipalities stand as clear evidence”, Mr. Harish Rao explained.\nMr. Harish Rao observed that the fear of growing public support for BRS had driven both the national parties to script the conspiracies. Even in municipalities where BRS had won the majority wards, Congress and BJP had colluded to capture chairperson posts. In Narsapur, Congress took the chairperson post and handed over the vice-chairperson post to the BJP.\nThe same pattern was seen in Sirpur-Kagaznagar and Metpally, where Congress and BJP shared chairperson and vice-chairperson posts. In Aliabad, Congress secured the chairperson post with the support of BJP’s three councillors, in Metpally, the Congress extended support to ensure that the BJP captured power, whereas in Amangal an understanding between Congress and BJP decided the outcome.\nIn municipalities such as Kathanapally, Thorrur, Jangaon and Zaheerabad too BRS had secured majority wards, but in vain due to the Congress-BJP unholy nexus.",

Speaking to The Hindu, a newly elected MP said that the EC of Bangladesh had not informed the MPs about the swearing-in of the Constitution Reform Commission. Acccording to a version, the entire parliament will work as a “Constitution Reform Commission” for 180 days as an outcome of the referendum that got majority ‘yes’ vote on February 12, 2026 and as a result all MPs will be sworn in as the member of the Constitution Reform Commission as well.

The Chief Adviser had taken charge on August 8, 2024 and he presided over the last meeting of the Advisory Council on Monday (February 16, 2026).\n“The election was not just a process to handover power. It was the election that marked the beginning of new Bangladesh,” said Prof. Yunus in a speech delivered in the evening on state-owned BTV saying that the police in Bangladesh no longer tortures common people.\n“We have to ensure that never again fascism raises its head in our country. That is why interim government prioritised institutional reforms,” said Prof. Yunus further. One of the major projects of the interim government was the drafting ofhte July Charter that was adopted by a large spectrum of political parties on October 17, 2017. The National Citizen Party which is in the opposition as part of the 11-party alliance led by Jamaat-e-Islami had not signed the Charter earlier, however, the party signed the July Charter on Monday evening (February 16, 2026). “Interim government’s biggest work is the July Charter. People have hugely supported the July Charter in the referendum. I call upon all political parties to ensure that the July Charter is adopted,” said Prof. Yunus.\nBangladesh",

Those efforts appeared to pay off on Monday, with nearly every accessible part of the sprawling 100-acre complex filled with attendees. The dozen or so panel discussion venues were left with standing room only.\nIndia AI Summit 2026 LIVE\n“We have more than 2.5 lakh registrations,” Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) Secretary S. Krishnan said on the sidelines. “We’ve tried to make all the arrangements that we can; we never anticipated that there would be so many people willing and wanting to attend, which is why we did not restrict the registrations.” The government did not provide overall attendance figures. Entry to the event is free upon registration, and visitor passes have been oversubscribed, Mr. Krishnan said.\nThe summit featured over 100 events, excluding those that were not livestreamed. In the long exhibition hall complex, over 400 booths were active, spanning industry, academia, startups, and global tech giants.\nHowever, the event was not without hitches—many attendees complained online about overcrowding, long queues at food courts, where some vendors reportedly refused digital payments. Some outlets ran out of ingredients and couldn’t restock quickly enough to meet demands. Some visitors said drinking water was difficult to access.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi during the inaugural event of AI Impact Expo 2026, at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi on February 16, 2026. Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw and  MoS Jitin Prasada also present.

One exhibitor complained online that wearable devices brought for display were stolen.  Access to several areas was also restricted later in the day, resulting in long queues at entry and exit points.\nThere were, however, some novel arrangements. A quick-commerce platform set up grocery and snack drop-off points across Bharat Mandapam, while an online food ordering and delivery company facilitated food deliveries within the complex. Digi Yatra, typically used for expedited airport entry, was piloted at entry gates, enabling attendees to use facial recognition for automated access.\nIn a post on X in the morning, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, “The AI Impact Summit will enrich global discourse on diverse aspects of AI, such as innovation, collaboration, responsible use and more. I am confident that the outcomes of the summit will help shape a future that is progressive, innovative and opportunity-driven.”\nLater in the afternoon, Mr. Modi visited the exhibition area, posting on X afterward that it was “a matter of immense pride for us that people from all over the world are coming to India for the India AI Impact Summit,” and that the “occasion is further proof that our country is progressing rapidly in the field of science and technology and is making an important contribution to global development.”\nMr. Modi is scheduled to address the plenary session on Thursday, when the event will be closed to general visitors. Keynote speakers that day include OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Microsoft president Brad Smith, and Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis.\nWhile NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang’s highly anticipated visit was cancelled over the weekend, it is unclear if there were any other cancellations. Former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates was pulled from an online speakers’ list, but officials did not respond to queries on whether Mr. Gates, who was in Amaravati earlier on Monday, would finally attend.\nArtificial Intelligence\n/\nsummit",

Mr. Dikho, from the Naga People’s Front, an alliance partner of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), speaks about the priorities of the new government.\nEdited excerpts:\nIt has been over 10 days since the swearing-in ceremony of the Chief Minister and the two Deputy CMs, including you, took place. Why is the full Cabinet not in place and why have portfolios not been allocated yet?\nThe portfolios will be allocated after the full Cabinet is expanded. I spoke to the Chief Minister, and he agreed with me.\nWhen is it expected?\nIt should not take much time. And of course, it has to be coordinated with the Centre.\nYou were the chief guest at a football match organised by the Zomi Council last week at Churachandpur. What was the outcome?\nIt was a fruitful trip. The nine tribes under the nomenclature Zomi had organised the event. I had a closed-door meeting with all the tribe leaders, the president, and all of them strongly supported the formation of the government. They invited me again for another festival on February 20.\nAfter the ethnic violence between Meitei and Kuki-Zo people erupted on May 3,2023, more than 60,000 people were displaced from their homes. What is the new government’s strategy to rehabilitate them?\nThis is a priority. Money has been distributed among the people and additional money has been provided to the displaced people who are moving back to their homes.\nThe Litan area in Ukhrul district has witnessed clashes and arson between the Kuki and Naga communities over the past two weeks? How is the situation now and what is the government’s strategy?\nThe issue is not between all Nagas and Kukis. Few members of Tangkhul Nagas and Kukis were involved. But we cannot keep silent and we intervened and involved the United Naga Council and the head of the Tangkhul tribe; we joined hands. The land dispute between the two communities should be settled and the land ownership and agreement has to be worked out. Both communities have come to an understanding and stopped the fight but till now no agreement has been signed. But it is almost under control. Naga people do not want to have these tensions any more, but the landowners have to be recognised\nThe other Deputy CM, Nemcha Kipgen, a Kuki-Zo, has not been able to travel to Imphal yet. So how is the government functioning and how are the three of you communicating?\nShe is at present at her home in Kangpokpi, and every day, we speak on the phone. She is supporting us to reach the people as she cannot come to Imphal. We do virtual video meetings. So far, two Cabinet meetings under the Chief Minister have taken place where she participated through a video call.\nWhat about the free movement of all vehicles and people from all communities on National Highway-2? It hasn’t started yet.\nI have spoken to the Deputy CM and our second plan is that we will have a Cabinet meeting in Senapati (Naga area) next. The CM told her that we will go to Senapati by road via Kangpokpi (Kuki-Zo area, NH-2 passes through here) and that we have to reach out to people. As the new government has been installed, there is a good response from all the communities. I reached out to the Thadou people in Kangpokpi, and they have invited me to attend the church on Sunday. It is a positive sign.\nManipur\n/\nstate politics",

        "content": "Bharat Rashtra Samithi cadre clash with the police and Congress cadre in Jangaon district on Monday (February 16).\n| Photo Credit: ARRANGEMENT\nElections for municipal chairperson and vice-chairperson posts turned chaotic, triggering clashes among supporters of the ruling Congress and Opposition BRS, BJP, and others in many places in the State on Monday. Ironically, the ruling Congress and its rival BJP reportedly joined hands to secure the chairperson and vice-chairperson posts through a ‘sharing system’, while BRS and Congress also reportedly entered into an understanding to grab the posts.\nOf the 112 urban local bodies — whose results of indirect elections were declared on Monday (February 16, 2026) — Congress secured 86 Chairperson or Mayor posts, followed by BRS with 18, 2 by BJP, one each by CPI and AIFB, and four by independent candidates.\nHowever, authorities postponed elections in 11 civic bodies due to disputes, protests, lack of quorum, and allegations of political interference. The postponed municipalities include Thorrur, Yellandu, Sultanabad, Ibrahimpatnam, Kagaznagar, Kyatanapalli, Khanapur, Zaheerabad, Indresham, Dornakal and Jangaon.\nHeated scenes prevailed at Thorrur town in Mahabubabad district as Warangal Congress MP Kadiyam Kavya and Palakurthi Congress MLA M. Yashaswini Reddy registered themselves as ex-officio members, which was objected to by the BRS who alleged that Dr. Kavya was an ex-officio member in the  Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation (GWMC). The dispute quickly escalated into slogan-shouting and scuffles between party cadres, forcing authorities to postpone the election to Tuesday.\nAt Ibrahimpatnam in Rangareddy district, Dornakal in Mahabubabad and Yellandu in Bhadradri-Kothagudem, elections of chairperson and vice-chairperson were deferred due to ‘lack of quorum’, as several members skipped the oath-taking ceremonies.\nElections were delayed in Sultanabad in Peddapalli district, Indresham in Sangareddy district and Kyantanpalli in Mancherial district because parties failed to finalise candidates or due to lack of quorum.\nWith both Congress, including CPM ally, and BRS tied at 13 seats each, ex-officio votes of Bhuvanagiri Congress MP Chamala Kiran Kumar Reddy and Jangaon BRS MLA Palla Rajeswara Reddy brought the tally to another 14-14 deadlock in Jangaon Municipality.\nIndependents became decisive, prompting allegations of councillor kidnapping. Police stopped vehicles of BRS councillors, triggering a heated argument between MLA Palla Rajeshwar Reddy and senior police officials. Elections were postponed amid the standoff.\nBRS senior MLA and former minister T. Harish Rao made a scathing attack on Congress and BJP, alleging that the two parties had compromised ideologies and joined hands solely to block BRS from power. He cited instances in Narsapur, Aliabad, Metpally, Amangal, and other municipalities where Congress and BJP allegedly shared chairperson and vice-chairperson posts.\nIn Aliabad of Medchal-Malkajgiri district, Congress secured the chairperson post with BJP support in the 20-member body, while Independent councillor Bandari Anusha was elected chairperson with backing from Congress, BRS, AIMIM, and independents in Adilabad.\nIn Bhainsa, independent councillor T. Dattatri won with support from the BJP, AIMIM, and Congress. In Nirmal, Congress captured power, with Appala Kavya elected chairperson and her husband Appala Ganesh as vice-chairperson.",

Out of the seven Mayor posts, three were reserved for women, and one each for the Scheduled Caste (SC) and the Scheduled Tribes (ST) categories. Among these, women held two unreserved (women) and one BC (women) mayoral seats.\nThe most striking impact of women’s participation was visible at the municipality level. Of the 116 chairpersons, 30 were in the unreserved category, 16 were in the BC, 7 were under SC, and two were in the ST categories.  Among these, at least 60 were held by women, 55 through women-reserved seats and five additional women elected in the general seats so far. This meant that women occupied more than half of all municipality chairpersonships, a rare milestone in Telangana’s civic politics.\nCombining corporations and municipalities, Telangana has 123 head posts (mayors and chairpersons). Women account for at least 63 of these, in addition to at least 11 deputy-level posts (including deputy mayors and vice-chairpersons). However, this number might increase as 11 municipalities will go for elections tomorrow.\nParty-wise in all categories, the Congress dominated the landscape with 86 head posts, followed by Bharat Rashtra Samithi with 18, the Bharatiya Janata Party (2), Independents (4), CPI (1) and AIFB (1).\nImportantly, 100% women mayor posts went to the Congress. The Congress secured mayoral posts in Mahabubnagar, Mancherial, Nalgonda, Nizamabad and Ramagundam, while the BJP won Karimnagar, and the Communist Party of India captured Kothagudem in alliance with Congress.\nYet, among these, only Congress-led corporations saw women at the top. Districts such as Nalgonda, Yadadri Bhongir, Khammam and Sangareddy reported particularly high numbers of women heading municipalities.",

        "content": "K. Ponmudy\nThe Madras High Court on Wednesday decided to hear after a fortnight a writ petition filed by former DMK Minister K. Ponmudy, who had challenged an assessment order passed by the Income Tax (I-T) department in December 2022, after coming to a conclusion that an illegal payment of ₹20 lakh had been made to him by SRS Mining owned by J. Sekar Reddy and two other partners.\nJustice C. Saravanan directed the High Court Registry to print the name of I-T department senior standing counsel A.P. Srinivas in the causelist and list the case after two weeks. The former Minister had filed the writ petition in January 2023 challenging the assessment order passed by an Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax and a consequent notice of demand issued on December 22, 2022.\nOn January 30, 2023, Justice Abdul Quddhose had passed an interim order restraining the I-T department from taking coercive steps against the former Minister until further orders from the court and granted time for the department to file its counter affidavit. The interim relief was granted after being prima facie convinced with the submissions made by senior counsel P. Wilson representing the writ petitioner.\nThe senior counsel had told the court that the I-T department had issued multiple show cause notices before passing the assessment order. While responding to those notices, the petitioner had requested the department to share with him the evidence to prove that he had received an illegal payment of ₹20 lakh from SRS Mining. However, the department was unable to share any  evidence, he claimed.\nMr. Wilson had also drawn the attention of the court to the fact that though the petitioner had requested the I-T department to permit him to cross examine the partners of SRS Mining, which had allegedly made the illegal payment to him, the department had refused to accede to his request. The denial of opportunity to cross examine the company representatives was arbitrary and illegal, he had argued.\nThe court was also told that the demand made in the show cause notices was only for a sum of ₹20 lakh but in the final assessment order, the tax liability, along with interest, had been arbitrarily increased to ₹78.33 lakh. Therefore, the petitioner urged the court to quash the assessment order as well as the consequent notice of demand issued to him by the Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax.",

        "content": "The Maharashtra government has directed the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to offer a permanent post of Class 2 officer to Asawari Jagdale, daughter of Santosh Jagdale who was killed in the Pahalgam terror attack last year.\nSources said the Chief Minister’s office called twice to speed up her appointment. Chief Minister Devendra Fadanavis was personally tracking the matter. Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde later directed the civic administration to appoint her at the earliest.\nDeputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde had earlier met the Jagdale family in Pune and assured them of government employment for Asawari. On Monday, He spoke to Pune Municipal Commissioner Naval Kishore Ram and directed that a post equivalent to her education be created. He also spoke to Asawari and said the appointment would be approved as a special matter.\nThe process to induct her into government service will be completed soon.\nThe move came after reports of financial distress and disappointment due to a delay of around 10 months in providing the government job promised on February 15.\nTwenty-six-year-old Asawari Jagdale approached the Union government seeking intervention. She said the family has been facing hardship since her father was killed by terrorists on April 22 last year. She said she left her private sector job to support her mother.\nIn a letter to the Modi government, she wrote that her family was struggling financially and was being made to run around for a job.\nAfter the attack, efforts were made to provide employment to Asawari. To avoid delays in government procedures, she was offered an option at a private university. The Chief Minister personally spoke to the university, but the family declined, said sources.\nShe was later offered a job at PMRDM, though her preference was the Pune Municipal Corporation.\nThe PMC can provide Class 3 or Class 4 posts at its level. As a special case, it sent a proposal to the state government to grant her a Class 2 post. Action on the proposal is under way.\nCongress leader Supriya Shrinate criticised the BJP government. In a post on X, she said that although the state had promised a job after Santosh Jagdale was martyred in the Pahalgam attack, it had now turned its face away.\n“Santosh Jagdale’s daughter wrote a letter to the Modi government describing the situation. In the terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Maharashtra’s Jagdale ji was martyred, the state government had promised his daughter a government job. But, as always, they have now turned their face away,\" read her post on X.\nOn November 26, 2008, during the terrorist attacks in Mumbai, Police Sub-Inspector Prakash Pandurang More was martyred while confronting terrorists. His daughter, Anushka More, was appointed on compassionate grounds.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "The India AI Impact Summit 2026 is facing multiple waves of cyber threats from foreign-based attackers prompting a serious alert across Indian security agencies.\nOwing to this, a senior cyber security officer overseeing summit operations said a G20-grade shield has been activated till the event ends on February 20.\nAccording to the authorities, one of the most serious risks is the misuse of social media and deepfake technology to manipulate or fabricate statements by world leaders, potentially spreading false narratives within minutes.\nThe authorities said cyber teams are closely monitoring online platforms to prevent disinformation campaigns linked to the summit, which was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday (February 16). As per sources, the alert states that government websites are under threat and can be targeted through “watering hole attacks\" in which hackers attempt to exploit vulnerabilities to silently plant malware.\nOfficials said summit communications also face threats from session and token hijacking, rogue “Evil Twin\" WiFi hotspots, and data theft operations aimed at delegates and affiliated social media accounts. As per the inputs, cybercriminals are simultaneously preparing ransomware attacks against critical infrastructure, while distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) strikes are intended to overwhelm digital public platforms and disrupt services.\nInvestigators suspect high-powered brute-force attempts could be executed by advanced computing capabilities, targeting network hardware such as video conferencing systems, routers and switches. Security agencies have also warned of infected USB storage devices being used to infiltrate computers and quietly spread malware across organisations.\nIn a further escalation, foreign-based threat actors are exploiting outdated or vulnerable routers used by internet service providers turning them into proxy networks to launch attacks on Indian IT infrastructure.\nA G20-grade, multi-layered, defence framework is fully operational now, with the system engineered to withstand thousands of attack attempts per minute.\nThis cyber shield includes mandatory multi-factor authentication, real-time patch management, disabled USB autorun, restricted user privileges, continuous backups and ongoing vulnerability and penetration testing audits across summit systems.\nThe umbrella system has multiple cyber security experts, teams of private players and groups of analysts. Officials indicated India’s experience hosting the G20 Summit, during which agencies neutralised more than 1.6 million cyberattack attempts without a breach. That infrastructure and operational playbook have now been expanded to safeguard the AI summit.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "A six-member special bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Monday cleared the way for the Great Nicobar Island mega infrastructure project, holding that it found “no good ground to interfere\" with the project’s Environment Clearance.\nThe Rs 80,000 crore project involves an international container transshipment terminal, an international airport, a power plant, and a township over an area of 166.10 sq km, of which 130.75 sq km is forest and 84.10 sq km tribal land.\nThe Eastern Zone Bench in Kolkata, headed by Justice Prakash Shrivastava, disposed of a batch of petitions challenging the environment clearance granted in November 2022. The NGT also directed authorities and regulatory agencies to ensure “full and strict compliance\" with the environment clearance conditions.\n“We find that adequate safeguards have been provided in the EC conditions and in the first round of litigation the Tribunal had refused to interfere in the EC and remaining issues noted by the Tribunal in the first round of litigation have been dealt with by the High-Powered Committee and considering the strategic importance of the Project and taking into account the other relevant considerations, we do not find any good ground to interfere,\" the tribunal said in its order.\n“The project is very important for India from the strategic point of view,\" the Tribunal observed, noting that development at such a location must be considered in a balanced manner while ensuring adherence to environmental regulations, including the Island Coastal Regulation Zone (ICRZ) Notification, 2019.\nThe project was accorded environmental clearance in November 2022, and in-principle forest clearance was granted in October 2022.\nThe EC was challenged on several environmental grounds. The petition had challenged environmental and Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) clearances granted to the integrated development project, alleging violations of the Island Coastal Regulation Zone (ICRZ) Notification, 2019, including alleged destruction of corals, reliance on single-season Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) data, as well as some part of the project located in the ICRZ-IA area, classified as ecologically-sensitive.\nSenior environmental activist Ashish Kothari had filed two main pleas before NGT. Kothari argued that 57 hectares of port area, 60 hectares of airport area, 81 hectares of township for defence, and 503 hectares of other township should be excluded from the project plans because they fell within ICRZ areas, where development was prohibited.\nPetitioners argued that the terms of reference given to the HPC were “truncated and factually incorrect,\" and that broader environmental issues had not been properly examined. They also sought public disclosure of the HPC’s report.\nIn 2023, the NGT had constituted a High-Powered Committee under the Union Environment Ministry Secretary to revisit certain aspects of the clearance, particularly relating to–Protection of coral colonies, Nesting sites of leatherback turtles, and Allegations that parts of the project fell within ecologically protected zones.\nHowever, the tribunal held that the committee had adequately dealt with the issues and found no error in its terms of reference. It also accepted the Union government’s submission that the HPC report contained “strategic, defence and national importance\" information and therefore could not be made public.\nOn concerns relating to coral reefs, the NGT held that no major coral reefs exist within the direct project site, as per the reports of the Zoological Survey of India and the High-Powered Committee. It also accepted the committee’s finding that one-season (non-monsoon) Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) data was sufficient for port projects, and stated that no construction falls within ecologically sensitive ICRZ-IA areas, based on the ground verification by the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM).\nIt noted that plans were underway for translocation of coral colonies as recommended by the Zoological Survey of India.\nThe Tribunal directed the Environment Ministry to prepare and approve an implementation plan for coral protection and regeneration, suggesting the involvement of scientific agencies such as the Zoological Survey of India and the National Institute of Oceanography.\nEnvironmentalists have consistently raised concerns over the project, which lies in one of India’s most ecologically fragile ecosystems, and is a key biodiversity site.\nLatest Blogs",

The probe is expected to take 10 to 15 days, as investigators review a large number of documents recovered from the operating company.\nOfficials said the findings of both the black box analysis and the DGCA inquiry will be crucial in determining the cause of the crash and the next course of action.\nPawar died in the plane crash on January 28 near Baramati in Pune district, along with Captain Sumit Kapoor, co-pilot Captain Shambhavi Pathak, Personal Security Officer Vidip Jadhav, and flight attendant Pinky Mali. The chartered Learjet 45 crashed while attempting to land at Baramati airport.\nThe Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) and the DGCA are probing the incident. Authorities have not yet released details about the cause of the crash, and officials said the investigation is ongoing.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "Cleanliness has long been one of the biggest complaints during train journeys. Now, Indian Railways is turning to Artificial Intelligence (AI) to tackle this issue more systematically and transparently.\nSpeaking to News18 India, Chief Project Engineer Lakshman Jain said that AI will now supervise cleanliness work inside trains. As part of a pilot project, AI-based cleaning monitoring has already begun in 100 trains across the country.\nRecently, Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw stated that the level of cleanliness usually seen in AC First Class coaches will now be ensured in general class coaches as well.\nLakshman Jain explained the process in detail. When cleaning staff board a train, they must first upload their photograph on a designated mobile application to mark their presence.\nBefore starting the cleaning work, the staff are required to take a photograph of the toilet and upload it on the app. After completing the cleaning, they must click another photograph and upload it again.\nOnce the images are uploaded, the AI system analyses both the ‘before’ and ‘after’ photographs to assess whether the toilet has been cleaned according to the required standards.\nIf the AI system finds that the cleaning does not meet the prescribed quality benchmarks, it can issue a warning to the concerned staff. In serious cases, it also has the authority to recommend or impose a fine.\nThrough this AI-driven monitoring mechanism, Indian Railways aims to bring greater accountability and ensure improved cleanliness standards across all classes of travel.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "A young bank employee from Haryana was found murdered late Sunday night after her throat was allegedly slit while she was travelling with her husband, prompting a police investigation into the circumstances surrounding her death.\nThe victim, identified as Mahak, was a resident of Hansi and worked at HDFC Bank in Gurugram. According to initial reports, she was travelling to Gurugram by car with her husband, Anshul, on Sunday evening when the incident occurred between Hansi and Badli. Police said the husband himself informed authorities about the killing around 11 pm on February 15.\nMahak, who was reportedly pregnant, is suspected to have been attacked on the neck with a pair of scissors. Her body was later taken to Bahadurgarh Civil Hospital for post-mortem examination. Police are currently probing the case, and her husband is being treated as the prime suspect at this stage, though officials say all angles are being examined.\nThe couple had an arranged marriage in September last year and were both working in Gurugram, with Anshul employed as a chartered accountant. On February 14, they had visited Hisar for Valentine’s Day and left for Gurugram by car at around 7 pm on Sunday. A few hours later, the incident was reported to the police.\nMahak was the youngest among three siblings. Her father, Krishna Kathuria, runs a vegetable business in Hansi’s local market. Anshul is a resident of Sector 14 in Hisar, and his father, Ramesh Dhawan, works as an accountant in the city’s cloth market. It was Anshul’s father who informed Mahak’s family about the incident late at night.\nPolice teams reached the spot soon after receiving the call and have launched an investigation to ascertain the exact sequence of events and the motive behind the killing.\nLatest Blogs",

The initiative will be formally launched in Jaipur by Union Agriculture Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Rajasthan Chief Minister Bhajanlal Sharma.\nDesigned as a round-the-clock “digital agriculture expert,\" Bharat-VISTAAR can be accessed in two modes, including via a dedicated helpline number, 155261. Its conversational AI assistant, named Bharati, will guide farmers on crop planning, recommended agricultural practices, pest management, weather updates, market prices, and government schemes. It will also provide details on eligibility, application processes, and grievance redressal, according to a report in The Indian Express.\nFarmers will be able to access information on 10 key Central schemes such as PM-KISAN, PM Fasal Bima Yojana, Soil Health Card, Kisan Credit Card, Agriculture Infrastructure Fund and PM Krishi Sinchayee Yojana, among others. Real-time alerts related to weather and pest outbreaks will also be available.\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced the initiative in the Union Budget 2026-27, allocating Rs 150 crore for its implementation in the upcoming financial year. She said the platform would integrate AgriStack portals and ICAR’s agricultural practice packages with AI systems to improve productivity, support better decision-making and reduce risks through customised advisory services.\nInitially available in Hindi and English, the platform will gradually expand to regional languages. Officials described Bharat-VISTAAR as more than just an application, calling it a “national digital backbone\" linking Central and State systems while maintaining state autonomy.

        "content": "In a major setback to the Congress ahead of the Assembly polls in Assam, former state unit chief Bhupen Kumar Borah has resigned, according to sources.\nSources said Borah sent his resignation letter to Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge. He also wrote to Rahul Gandhi.\nIn his letter, Borah said he was being ignored by the party leadership and was not given his due in the state unit. He said he had informed the high command about how the party was functioning in the state and that the situation had affected his self-esteem and dignity.\nAfter his resignation, Borah said, “I sent my resignation to the Congress High Command at 8 am this morning and explained in detail why I was compelled to take this stand. This is not a personal decision. I have given 32 years to the party and joined it in 1994. This principle is not merely personal; it is driven by concern for the party’s future. That is why I conveyed everything in detail to the Congress High Command.\"\nMeanwhile, Gaurav Gogoi has reached Bhupen Borah’s house after the latter tendered his resignation.\nBorah blamed the policies, high-handedness and favouritism of Gaurav Gogoi for his decision.\nHe was president of the Assam Congress from 2021 to 2025 and was replaced by Gogoi last year. Borah is a two-time legislator in Assam.\nHe was expected to contest from the newly formed Ranganodi constituency. He was also likely to hold talks with Opposition parties to form an alliance. However, the inclusion of MP Rockybul Hussain in the team reportedly caused discontent.\nBora, who previously served as president of the Assam Pradesh Congress Committee, has been one of the most prominent faces of the Congress in the state. His departure is widely seen as a major setback for the party’s prospects, particularly in Upper Assam, where he holds considerable influence. Political observers describe the timing of his resignation, well ahead of candidate announcements, as a calculated move that underscores growing internal dissatisfaction within the Congress ranks.\nSources indicate that Bora is likely to formally join the Bharatiya Janata Party in the coming days, potentially in the presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah. Such a high-profile induction would signal the BJP’s intent to consolidate its position further by absorbing influential leaders from the opposition camp.\nBora is expected to contest the upcoming Assembly elections from the Ranganadi constituency on a BJP ticket. The move is being viewed as a strategic recalibration, as Ranganadi is considered a politically significant seat where Bora’s personal network combined with BJP’s organizational strength could pose a formidable challenge to rivals.\nAssam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma publicly welcomed Bora’s decision, stating that the BJP’s doors are open to leaders who believe in development and strong governance. Sarma further assured that the party would extend full support to ensure Bora’s victory from Ranganadi if he joins, a clear indication that the BJP leadership has already factored him into its electoral strategy.\nWith this development, the political landscape in Assam appears poised for a fresh realignment. Bora’s exit not only weakens the Congress structurally but also reinforces the narrative of momentum shifting toward the BJP ahead of the high-stakes Assembly battle.\nLatest Blogs",

The night-long event on February 15-16, 2026, witnessed the presence of Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, who joined hundreds of thousands of seekers in celebrating what has become one of the world’s largest spiritual gatherings for Mahashivratri.\nAddressing the massive congregation, Singh drew a connection between India’s spiritual ethos and its armed forces. Referring to Operation Sindoor, he said, “On one hand, our armed forces provide humanitarian assistance during times of crisis with the spirit of Shiva. On the other, when duty demands, they execute operations like Operation Sindoor with the intensity of Rudra. The spirit within our soldiers comes from our culture, from the inspiration of Lord Shiva.\" Deeply moved by the atmosphere, he added, “The divinity I am experiencing here makes it clear, even without anyone telling me, that this place is blessed by Mahadeva, the Lord of Lords.\"\nThe evening also marked the launch of the Bhavya Bharat Bhushan Awards, instituted by Sadhguru to honour individuals shaping India’s future across diverse fields. Presenting the inaugural awards alongside the Defence Minister, Sadhguru said, “A nation is not just land; a nation is its people. Only when people are truly inspired and committed can we build a great nation – a Bhavya Bharat.\"\nThis year’s awardees reflected excellence across disciplines. In Science and Technology, honours went to Nambi Narayanan and K Radhakrishnan for advancing India’s technological frontiers. Classical dancer Alarmel Valli was recognised for preserving India’s artistic heritage, while legendary violinist N Rajam was honoured for enriching the nation’s musical landscape. Historian Vikram Sampath was awarded for illuminating India’s past through scholarship, and badminton icon Saina Nehwal for elevating India’s global sporting stature.\nA special Defence category paid tribute to Operation Sindoor, recognising senior officers representing the Air Force, Army and Navy for their service and leadership.\nBeyond the awards, Mahashivratri 2026 unfolded as a vibrant blend of meditation, music and cultural celebration under the theme “Ganga,\" highlighting the sacred river’s spiritual and ecological significance. Millions participated both in person and online. For the first time, Sadhguru performed the Yogeshwara Linga Maha Abhishekam, with over five million people registering globally for the free offering.\nReflecting on the timeless relevance of yogic sciences, Sadhguru said, “Adiyogi is not of the past. Adiyogi is of the future because what he gave are not belief systems, philosophies, ideologies or teachings, they’re technologies for wellbeing.\" He added, “Not looking up. Looking in. In is the only way out.\"\nThe event was broadcast live in 25 languages, reaching an estimated 150 million viewers worldwide. On the auspicious night, Sadhguru also announced a free Inner Engineering Online offering available until February 18 and revealed that the consecration of Kala Bhairava will take place later this year at the Isha Yoga Center.\nAs chants of “Shambho\" resonated at midnight, Mahashivratri once again stood as a testament to India’s living spiritual traditions—where devotion, culture and national service meet in a shared vision of a Bhavya Bharat.\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "AI Impact Summit Kicks Off Monday: How India Plans To Emerge As A Key Player In The Age Of AI",
        "content": "India is set to host the AI Impact Summit from February 16 to 20 at the grand Bharat Mandapam, bringing together global leaders, policymakers and industry heavyweights in Artificial Intelligence.\nFor India, the summit is not just a high-profile gathering. It is a statement of intent. New Delhi wants to signal that it does not aim to remain merely a participant in the AI revolution, but to emerge as a key architect shaping its rules, standards and opportunities.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi will address the summit, visit the Expo and engage with global CEOs. At his invitation, several world leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and Brazilian President Lula da Silva, are expected to attend.\nMinisterial delegations from over 45 countries, along with the UN Secretary General and senior international officials, will also take part in the event.\nWhy This Summit Matters\nArtificial Intelligence has moved far beyond research labs. It is reshaping healthcare delivery, transforming agriculture, recalibrating financial markets and redefining education and work. In this context, the AI Impact Summit aims to widen the global conversation.\nEarlier global meets focused strongly on AI safety and frontier risks. India is broadening the focus to highlight AI’s developmental impact — how it can drive economic growth, inclusion and sustainability. The emphasis is on “People, Planet, and Progress\".\nIndia will showcase its deep talent pool, digital public infrastructure and expanding startup ecosystem. Backed by the IndiaAI Mission’s push for compute capacity, datasets and skilling, the summit will reflect India’s strategy of balancing rapid innovation with appropriate safeguards.\nIT Secretary S Krishnan has said the key message is that AI must be human-centric and inclusive. “The key message we want to send is that whatever happens with AI needs to be human-centric and inclusive. There needs to be democratic access to AI resources, and it needs to be done in a way where people are at the centre of this process,\" he told news agency PTI.\nBig Themes To Watch\nSeven thematic working groups will present proposals on AI Commons, trusted AI tools, shared compute infrastructure and sector-specific use cases. Over 700 sessions are planned over five days, covering AI safety, governance, ethical use, data protection and sovereign AI.\nThere will be strong focus on indigenous foundation models for strategic sectors. Discussions will also explore how AI is changing industries and what new skills will be needed in the job market.\nIndia, with over 65 per cent of its population under 35, sees its young workforce as a major advantage in adapting to AI-driven industries. Reskilling and AI-focused training are likely to be key talking points.\nProminent CEOs Attending\nThe summit features a blockbuster list of global tech leaders. These include Sundar Pichai of Google, Sam Altman of OpenAI, Demis Hassabis of DeepMind Technologies, Dario Amodei of Anthropic and Brad Smith of Microsoft.\nThe presence of these influential figures places the summit at the centre of global tech deliberations. Frontier AI labs such as OpenAI and Anthropic, along with tech giants like Microsoft and Google, are expected to offer insights into the future direction of AI development.\nIndian startup founders building indigenous models will also share the stage.\nSpotlight On Sovereign AI\nAhead of the summit, 12 Indian AI startups selected under the Foundation Model Pillar presented their work to the Prime Minister. Their projects range from Indian language foundation models and multilingual tools to healthcare diagnostics, engineering simulations and generative AI applications.\nIndia’s approach is innovation-first. While acknowledging the need for regulation, the government has said it stands ready to act when required, without harming innovation.\nAs the first global AI summit hosted in the Global South, the event also aims to bring developing nations to the AI high table. A joint declaration or roadmap for responsible AI deployment could emerge as a key outcome.\n(With inputs from PTI)\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "From how to upload a Panchayat asset photo and its details to clarifying scheme guidelines, eGramSaathi, an AI-powered assistant developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, is now positioning itself as the digital bridge between village citizens and grassroots governance.\nAnd this is not a pilot project tucked away in files. It will be live on the international stage at the India AI Impact Expo 2026 in New Delhi, starting February 16. News18 reviewed the documents prepared for the summit.\nAt a time when Artificial Intelligence (AI) is often showcased through flashy consumer apps and global tech debates, the Ministry of Panchayati Raj is quietly placing AI inside the Gram Sabha, empowering India’s grassroots governance.\nThe Ministry will present a suite of AI-enabled governance tools designed specifically for decentralised administration. Alongside eGramSaathi, there is SabhaSaar, an AI system that records, transcribes and converts Gram Sabha deliberations into structured, actionable minutes of meeting, reducing paperwork and ensuring decisions don’t dissolve into memory.\nThen comes PRAMAN (Panchayati Raj Asset Monitoring and Notification), an image analytics platform that automatically validates uploaded asset photographs, checks authenticity, flags duplication and assesses quality. In a system where physical asset verification often slows schemes, automation could prove transformative.\nBut the showcase is not confined to dashboards and screens. Visitors will be able to — Be the Sarpanch — a role-based simulation placing participants inside AI-assisted decision-making scenarios. A virtual reality Gram Sabha experience, immersive walkthroughs and live demonstrations aim to show how technology can simplify complex administrative processes without displacing human agency.\nThe larger message is unmistakable here. AI in India’s public systems is not being framed merely as efficiency software, but as an accountability tool. By embedding transcription accuracy, image verification and instant citizen responses into Panchayat workflows, the Ministry is signalling that emerging technologies can strengthen transparency at the grassroots, where governance is most immediate.\nAs India hosts what is being described as a first-of-its-kind global AI summit in the Global South, the rural Ministry’s bet is clear. The future of AI will not be defined only in boardrooms, but in village meetings, asset registers and citizen queries, answered, perhaps, by a chatbot.\nLatest Blogs",

Scheduled to take place from February 16-20 at New Delhi’s ‘Bharat Mandapam,’ the summit aims to bring together policymakers, industry leaders, and technology innovators to discuss the future of AI.\nMaxim Oreshkin, deputy chief of the Kremlin staff and economic aide to President Putin, is designated to head the Russian delegation. A Kremlin source told PTI that this choice underscores a strategic effort to enhance AI collaboration between Russia and India. The delegation will focus on secure, trusted, and sovereign AI, engaging actively in discussions on AI governance, technology, and partnerships within BRICS and other international platforms, the source added.\nIn an interview to BRICS TV Network on February 9, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said: “India also emphasises ICT security, which we actively support, contributing to the agenda. This is significant, as norms regulating AI use between states, and AI applications by individual states, are only now being established.\" Lavrov said these norms will regulate behaviours that affect security.\n“Some countries are actively introducing AI into military applications. While each state has the right to determine its own approach, certain countries are already attempting to centralise control, subordinating what states can and may do with AI in the military sphere,\" he added.\nBRICS members will not accept infringements on their sovereignty, yet transparency remains crucial, the minister added.\nIndia’s Ambassador to Russia, Vinay Kumar, in an article published by the state-run news agency TASS on Friday, elaborated on the promising prospects for AI cooperation between India and Russia. He underscored the growing strategic and technological partnership, asserting that the collaboration in AI would serve as a catalyst for mutual growth and technological advancement for both nations.\nLatest Blogs",

He never allowed any poisonous or communal ideas to sway him. As a symbol of bravery, we should view Tipu Sultan as equivalent to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj,\" he added.\nAccording to ANI, the complaint said Sapkal’s remarks “hurt the sentiments of Hindus\", apparently because Tipu was a Muslim and Shivaji a Hindu, and could disturb communal harmony.\nGhate said the remarks hurt the sentiments of Hindus “who believe and consider Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as God\".\n“I don’t understand what point Harshwardhan Sapkal wants to prove by making such a statement, which hurts sentiments,\" he said.\nThe case has been registered under sections 192, 196(1), 196(2), 352 and 356(2) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.

        "title": "Devendra Fadnavis Govt To Beautify Nagpur’s Deekshabhoomi In Tribute To Ambedkar | Exclusive",
        "content": "In the heart of Nagpur stands Deekshabhoomi — not just as a monument of stone and marble, but as a living memory of a historic turning point in India’s social journey. It was here, in 1956, that Dr B. R. Ambedkar embraced Buddhism along with lakhs of followers, marking a profound moment of social assertion and spiritual transformation.\nNow, the Maharashtra government led by CM Devendra Fadnavis has embarked on an ambitious plan to redevelop and beautify the sacred precinct, with an estimated outlay of Rs 70 crore.\nThe project, to be undertaken by the Nagpur Metropolitan Region Development Authority (NMRDA), aims to transform the 58,000 square metre area into a world-class heritage landscape — while preserving its dignity, sanctity and symbolism.\nFor the millions who visit every year, especially during Dhamma Chakra Pravartan Din, Deekshabhoomi is not merely a tourist site. It is a space of reflection, identity and hope. The redevelopment plan seeks to enhance that experience. Master planning and concept design will reorganise the site to ensure smoother pilgrim movement, with clearly demarcated meditation and silence zones.\nSpecial emphasis will be placed on universal accessibility — making pathways barrier-free for the elderly, women and divyang visitors.\nSoft landscaping inspired by Buddhist philosophy will introduce meditation gardens, green buffers and indigenous tree plantations. Hardscaping elements such as plazas, paved forecourts, stone works and seating areas will be redesigned to create dignified ceremonial spaces.\nThe government also plans to install architectural and landscape lighting, energy-efficient systems, and smart illumination to enhance safety without disturbing the spiritual ambience.\nBeyond aesthetics, the project includes vital infrastructure upgrades — drainage and storm-water management, sanitation facilities, drinking water points, signage in Marathi, Hindi and English, and enhanced security systems including CCTV surveillance.\nA thoughtfully designed public address and ambient sound system will assist in crowd management during peak gatherings while maintaining acoustic sanctity.\nImportantly, interpretation zones narrating the life and philosophy of Dr Ambedkar will be developed, ensuring that younger generations understand why this ground holds such deep constitutional and cultural significance.\nOfficials insist that every intervention will be carried out in consultation with the Samaj Kalyan Department and in alignment with government policy, with “absolute respect\" for the spiritual and social ethos of the site.\nFor many visitors, the hope is simple — that Deekshabhoomi remains what it has always been: a place of dignity and quiet strength, now supported by infrastructure befitting its global stature.\nLatest Blogs",

Pawar was travelling from Mumbai to Baramati to campaign for the Zilla Parishad elections.\nMeanwhile, the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) and the DGCA are probing the incident.\nUnion Minister of State for Civil Aviation Murlidhar Mohol said on February 7 that investigators had recovered the aircraft’s black box and that its data is currently being analysed.\nAuthorities have not yet released details on the cause of the crash, and officials said the investigation is ongoing.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "Days after an Italian media report on the Air India crash, Union Minister of State for Civil Aviation Murlidhar Mohol rejected claims about the investigation into the crash in Ahmedabad last year, saying the probe is still underway.\nHis statement came after an Italian newspaper reported that Indian investigators were preparing to say in their final findings that Air India Flight 171 crashed because one of the pilots shut off the plane’s fuel controls.\nMohol denied the report and said investigation agencies are looking into the matter.\n“I just want to inform you all that our investigation agencies are probing the matter. Should we have faith in our own agencies or outsiders? Our agencies are working on it,\" he was quoted as saying by PTI on Saturday.\n“Once the final report is finalised, then only it will be justifiable to comment on it,\" he added.\nThe report in Corriere della Sera said Indian investigators were preparing to state in their final report that Air India Flight 171 crashed because one of the pilots switched off the aircraft’s fuel switches in an act that was “almost certainly\" intentional.\nIt said the claim would rely on findings that no technical fault was detected in the aircraft, suggesting the crash may have been caused by human action. The newspaper added that cockpit voice recordings, cleared of background noise, identified which pilot moved the fuel switch “from RUN to CUTOFF\".\nThe report said it was still not known whether the final findings would directly assign blame. It named the pilot, Sumeet Sabharwal, who died in the crash, as being at the centre of the matter.\nThe publication said a conclusion pointing to the flight captain would be a “desired turning point\" for US experts who have been presenting evidence to Indian authorities, as the Indian side has refused to accept a human role in the disaster.\nIt also said sound analysis clearly showed which pilot carried out the move and ruled out the possibility of an error.\nThe Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau said reports claiming that the investigation into Air India Flight AI-171 had been completed were “incorrect and speculative\".\n“The investigation is still in progress. No final conclusions have been reached,\" it said.\nThe agency referred to its preliminary report and added that the final investigation report, containing conclusions and safety recommendations, would be published after completion of the probe in line with international norms.\nIn one of India’s deadliest air accidents, 260 people, including 241 passengers, were killed when Air India’s Air India Boeing 787-8 aircraft operating flight AI171 to London crashed shortly after take-off from Ahmedabad on June 12, 2025.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "In his first remarks on the Quad Summit following the India-US trade deal developments, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Saturday clarified that the Quad summit was “never cancelled,\" pushing back against speculation about the grouping’s trajectory.\nWhile speaking at the Munich Security Conference 2026, where he participated in a roundtable discussion titled ‘Delhi Decides: Mapping India’s Policy Calculus’ hosted by Ananta Aspen, Jaishankar addressed questions regarding the Quad saying that the summit was never cancelled, however it was never specifically scheduled.\n“The Quad summit was never cancelled. It was never specifically scheduled. Yes, it did not take place — but I won’t over read ‘Quad’ not happening at a summit level,\" he said.\nJaishankar further emphasised continued engagement within the group and highlighted that his first meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio took place in the Quad Foreign Ministers’ Meeting (FMM) format.\n“We had two Quad FMMs. Other mechanisms are going on,\" he said, underlining that cooperation among the four countries remains active through multiple channels.\nDownplaying concerns over the absence of a leaders’ summit, the Union Minister signaled continuity rather than disruption in Quad engagements.\nThe Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, comprising India, the United States, Japan and Australia, has been central to Indo-Pacific cooperation on maritime security, supply chains, critical technologies and regional stability.\nJaishankar’s remarks are significant as they mark his first public statement on the QUAD following recent trade deal announcement.\nEarlier this month, US President Donald Trump announced that the United States and India have reached a trade deal to lower reciprocal tariffs. He said that following a phone call with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the US would reduce tariffs on Indian goods from 25 per cent to 18 per cent with immediate effect. In return, Trump claimed India would cut its tariffs and non-tariff barriers on US products to “zero.\"\nAs part of the understanding, India has signalled plans to increase its purchases of US products in areas such as energy, aircraft parts, machinery and technology, with an overall trade engagement target of around $500 billion over the next few years. Both sides also agreed to work on reducing trade barriers and improving cooperation on areas like digital trade and supply chains.\nLater, the White House replaced its original fact sheet on the interim trade framework with a revised version. A reference to “certain pulses\" being included in tariff reductions has been removed, ensuring that India’s longstanding tariff protections for its farmers remain intact. Similarly, wording that said India had “committed to buy\" $500 billion worth of US goods has been replaced with “intends to buy,\" making it clear that these purchases are not legally binding obligations but part of a broader intent outlined in the joint statement.\nFurther, agriculture has been removed from the list of sectors from which India would purchase US goods, limiting perceived exposure of the farm sector. The earlier line stating that India would remove its digital services tax has also been deleted. Instead, the updated version says India has “committed to negotiate a robust set of bilateral digital trade rules,\" shifting the focus from unilateral concessions to future negotiations.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "The government has rolled out PM RAHAT (Road Accident Victim Hospitalisation and Assured Treatment), a nationwide scheme designed to provide cashless medical care to road accident victims and ensure that financial constraints do not delay life-saving treatment.\nThe initiative aims to strengthen India’s emergency response system by guaranteeing immediate medical support during the critical “Golden Hour\" — the first hour after an accident, when timely intervention can significantly improve survival chances.\nUnder PM RAHAT, every eligible road accident victim will be entitled to cashless treatment of up to ₹1.5 lakh for a period of seven days from the date of the accident, regardless of the category of road on which the incident occurred.\nIn non-life-threatening cases, stabilisation treatment will be provided for up to 24 hours. In life-threatening cases, it can extend up to 48 hours, subject to verification through an integrated digital system.\nThe scheme is integrated with the Emergency Response Support System (ERSS) 112. Accident victims, Good Samaritans (Rah-Veer), or anyone present at the scene can dial 112 to receive information about the nearest designated hospital and request ambulance assistance.\nThis linkage is expected to improve coordination between emergency responders, police authorities and hospitals, helping victims reach medical facilities more quickly.\nHospitals will be reimbursed through the Motor Vehicle Accident Fund (MVAF).\nIf the offending vehicle is insured, the payment will come from contributions made by general insurance companies. In cases involving uninsured vehicles or hit-and-run incidents, the government will cover the costs through budgetary allocations.\nApproved claims will be settled within 10 days by the State Health Agency, providing financial assurance to hospitals and encouraging uninterrupted treatment.\nThe scheme operates on a digital platform that integrates the Electronic Detailed Accident Report (eDAR) system of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways with the National Health Authority’s Transaction Management System (TMS 2.0).\nThis ensures seamless digital tracking from accident reporting and police authentication to treatment delivery, claim processing and payment.\nEach district will have a designated Grievance Redressal Officer, nominated by the District Road Safety Committee, which is chaired by the District Collector or an equivalent authority, to address complaints and ensure accountability.\nIndia records a significant number of road accident deaths every year, many of which could be prevented with timely medical intervention. Studies indicate that nearly half of such fatalities can be avoided if victims receive hospital care within the Golden Hour.\nBy removing upfront payment barriers and ensuring faster emergency coordination, PM RAHAT seeks to reduce preventable deaths and strengthen the country’s emergency healthcare ecosystem.\nIn essence, the scheme ensures that accident victims receive immediate treatment without worrying about costs, a step aimed at saving lives and improving road safety outcomes nationwide.\nLatest Blogs",

It has been a time of great delivery and a time of strengthening democracy,\" the Prime Minister said.\nINDIA’S ECONOMIC RISE AND GLOBAL ROLE\nRecalling India’s economic position a decade ago, PM Modi said the country had moved steadily upward despite doubts about its trajectory.\n“When the last decade began, India was the 11th-largest economy. But today, India is rapidly becoming the third-largest economy in the world,\" he said.\nHe stressed that India would play a defining role in shaping global growth in the coming decades.\n“The century of change you are talking about, India is going to be a great foundation for it. India will drive the growth of the world. It will become a new engine for the growth of the world,\" he said.\nThe Prime Minister noted India currently contributes more than 16 per cent to global growth and expressed confidence that this contribution would continue to increase.\nNEW WORLD ORDER AND RESILIENCE\nPM Modi said the global order formed after the Second World War was transforming, as earlier assumptions about stable supply chains and uniform development models were breaking down.\n“The world is moving towards a new world order,\" he said, adding that the earlier system was based on a “one size fits all\" approach that is now losing relevance.\nHe said nations are increasingly focusing on building resilience, adding that India had adopted this vision early through the founding principles of NITI Aayog.\nFREE TRADE AGREEMENTS AND POLICY SHIFT\nThe Prime Minister said India’s free trade agreements were now widely discussed internationally, attributing the change to improved governance and clarity in policy.\n“There’s a lot of discussion these days about India’s FTAs. We are able to sign these trade deals because today’s India is full of self-confidence and ready to compete with the world,\" he said.\nHe said earlier policy uncertainty and governance challenges had weakened global confidence, but reforms had changed perceptions about India.\nREFORMS, TECHNOLOGY AND GOVERNANCE\nHighlighting reforms, PM Modi said his government had shifted policymaking towards outcomes rather than mere expenditure.\nHe described India as riding a “Reform Express,\" with technology and innovation serving as core drivers of growth. He cited the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) as a key example of reforms driven by conviction.\n“It’s not just an app; it’s a testament to the remarkable convergence of policy, process, and delivery,\" he said, adding that digital reforms had expanded financial inclusion.\nThe Prime Minister also highlighted increased capital expenditure, infrastructure investments and initiatives such as university townships, economic regions and high-speed rail corridors as steps aimed at strengthening productivity and employment.\nAI AND FUTURE PREPAREDNESS\nPM Modi underlined that artificial intelligence would bring transformative disruptions globally and said India was preparing itself for that future.\nReferring to the upcoming Global AI Impact Summit to be hosted in India, he said the gathering of world leaders and technology experts would help advance efforts toward building a better world.\nReaffirming the government’s long-term vision, PM Modi said India’s policies were guided by the goal of becoming a developed nation by 2047, stressing that decisions taken today were aimed at securing the future of coming generations.\nLatest Blogs",
