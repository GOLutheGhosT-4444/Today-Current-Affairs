        "content": "Image used for representative purpose only.\n| Photo Credit: PTi\nCongress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs on Saturday (February 28, 2026) raised concerns in the Gujarat Assembly over alleged irregularities in the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, including deletion of voters’ names.\nDuring a discussion in the State Assembly on an appropriation Bill authorising expenditure incurred in this fiscal for voter list revision, the Opposition flagged complaints about large numbers of Form 7 applications, meant for deletion of names from voter lists, being filed across constituencies without the knowledge of voters concerned.\nThe debate began after the BJP government sought passage of an appropriation Bill to regularise expenditure incurred on SIR-related work in the State.\nWhile Speaker Shankar Chaudhary had already allowed two Congress MLAs and one AAP legislator to speak on the Bill, Gujarat Forest and Environment Minister Arjun Modhwadia raised a point of order contending that matters pertaining to Election Commission of India (EC) cannot be discussed in the State Assembly.\nCiting Article 324 of the Constitution, he said the EC is an autonomous constitutional body responsible for conducting Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections and that the State government has no authority to interfere in its processes, including voter list preparation or revision.\nHe argued that while state machinery performs election-related tasks, it does so strictly under the control of ECI as per Representation of the People Act.\nIssues concerning voter list revisions, EVMs, VVPATs and related matters therefore fall outside the jurisdiction of the state government, Mr. Modhwadia said while urging the Assembly Speaker to disallow discussion on them.\nBJP MLA and former Speaker Ramanlal Vora supported the point of order, reiterating that though employees belong to the State, their election duties are carried out under direct control of EC and, hence, the Assembly was not the appropriate forum to question those processes.\nCongress and AAP members, however, opposed the move to block the discussion.\nCongress MLA Kirit Patel, however, said while the Legislative Assembly cannot question independent decisions of EC or matters pending before courts, administrative flaws where the State government bears responsibility must be open to debate.\nCongress MLA Amit Chavda said protection of the constitutional right to vote was paramount in a democracy.\n“Since the ground-level machinery from booth-level officers to election officials belongs to the state government, this House should examine errors in the preparation of electoral rolls and other administrative lapses,” he said.\nCongress MLA Shailesh Parmar claimed since funds from the State treasury were being used for SIR, the Assembly had the right to debate how the money was being spent.\nAfter hearing arguments from both sides, the Speaker, delivering his ruling, said he had reviewed past records and found that similar discussions on supplementary demands had been permitted by former Speakers.\nUnder Article 324, the ECI is autonomous and the Assembly cannot discuss its statutory and constitutional duties, including SIR exercise, he said in his ruling.\nHowever, Mr. Chaudhary clarified that members were permitted to discuss the supplementary demands and administrative lapses of the state machinery involved in implementing the exercise.\nHe cautioned that there was a “thin line” between criticising State administration and attacking the autonomy of ECI and warned members not to cross it.\nAfter being allowed to speak, AAP MLA Chaitar Vasava alleged there was a sudden influx of thousands of Form 7 applications around January 17 and 18 across constituencies to delete names of registered voters from the rolls.\nHe claimed several such applications were filed without supporting documents and individuals whose names appeared on the forms denied submitting them on being contacted by his team.\nCongress MLA Jignesh Mevani invoked the Constitution drafted by Babasaheb Ambedkar to assert that voting is a fundamental right.\n“As part of a pre-planned strategy, there was an attempt to remove names of nearly 14 lakh people belonging to a particular community in Gujarat. Such acts will destroy social harmony in Gujarat. The State government must identify those behind these fraudulent Form 7s, file FIRs and send them to jail,” said Mr. Mevani.\nHe claimed De-notified Tribes (DNT) and nomadic communities, who lack permanent addresses, may lose voting rights for the lack of even one document.\nCongress MLA Amrutji Thakor claimed election authorities were not accepting Aadhaar or even EPIC cards as valid documents to enter names in the revised electoral rolls.\nOn the issue of deletion of names through Form 7, Mr. Thakor stated that citizens have a democratic right to know who is “actively trying to snatch their voting rights by secretly filing these forms against them”.\nIn his response, Finance Minister Kanubhai Desai said Form 7 is the prescribed procedure for name deletion but no name is removed merely upon its submission. Booth Level Officers conduct mandatory field verification and, if required, hearings are organised before any final decision, he added.\nFollowing a lengthy debate, the Gujarat (Supplementary) Appropriation Bill, 2026, was passed by a majority voice vote. The Congress and AAP did not extend their support to the legislation.\nGujarat\n/\nSpecial Intensive Revision of electoral rolls",

        "content": "A file photo of members of Scheduled Castes Right Communities Internal Reservation Protection Committee staging a protest in Kalaburagi.\n| Photo Credit: ARUN KULKARNI\nIn a move that has left the Dalit Left communities upset, the Karnataka government has asked the authorities/departments to kick-start the recruitment process for 56,432 posts with quota for 101 Scheduled Castes at 15%, but without internal reservation.\nWith this, while the State government has announced one of largest recruitment drives to fill posts amid pressure from aspirants, the hopes of Dalit Left communities to secure internal reservation — a demand of over three decades — has not been met.\nThe Government Order (GO), issued by the Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms, accessed by The Hindu, caps the overall quota at 50%, but 2% and 4% of posts have been asked to be reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, respectively, subject to the court’s final order on increasing reservation beyond 50%.\nThe GO asks authorities/department to initiate recruitment notifications over the next 30 days to fill 56,432 posts, based on the reservation order and 100 points roster prevailing prior to December 28, 2022. They have been asked to follow the June 20, 1995, order that fixed the roster, and continue the roster from the point where it was stopped as per the December 12, 2022, order.\nUnder each category of vertical reservation, the government has asked authorities to adhere to March 8, 2023, order to provide for reservation to ex-servicemen, physically challenged people, rural candidates, women, Kannada-medium candidates, third gender candidates and those who lost homes in projects.\nWith the government kickstarting recruitment process without provisions for internal reservation, it will in effect disregard two new pieces of legislation — The Karnataka Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Reservation of seats in Educational Institutions and of Appointments or posts in the Services under the State) Act, 2022, that increases reservation for SCs from 15 % to 17 % and STs from 3 % to 7 %, and The Karnataka Scheduled Castes (Sub-classification) Bill, 2025, for internal reservation that has received the Governor’s assent.\nThe Governor had given his assent to internal quota Bill on Thursday. In the overall 17% reservation to SCs, the Bill provides for 6% each to Dalit left and Dalit right, and 5% to “touchable” castes of Bhovi, Lambani, Korama and Koracha along with 59 nomadic communities.\nHowever, the High Court of Karnataka, in October 2025, had restrained the State government from making recruitments based on the August 25, 2025 notification of revised sub-classification of Scheduled Caste (SC) communities. The court passed this interim order hearing a petition filed by Confederation of Untouchable Nomadic Communities of Karnataka and others from the nomadic and semi-nomadic communities of SCs.\nInterestingly, the 17% reservation for SCs with internal reservation, and 7% for STs is being implemented in educational institutions.\nMeanwhile, for notification for recruitment issued before November 27, 2025, the authorities have been asked to finalise the process, but the appointment orders should compulsorily carry the condition that the recruitment is subject to the final outcome in the court.\nThe Karnataka High Court, in November 2025, held that no further notification for recruitment be done based on the increased reservation in the 2022 Act.\nThe GO comes amid claims of two Dalit Left Ministers in the Cabinet, K.H. Muniyappa and R.B. Thimmapur, that the government would not take up the recruitment process without internal reservation. With this promise, the Ministers had asked the community leaders to refrain from taking up any protest. It is learnt that the Dalit right Ministers were opposed to providing for internal reservation within the reduced quota of 15%.\nProtest on March 11, meeting Rahul\nThe Committee for Internal Reservation for Social Justice has threatened a protest on March 11 if internal reservation is not included in the recruitment. It has also threatened an indefinite fast in front of Cabinet Minister’s offices in districts, besides a Tumakuru-Bengaluru padayatra. A meeting with Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi is also planned.\n“Whether it is at 15% or 17%, internal reservation has to be provided for,” said Basavaraj Kowthal, convener of the committee, which met in Tumakuru on Saturday to draw plans for protests.\n“Dalit left communities voted for Congress this time in big numbers following assurances of internal reservation. Though the Bill has been enacted to allow this, not providing it when the largest recruitment process in recent decades is under way is social injustice,” he lamented.",

        "content": "GUWAHATI\nThe police in eastern Assam’s Jorhat district have served a notice to a Raijor Dal leader, an Indian Institute of Management alumnus, for allegedly instigating villagers to resist excavation for a flood mitigation project.\nFarmers and members of the fishing community living around a network of wetlands, including Kenduguri Beel and Kawoimari Beel, have been opposing a project to excavate about 1,700 bighas (561 acres). These wetlands, within 5 km of the southern bank of the Brahmaputra River, are in the district’s Teok area.\nThe protest intensified almost a month after the villagers submitted a memorandum to the Jorhat District Commissioner on January 20, demanding a halt to excavation activities under the ‘Flood mitigation by capacity augmentation of wetlands’ project, allegedly without any public hearing, environmental impact assessment, or social impact assessment.\nThe villagers demanded that the detailed project report be made public. They also sought transparency in the project that affects the livelihoods of hundreds of farming families and alters a natural wetland ecosystem crucial for flood mitigation and groundwater recharge.\nThe protest took a turn on Friday (February 27, 2026) when the police in Teok issued a notice to Debanga Sourav Gogoi, a spokesperson of the Akhil Gogoi-led Raijor Dal, based on a first information report. Several sections under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, including those dealing with extortion and rioting, were slapped against him.\nHe has been asked to appear at the police station on March 1.\nThe protestors said the police visited Mr Gogoi’s residence in a village under the Teok police station twice at midnight since the FIR was lodged a few days ago. “He is being singled out for raising procedural and environmental questions. This is nothing but political targeting and intimidation,” a local Raijor Dal member said.\nThe Teok police did not receive calls. No official statement has been issued to address the villagers’ allegations, who fear that the project, which is presumed to create a vast reservoir, could spell disaster for them in the long run.\nThe area has been flood-free, except for a single event in 2017.",

The increasing prevalence of tobacco, cigarette and alcohol consumption, excessive mobile phone use and begging had emerged as serious social concerns, he observed.\nMr. Khadeer expressed concern that people in the age group of 25 to 30 were experiencing health problems owing to substance abuse and mobile addiction. Many were squandering money, jeopardising their future, putting a burden on their families, he said.\nFreeing young people from harmful and destructive habits was essential to building a strong and healthy nation, he added.\nBasavaraj Malge, honorary president of the Backwards Classes Federation, said awareness campaigns were being conducted across the district against social evils. With the cooperation of all sections of society, he said all-out efforts would be made to make Bidar an addiction-free district.\nBNSS secretary Ashok Wadgave said social evils impede both individual growth and societal progress and must be effectively addressed. Suresh Chanashetti, president of the district unit of the Kannada Sahitya Parishat, described the campaign as a positive step towards building a healthy society.\nThe samiti would also distribute pamphlets on the harmful effects of addiction and launch door-to-door awareness drives.",

File\n| Photo Credit: The Hindu\nAs the Union Food Ministry decided to temporarily discontinue the process of rice fortification “until a more effective mechanism for delivery of nutrients to beneficiaries is identified”, activists who had challenged the scheme in the Supreme Court welcomed the move and said fortification is not a scientific method to curb anaemia.\nOn Friday (February 27, 2026), the government announced that it had reviewed the implementation of rice fortification under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) and other welfare schemes. “Based on this review, it has been decided to temporarily discontinue the process of rice fortification under PMGKAY and allied schemes until a more effective mechanism for delivery of nutrients to beneficiaries is identified,” the Food Ministry said, citing a study by IIT Kharagpur to assess the shelf life of fortified rice kernels (FRK) and fortified rice (FR) under actual storage conditions in diverse agro climatic zones in the country.\n“The report concludes that factors such as moisture content, storage conditions, temperature, relative humidity, and packaging material critically influence the stability and shelf life of FRK and FR. They are susceptible to micronutrient reduction and shortening of shelf life during prolonged storage and routine handling. This reduction is rendering the effective shelf life shorter than expected and, in turn, limiting the intended nutritional outcomes,” the release added.\nThe government maintained that the decision does not entail any reduction in foodgrain entitlements and will not affect operations under the public distribution system, Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), or the Mid-Day Meal Scheme.\nWelcoming the decision, social activist Kavitha Kuruganti said rice fortification is an expensive and ineffective intervention, which is is unsafe and toxic. “While the government is citing a study to stop this large-scale fortification, we had shown much evidence that not all anaemia is linked to iron deficiency, nor is fortification an effective solution. We had filed a public interest litigation petition in the Supreme Court on this matter and the government could not justify so far their aberrant and inconsistent behaviour with regard to statutory regulations on fortified food,” she said.\nIndia\n/\nhealth",

File\n| Photo Credit: ANI\nVeteran Congress leader and former Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Saturday (February 28, 2026) sought the restoration of the public welfare schemes launched by his government, which have been discontinued or diluted by the current Bharatiya Janata Party government in the State. Mr. Gehlot raised the demand after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Ajmer.\nMr. Gehlot, who wrote a letter to Mr. Modi on this issue ahead of his visit, said the people were expecting the Prime Minister to speak on such issues of public interest. He pointed out that Mr. Modi himself had promised, during the State Assembly election campaign in 2023, that no scheme of the Congress government would be shut down if the BJP came to power.\n“Do you not want the entire country to receive the right to health like Rajasthan? Do you have no interest in revolutionary decisions like the Gig Workers Welfare Act and the Urban Employment Guarantee?” Mr. Gehlot asked in a post on X.\nMr. Gehlot said the BJP government had changed the name of the Eastern Rajasthan Canal Project, but had failed to do any work on it. Regarding the problem of leaked papers in recruitment exams, he said the Prime Minister should have praised the State’s stringent law which includes provisions such as life imprisonment, a fine of ₹10 crore, and the confiscation of the culprits’ property.\n“Instead of engaging in politics to mislead the youth, you should have spoken about enacting such a strict law at the Centre. The BJP government is not even able to show the courage to investigate the OMR sheet scam that occurred during its present tenure,” Mr. Gehlot said.\nThe former Chief Minister said it would have been better if Mr. Modi had stood by his guarantee given during the Assembly election not to discontinue existing welfare schemes, and directed CM Bhajan Lal Sharma to restart the closed schemes. “Your hollow slogan of ‘double engine’ is now proving to be ‘double zero’ in Rajasthan,” Mr. Gehlot remarked.\nIn his letter to Mr. Modi, Mr. Gehlot had expressed concern over the delay in payments under health insurance schemes, changes in the free electricity scheme, and the discontinuation of Annapurna ration kits as well as the Indira Gandhi credit card scheme. Apart from this, several infrastructure projects in Jaipur, Jodhpur, and Kota, including hospitals and institutes, had not been operationalised despite being completed, he alleged.\nRajasthan\n/\nstate politics",

Krishnan had said during the recently concluded AI Impact Summit that the facility would start putting out chips by the end of February. The facility has enjoyed 50% capital support from the Union government’s India Semiconductor Mission, amounting to ₹22,516 crore. This was further supplemented by a 20% capital support by the Gujarat government.\nA proud day for India! Micron Technology's Semiconductor ATMP facility was inaugurated in Sanand earlier today. Here are some glimpses from the occasion…@MicronTech@MicronCEOpic.twitter.com/y4vrYEMhdy\nAn ATMP facility packages semiconductors after they have been fabricated elsewhere. The facility in Sanand will focus on data storage chips, converting “advanced DRAM and NAND wafers from Micron’s global manufacturing network into finished memory and storage products,” Micron said in a statement.\n“Micron’s DRAM and NAND solutions power data centres, AI applications, mobile devices, and advanced computing systems around the world,” Mr. Modi said at the inauguration. “Now they will be built right here, on this land of Sanand. Here, advanced wafers will be converted into high quality memory and storage products. Hundreds of people have been employed in this plant. It will expand further in the coming time,” he added.\nMicron said it expected to package “tens of millions” of chips this year, and “hundreds of millions” next year. The “growing global demand for memory and storage fueled by AI” would ensure that the production scales healthily, it said.\nLate in 2025, Micron shifted away from the consumer memory market altogether to focus its energies on the AI industry’s demand for memory chips, the prices of which have soared. Assuming that the demand for these chips holds, it’s practically guaranteed that Micron will be able to get a return on its investment into the facility at Sanand, especially with the capital support it received.\n“Micron built and is operating the assembly and test facility in accordance with the company’s sustainability goals, rigorous health and safety standards, and with local and global environmental commitments,” Micron said in a statement. “The facility is designed to meet or exceed Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold standards.

Supabase has grown in popularity in recent months among developers as a cheap way to host and serve their projects, by giving them flexibility to choose vendors and offering hosting prices that are competitive.\nA senior government official declined to discuss the specific reasons for the website’s blocking, but said that “information was being shared that should not have been shared”, and that the relevant parties were “working it out”.\nThe official added that the site was blocked under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000. It is unclear if Supabase, whose employees are spread around the world remotely, has engaged the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology on the blocking order.\nIn an update on Friday (February 27, 2026), the firm said that it was following up “through all available channels to resolve this issue”.\nWebsite blocking orders are rarely made public, and they propagate slowly, leading to initial speculation that certain operators — which were among the first to comply with the blocking order — had misconfigured their systems.

Narayanan stated on Saturday that he was mentored and guided by Mr. Suresh throughout his career.”\nMr. Narayanan spoke in Shivamogga after releasing the Kannada translation of Suresh’s biography, “Onto a Rocket Ship.” The book, originally written by Sunil Suresh, has been translated into Kannada by Turuvanooru Mallikarjun, a faculty member at Jnanadeepa School in Shivamogga.\nMr. Narayanan said that ISRO, in the last six decades, has made India proud with its many accomplishments. Suresh joined the institute as an engineer a few days before it was formally founded in 1969. “Mr. Suresh has been part of the journey of ISRO. In fact, the story of Suresh is the story of ISRO as well. He was part of the team that worked on India’s first indigenous satellite launch vehicle under the leadership of Dr. A.P.J.

Acknowledging Suresh's leadership qualities, Mr. Narayanan observed that whenever a mission is accomplished successfully, many claim credit, but not during failures. “We salute Mr. Suresh because he took responsibility when one of the missions failed,” he recalled. He also mentioned that Suresh mentored many scientists in his career and many of them became chairmen of the institute.\nExpressing happiness about the release of the Kannada translation of his biography, Mr. Narayanan said that the book would inspire many students from rural backgrounds in Karnataka to achieve great things in their lives.\nThe programme was organised by the Sri Aurobindo Foundation for Education to mark the National Science Day.

        "content": "In a major drive to sensitise the public against the growing threat of waste pollution, the Kerala Solid Waste Management Project (KSWMP) has launched the ‘Clean Kerala Anthem’. Minister for Education V. Sivankutty officially released the anthem and video at a ceremony held at the Nishagandhi Auditorium here on Saturday (February 28, 2026).\nThe ‘Clean Kerala Anthem’ is envisioned as a musical catalyst to usher in a new culture of cleanliness across the State.\nDesigned to resonate with all age groups, particularly the youth, the video blends high-energy dance sequences with a modern hip-hop and rap rhythm. The anthem revolves around the powerful and evocative slogan: “My Waste, My Responsibility; My Kerala, My Pride.”\nThe song aims to bring about a behavioural shift by highlighting that dumping waste in public spaces is a matter of social shame. Instead, it promotes a new ‘trend’ for the modern Keralites:systematic segregation of plastic and organic waste at the source, followed by its prompt transfer to the Haritha Karma Sena (Green Task Force).\nThe launch comes at a crucial juncture as KSWMP scales up its efforts to establish state-of-the-art waste treatment plants and modern processing systems across Kerala. The anthem serves as a reminder that while the government provides the infrastructure, the ultimate success of these projects depends on the active participation of citizens through proper waste segregation at home, said officials.\nThe song for KSWMP was created by Bworld Corporate Solutions. To ensure maximum reach and public engagement, the anthem will be promoted extensively through Instagram reels, YouTube shorts, and social media dance challenges. The track is also available for streaming on major music platforms, including Spotify. Through this creative initiative, the KSWMP and the State government aim to turn the dream of a ‘Beautiful, waste-Free Kerala’ into a collective reality.",

        "content": "HYDERABAD\nThe Irrigation Department of Telangana has complained to the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) against the unauthorised projects taken up by Andhra Pradesh in violation of the AP Reorganisation Act 2014 and without securing approvals and clearances from the statutory agencies. It has requested the Board to restrain AP from taking up new projects.\nIn a letter addressed to the Chairman of the River Board, Engineer-in-Chief of Telangana O.V. Ramesh Babu said in response to the KRMB’s letter to the Ministry of Jal Shakti, Telangana had submitted a compiled statement of government orders issued by AP in violation of the APRA 2014 according administrative sanctions for ₹47,776.5 crore works related to the utilisation of Krishna river waters through a letter addressed in 2021.\nThe works pertain to entirely new projects and proposals aimed at further enhancing the scope and extent of diversions at Pothireddypadu Head Regulator (PRP-HR) intended for utilisation in projects such as SRBC (Srisailam Right Bank Canal), TGP (Telugu Ganga Project), GNSS (Galeru-Nagari Sujala Sravanthi) and HNSS (Handri-Neeva Sujala Sravanthi) from Srisailam.\nFurther, detailed communications were sent to the river board in 2022 and 2023 clearly bringing out the project-wise violations committed by AP with a request to the river board to restrain AP from undertaking any new schemes or capacity enhancements without due appraisal and recommendations of KRMB, approval of the Apex Council, stating that such actions by AP would have a direct and adverse impact on the legitimate water rights of Telangana.\nDespite repeated requests and detailed representations made by Telangana, the unauthorised constructions and capacity expansions were being carried out by AP and no action was initiated either by the KRMB or by the Centre. In a striking contrast, the river board has written to the MoJS raising objectins to the projects of Telangana, “which appears wholly untenable and misplaced”, the ENC said.\nIn consonance with further terms of reference issued by the MoJS in October 2023, which expressly provide for project specific allocations by the KWDT-II Telangana has projected its demands and is seeking appropriate allocations, the ENC said.\nHe explained that Telangana had already furnished replies to the issues raised by AP through its letters addressed to the river board in 2021 and the projects were taken up by Telangana in accordance with the liberty granted by KWDT-I. Telangana had taken up additional online and offline storages within the basin, all of which were in existence prior to 2014 and do not attract provisions of the APRA 2014. In contrast, AP had consistently resorted to “clandestine diversion of waters outside the basin through PRP-HR”, he pointed out.\nAdditional demands planned by AP\nUtilisation of and additional 114.75 tmc ft for irrigating 4,67,326 acres new ayacut in Kurnool, Kadapa, Anantapur, Chittoor, Prakasam and Nellore districts through existing projects\nUtilisation of another 176.46 tmc ft planned under contemplated projects for irrigating 6,30,882 acres new ayacut in Guntur, Prakasam, Kurnool, Kadapa and Anantapur districts\nPlea of Telangana\nAsk AP to desist from making misleading allegations against the projects of Telangana intended to serve drought-prone and backward areas within the Krishna Basin\nPrevent AP from undertaking any new projects, expansions or drawals of water without due appraisal, recommendation and approval of the river board, Apex Council until finalisation of water shares by KWDT-II\nTake to the notice of MoJS the violations of AP highlighted by Telangana",

Ragesh\nTown planning, waste management, environment, and health have received major thrust in the first Budget of the present council of the Kozhikode Corporation for 2026-27.\nThe ₹161.18-crore surplus Budget, with a revenue of ₹1,221.2 crore and an expenditure of ₹1,060.01 crore, was presented by deputy mayor S. Jayasree on Saturday (February 28). She also presented the revised estimates for the 2025-26 Budget.\nFollowing the death of four headload workers in the collapse of the concrete slab of an old civic body-owned godown at Valiyangadi recently, the Budget has allocated ₹20 crore for the demolition and renovation of old structures within the city limits. “The Engineering, Health and Revenue departments will conduct a joint inspection and prepare a status report. Based on the findings, unsafe structures will be demolished, and those requiring renovation will be repaired,” Ms. Jayasree said in her Budget speech.\nRegarding waste management, the deputy mayor said a permanent solution to the legacy waste at Njeliyanparamba would be achieved during the Budget year. “The biomining process for removing the legacy waste has already commenced. The project is being implemented at a cost of ₹31 crore under the Kerala Solid Waste Management Project fund. With the establishment of BPCL’s CNG plant, the issues at the Njeliyanparamba plant can be fully resolved. A comprehensive master plan will be prepared for the remaining land, and projects will be formulated accordingly. The master plan will be prepared during the Budget year,” she said, adding that the construction of the West Hill and Sarovaram sewage treatment plants would begin in 2026-27.\nIn a bid to control air pollution in the city, a carbon audit will be conducted with the support of institutions such as the Centre for Water Resources Development and Management and the  Kerala Institute of Local Administration. Ms. Jayasree said the audit would be carried out at regular intervals. An initial sum of ₹10 lakh has been allocated in the Budget to implement projects aimed at ensuring air quality based on its findings. Further, a project titled ‘Haritha Residence’ will be formulated and implemented with the cooperation of residents’ associations. The detailed project plan will be prepared in consultation with the associations. This initiative, according to her, will contribute to ensuring the purity of air and water.\nThe Budget has proposed renovating Mananchira under the City Beautification project and transforming it into the city’s natural “oxygen parlour”.\nIn the health sector, the Budget proposes expanding palliative care services to ensure beneficiaries can access them through all health centres in the city. The plan includes integrating Ayurveda and Homoeopathy centres into the palliative care network. Secondary palliative care services will also be introduced. The civic body will take steps to make physiotherapy facilities available to palliative care patients, the deputy mayor said.\nAccording to the Budget, a scheme will be launched this year to provide short-term accommodation within the city limits for economically disadvantaged patients who have undergone kidney transplant surgery to prevent infections during the recovery period. An amount of ₹50 lakh has been allocated for the first phase of the project. A new health centre has been proposed at Ponnamkode Kunnu.\nOn the stray dog issue, the Budget has proposed setting up cages in all wards, with the support of dog lovers, to relocate sick or aggressive dogs. An amount of ₹20 lakh has been earmarked for the project. “The feasibility of establishing a laboratory in the city to test for rabies will be examined, and steps will be taken to implement it as soon as possible,” Ms. Jayasree said. A ‘Bow Bow Fest’ will be organised for those who adopt puppies, she added.\nAs part of the AMRUT 2.0 scheme, projects aimed at improving the drinking water supply system and sewage treatment infrastructure have been included. An amount of ₹166.16 crore has been allocated for the plant to be established at West Hill, and ₹164.2 crore has been earmarked for the plant to be set up at Sarovaram, the deputy mayor said.\nOn the infrastructure front, an amount of ₹16.5 crore has been set aside for new roads. Besides, another ₹31.1 crore has been earmarked for the repair of various roads across the Corporation.",

        "content": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday inaugurated Micron Technology’s Assembly, Testing, Marking and Packaging (ATMP) facility in Sanand, Gujarat, marking the launch of India’s first domestically produced semiconductor chips. The project positions Gujarat as an emerging centre in the global semiconductor supply chain.\nAddressing the gathering, PM Modi said the facility sends a strong message globally about India’s technological capability. He said the project shows that “India is capable, India is competitive, India is committed,\" and reflects the country’s growing role in the global electronics ecosystem.\nThe Prime Minister described the Sanand project as more than just an industrial investment. According to him, it demonstrates how policy support, manufacturing readiness and global confidence are coming together to strengthen India’s semiconductor mission.\nPM Modi also highlighted the importance of India’s partnership with the United States in advanced technologies. “Today’s program at this facility is evidence of strong collaboration and partnership between India and America,\" he said, noting that cooperation in areas such as artificial intelligence and semiconductor manufacturing will shape the future global technology order.\nA proud day for India!Micron Technology’s Semiconductor ATMP facility was inaugurated in Sanand earlier today.\nHere are some glimpses from the occasion…@MicronTech @MicronCEO pic.twitter.com/y4vrYEMhdy\n— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) February 28, 2026\nReflecting on India’s technological journey, PM Modi said that discussions around chips and data were limited in the country a decade ago, when the focus was largely on IT services.\n“Today India, known for software, is successfully making its mark in hardware as well,\" he said, pointing to a shift towards manufacturing and innovation.\nHe compared the importance of semiconductors in the modern era to the role of machines during the Industrial Revolution. “If oil was the regulator of the last century, the microchip will be the regulator of this century,\" he said, emphasising the strategic importance of semiconductor production.\nPM Modi also spoke about the transformation of Sanand, which evolved from hosting a single automobile plant to becoming one of India’s major auto hubs.\nHe suggested that Micron’s investment could similarly create a strong semiconductor ecosystem by attracting suppliers, technology partners and new businesses.\nRecalling the region’s industrial journey, the Prime Minister mentioned late industrialist Ratan Tata and said he once sent a message saying, “see what a Gujarati can do with an investment of one rupee,\" highlighting Gujarat’s spirit of entrepreneurship.\nThe Micron ATMP facility has been built with an investment of Rs 22,516 crore. It will assemble and package chips used in SSDs and RAM modules, linking India directly to global electronics supply chains. The project is expected to generate around 5,000 jobs.\nPM Modi said the semiconductor sector will create new opportunities for young people and strengthen India’s technological independence.\n“This opportunity is opening new gates for India’s youth,\" he said, adding that as more semiconductor projects begin production, their broader economic impact will become visible.\nUS Ambassador Sergio Gore also attended the event, marking his first visit to Gujarat after assuming office. His presence highlighted the growing cooperation between India and the United States in critical technology sectors.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta, at the News18 Rising Bharat Summit on Saturday, placed pollution at the heart of her government’s one-year report card, promising that the Capital would breathe “better air\" in the coming months.\nResponding to questions on whether 365 days were enough to claim achievements, Gupta struck a measured tone. “One year is not a long period to list countless achievements,\" she said, adding that what gave her satisfaction was that her government had “worked among the people, faced problems head-on and tried to deliver better solutions\".\nThe Opposition, she acknowledged, continues to argue that pollution levels remain unchanged and that traffic congestion still cripples large parts of the city. Gupta countered sharply: “If an 11-year-old government asks a one-year-old government to answer for every problem, is that fair?\"\nShe described pollution, traffic and waterlogging as “legacy problems\" inherited from the previous regime, insisting her administration had adopted a “scientific roadmap\" rather than ad-hoc responses. According to her, the real undoing has been of “corruption and leakages,\" with governance digitised and accountability tightened across departments.\nOn whether Delhi can ever truly become pollution-free, Gupta was unequivocal. “Definitely,\" she said. “Every year Delhi will see better air.\"\nShe detailed a multi-pronged strategy:\n•\tImplementation of ‘No PUC, No Fuel’ to curb vehicular emissions\n•\tInduction of 4,000 electric buses — the largest such fleet in the capital\n•\tA forthcoming EV policy with subsidies and incentives\n•\tExpansion of last-mile connectivity\n•\tAutomated vehicle fitness testing stations (two inaugurated, five planned)\n•\tNotification of 4,200 hectares of ridge area as forest\n•\tA target to plant 3.5 million indigenous trees over four years\nPollution, she argued, cannot be tackled as a seasonal crisis. “We are looking at it holistically—dust, smoke, emissions, green cover—everything together.\"\nThe conversation turned sceptical when asked whether her vision sounded more like a hill station than present-day Delhi, notorious for its traffic snarls.\nGupta insisted that improvement depends on public participation as much as policy. “If the government and the people move in one direction, things will improve. Cities like Indore have shown it can be done. No city becomes clean in one day.\"\nPressed on timelines, she avoided setting a fixed deadline. “This is not time-bound. It is an ongoing process.\"\nBut on one specific marker—the Air Quality Index this October—she was willing to commit. “Yes, Delhi will see better air,\" she said. “We will work collectively towards it.\"\nOn financial assistance to women, a politically sensitive promise, Gupta maintained that strengthening women economically remains her government’s intent. She said an eligibility list is being prepared and the scheme will be implemented through an online portal to ensure transparency and avoid leakages.\nYet it was clear that, at the summit, pollution defined the narrative of her first year in office.\nWith winter historically bringing a blanket of smog over the Capital, Gupta’s assurance of “better AQI this October\" now stands as a measurable benchmark.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "At a time of heightened geopolitical tensions and renewed debates over secularism, exiled Bangladeshi author Taslima Nasreen delivered a forceful and controversial defence of regime change in certain Islamic nations, while also pushing back against claims that Muslims are unsafe in India.\nSpeaking at Network18’s Rising Bharat Summit 2026 on Saturday, Nasreen was asked whether powerful nations have the right to engineer regime change in countries they “do not like\", citing examples from Iran to Bangladesh.\nThe controversial author, who has been living in New Delhi in exile, argued that each country’s situation is different but maintained that Iran’s clerical establishment “must be changed\", calling for a secular government that separates religion from the state.\nHer statement came hours after US and Israel launched strikes on Iran, triggering global concerns of escalation into a broader conflict in the Middle East.\nReferring to Iranian protests against compulsory hijab and the deaths of women who resisted it, Nasreen said a system based on equality and justice was essential for women’s freedom.\n“I think that in Iran, the mullah regime should be changed… so many women were murdered because they did not want to wear the compulsory hijab. So this mullah regime must be changed and a secularist government should be there in Iran,\" she said.\n“In Iran, you will find that many Muslim women do not want to wear hijab, but some Muslim women want to wear hijab,\" she added.\nTurning to homeland Bangladesh, Nasreen criticised what she described as the growing influence of Islamist forces and defended the need for secular political alternatives. She reiterated her long-held position that religion-based politics undermines democracy and minority rights.\n“Nowhere is radical Islam okay,\" Nasreen said as the conversation broadened to the status of radical Islamist movements globally.\nShe condemned the Taliban’s rule in Afghanistan for banning girls’ education and restricting women from work, arguing that any state governed by religious law inevitably erodes human rights.\nOn India, Nasreen pushed back against narratives that Muslims face systemic insecurity. An atheist from a Muslim background who has lived in India for decades, she said she has not personally encountered Muslims expressing a desire to leave the country out of fear.\n“Muslims in India, they never think of leaving India for any Muslim country. So it means that they are living in safety in India. Muslims are safe in Europe, America, India, and any non-Muslim countries. Muslims are most unsafe in Muslim countries,\" she said.\nIn contrast, she claimed that religious minorities in Bangladesh, particularly Hindus, often live in anxiety and migrate when possible. She argued that Muslims tend to seek refuge in secular democracies — Europe, America and India — rather than in Muslim-majority states, because the latter lack freedom of expression and gender equality.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "At the Rising Bharat Summit, Swiss-based military historian and author Adrien Fontanellaz highlighted the critical role of political courage and institutional trust in high-stakes military operations, citing India’s Operation Sindoor as a case in point.\n“On the political level, you really need nerves of steel to let your military be in charge of the escalation ladder and to do what they need to do because the stakes are so high,\" Fontanellaz said. “You need trust in your own institutions—this was quite striking and rare.\"\nOperation Sindoor, carried out after the Pahalgam terror attack, involved carefully calibrated strikes and military maneuvers aimed at countering insurgent networks while minimising escalation.\nAsked about India dominating the battlefield but losing the information war, the historian reflected on the complexities of modern conflict, where strategic outcomes are no longer measured solely by battlefield success. He noted that despite India having dominated the operational aspects of the conflict with Pakistan, the country lost the information war.\n“I am in two minds,\" he explained. “Of course, it is bad to lose the info war. Nowadays, communication is a line of operation itself, so it is true that the Pakistanis were better at that game.\"\nYet, Fontanellaz added a nuanced perspective on the strategic importance of such “wars of perception\". “But at the same time, is winning this info war so important at the strategic level? Because Pakistan won the info war, they did not lose face. And when you have an adversary who has not lost face, they will not reform, and in future, they will be less of a threat.\"\nFontanellaz emphasised that high-stakes operations like Op Sindoor require more than just tactical skill: they demand political trust in military institutions, courage to delegate authority, and careful management of escalation risks.\nABOUT RISING BHARAT\nRising Bharat 2026 is a global forum that reflects the confidence and capability driving India’s rise.

        "title": "A Life In 75 Milestones: Network18 Presents To PM Narendra Modi A Special Edition Book At Rising Bharat 2026",
        "content": "At the Rising Bharat 2026 event, Network18 presented Prime Minister Narendra Modi with a special edition book chronicling his life and leadership. Conceived to mark his 75th birthday, the 176-page volume captures 75 milestones that define his journey from a young student in Vadnagar and an RSS pracharak to Chief Minister of Gujarat, Prime Minister of India and a global statesman.\nTitled Modi at 75, the visually rich book was handed over to the Prime Minister by Rahul Joshi, Network18 Group Editor-in-Chief, and the core team behind the project: Brajesh Kumar Singh, Group Editor for Integration and Convergence; Rashmi Singh, Editor for Infographics; Soumyadip Choudhury, Product Head for News18 and Local18; Nadeem Alam, Executive Creative Director; Triparna Mitra, Principal Creative Director; Utpal Kumar, Deputy Executive Editor; Alankar, Principal Creative Director; and, Santanu Kumar Santan, Creative Director. The Prime Minister also met the team on the occasion.\nThe book stands apart from a conventional publication. It is both a visual archive and a carefully structured narrative. Organised into five sections, it traces his formative years, his rise in public life, his tenure as Gujarat’s Chief Minister, his ongoing leadership as Prime Minister, and his role in shaping India’s global engagement.\nThe volume draws on rarely seen archival material, including photographs, letters, memorabilia and even an entry from the Prime Minister’s diary. Several of these have not been published before. The effort behind the book was extensive. A team of six researchers worked for over five months, planning, verifying details, combing through archives and sourcing rare images to ensure that no significant milestone was overlooked.\nThis was followed by more than two months of intensive design development, illustration work and editorial review, with multiple rounds of discussions and vetting to maintain accuracy and context.\nThe project brought together some of the network’s most experienced editors and designers. It also used artificial intelligence to create illustrative renderings of moments from the Prime Minister’s life for which photographic records do not exist. One such AI-generated depiction, portraying a phase of his life as an ascetic, drew a hearty laugh from the Prime Minister when he saw it.\nAdding depth to the narrative are reflections from distinguished voices across the world. Former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has written the preface, sharing his impressions of Narendra Modi’s leadership. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addresses his friend “Narendra\" in a personal letter. The Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, Kamla Persad-Bissessar, offers her perspective, while leading figures from India’s corporate sector reflect on his vision for growth and development. Together, these contributions highlight the breadth of his global relationships and the impact of his leadership across sectors.\nThe book’s chapters reflect the arc of his public life. ‘Humble Beginnings’ traces his early years. ‘Rising Through the Ranks’ follows his grassroots work in the Sangh and the BJP. ‘A State Builder’ examines his years in Gujarat and the governance model that drew national attention. ‘Believing in Bharat’ looks at his efforts to steer a new India. ‘Navigating the Globe’ focuses on his diplomatic outreach and global partnerships.\nMore than a commemorative volume, Modi at 75 aims to serve as a reference work that sets out a clear timeline of events and achievements, addressing gaps and misconceptions that sometimes arise in fragmented news narratives. It is designed as a collector’s edition for readers interested in understanding the rise of a leader who journeyed from a small town in Gujarat to the highest elected office in the world’s largest democracy.\nAt Rising Bharat 2026, the presentation of the book and the Prime Minister’s interaction with the team celebrated not only his 75 years but also marked a moment of recognition of the collaborative effort that went into documenting them.\nYou can read the special edition Modi at 75 here: https://www.news18.com/modiat75/\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "At Rising Bharat, Expert Warns Iran Holds Multiple Cards In Latest War As Israel, US Launch Strikes",
        "content": "As open hostilities broke out between Iran and the US-Israel axis on Saturday, a stark warning emerged from News18’s Rising Bharat Summit—Tehran holds multiple levers of retaliation, and events may no longer be in Washington or Tel Aviv’s control.\nSpeaking at the summit, Swiss-based military historian Adrien Fontanellaz said the unfolding conflict underscores a deeper global shift, one where assumptions of dominance and predictability have eroded.\nFontanellaz placed the current confrontation in the context of a broader geopolitical transition. “In the early 2000s, we thought we were living in a completed world, governed by international law,\" he said. “But for over a decade now, everything has been unravelling.\"\nAccording to him, the move from a unipolar order dominated by the United States to a multipolar system—with powers such as India rising—has generated friction and instability. “We are now back in a conflicted world until a new paradigm emerges,\" he noted, describing the present moment as “highly risky.\"\nThe outbreak of direct hostilities between Iran and Israel, with US involvement, appears to reflect precisely that volatility.\nFontanellaz drew comparisons between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, arguing that both leaders demonstrated a belief in swift, decisive operations that avoid prolonged entanglement. He cited Russia’s short 2008 war with Georgia and the subsequent annexation of Crimea as examples of quick strategic wins that may have shaped Moscow’s later miscalculation in Ukraine. What was expected to be another rapid success instead turned into a grinding, protracted conflict involving Russia, Ukraine and Western Europe.\nFontanellaz suggested that Washington may be facing a similar strategic gamble in confronting Iran. “So far, military operations have been clean, under control, and scoring PR points,\" he observed. “But the danger this time in going against Iran is that we have no control over what the Iranians will do.\"\nThe historian stressed that Tehran possesses “several serious options\" in the event of escalation. Among them, he said, were targeting American naval assets in the Persian Gulf, deploying an arsenal of at least 1,000 long-range ballistic missiles, launching thousands of shorter-range missiles capable of striking bases in Saudi Arabia, activating regional allies and Tehran-backed militias. He also described Iran’s long-range missile capability—alongside its nuclear potential—as a form of strategic insurance. “My assumption is they will not renounce them so easily,\" he said, implying that Iran’s deterrent posture is deeply embedded in its national security doctrine, and any attempt to degrade it risks triggering broader retaliation.\nWhat makes the present moment particularly dangerous, Fontanellaz warned, is the unpredictability of Iran’s response. “What is frightening,\" he said, “is that the Israelis and the Americans don’t have control over Iran’s possibility to escalate.\"\nWith war now underway, that uncertainty looms large. Unlike previous limited strikes or shadow conflicts, Saturday’s developments risk drawing in regional actors, disrupting energy corridors, and widening into a sustained confrontation.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "News18 Rising Bharat Summit 2026 Day 2 Highlights: Day 2 of the News18 Rising Bharat Summit 2026 began on Saturday, bringing together an exceptional lineup of influential voices from across government, business, technology, economics, sustainability, entertainment and sports.\nAmong the prominent attendees are cricketers Mithali Raj, MD Shami and Yuzvendra Chahal, Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta, General Sir Nick Carter, former Chief of the Defence Staff of the UK, Defence Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh, and Sarvam AI co-founder Pratyush Kumar.\nCentered on the theme “Strength Within,” the summit serves as a dynamic global forum highlighting the confidence and capability driving India’s rise. It aims to unite policymakers, industry leaders and changemakers to chart a future powered by India’s own ambition and resilience. Positioned at the intersection of national purpose and global aspiration, Rising Bharat 2026 seeks to transform inner resolve into a roadmap for excellence on the world stage, inviting participants to be part of a movement shaping a stronger, self-reliant Bharat. Follow for live updates.\nSpeaking at the Rising Bharat Summit 2026, Defence Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh said India will continue to safeguard its strategic interests in Iran’s Chabahar port while ensuring access to key regions.\n“We will have to negotiate our way so that our interest in Chabahar are sustained and it brings us benefits in terms of access to Central Asia and Afghanistan,” he said.\nSingh also highlighted India’s strategic autonomy in global engagement. Referring to the recently concluded International Fleet Review, he said India has been able to bring different nations together despite geopolitical differences.\n“In the recently concluded international fleet review, our strategic autonomy is distinct in that we were able to get Americans, Iranians on the table,” he said.\nHe added that India’s ability to work with multiple countries while maintaining its own strategic priorities has been evident over the years.\n“India’s ability to strike, align and engage with different countries has shone over the years,” Singh noted.\nSpeaking at the Rising Bharat Summit 2026, ideaForge CEO Ankit Mehta said India’s defence procurement process has become significantly faster in recent years.\nHe noted that since 2020, fast-track procurement has been introduced in the defence sector, helping speed up the acquisition of equipment and technology.\nMehta added that the new Defence Acquisition Procedure (DAP) is further strengthening the procurement system.\nHe also highlighted that the time taken to adopt new technologies has reduced sharply. According to him, the process that earlier took months or even years is now completed within weeks.\nAt the Rising Bharat Summit 2026, Abhishek Singh from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) highlighted the need for stronger digital infrastructure as the use of artificial intelligence expands in India.\nHe said that if nearly 10 to 20 crore people in the country begin using AI-based services for different needs, the current backend systems will have to be significantly upgraded.\n“Given the size of our country, if 10–20 crore people start using these services for various purposes, we will need to upend the backend infrastructure. 100,000 to 200,000 GPUs will be the minimum we will need to meet the demand of India,” he said.\nSpeaking at the Rising Bharat Summit 2026, Jean Touboul, CEO of Pernod Ricard, said the company is focusing on encouraging consumers to choose better-quality products rather than increasing consumption.\n“Value is more important than volume. As I said, premiumization, which has been a strategy that we have applied worldwide and in India for many years means, we really want to push consumer to drink, better,” he said.\nSpeaking at the Rising Bharat Summit 2026, Swiss-based military historian Adrien Fontanellaz said Iran has several possible options if it decides to retaliate against Israel and the United States.\nHe indicated that Tehran has different strategic and military avenues it could pursue in response to rising tensions in the region.\nSwiss-based military historian and author Adrien Fontanellaz spoke on the evolving global power dynamics, saying, “We are switching into a different world with several equal powers, perhaps four or five real global powers, India will be one of them obviously and during this transition, we are seeing frictions. We are seeing a reshuffling of cards, which is generating conflict.”\nFontanellaz highlighted that as new powers emerge and global influence shifts, the world is witnessing increased tensions and conflicts driven by this geopolitical realignment.\nShiprocket co-founder Gautam Kapoor highlighted India’s entrepreneurial spirit, particularly among its youth. He said, “India is the land of entrepreneurs. A large part of the young part of Bharat is actually becoming an entrepreneur rather than looking for a job. I think e-commerce is one of those places where people find a lot of connect and they are able to create brands and products by investing less money. So, what the Indian ecosystem of manufacturing has done is that the capability of any brand to go back and go to a manufacturer to create a fashion brand… if they have a good idea and then it will go to a smaller batch of manufacturers…, so you can really start now, and that is what is fueling this flurry of new brands coming with interesting products.”\nKapoor emphasised that accessible manufacturing and e-commerce platforms are enabling young Indians to launch innovative brands and products with minimal investment.\nDTDC Express CEO Abhishek Chakraborty highlighted the growing emphasis on local production in India. He said, “The one story that has stood out very clearly is that the Indian brands, the Indian sellers, the Indian manufacturers have actually taken that as a big clue to take it upon themselves and honestly start focusing on actual domestic production, actual domestic manufacturing.”\nPernod Ricard India CEO Jean Touboul praised India’s workforce for its high level of education and talent. He said, “My experience working with Indian is that the workforce is extremely well educated. So you have people who are really able to do that. We as a group source talent from India, send them abroad and sometimes they come back to contribute again to Indian business. We see India as a manufacturer of talent that’s really helpful for the entire group.” Touboul highlighted how Indian professionals play a crucial role not only domestically but also in supporting the company’s global operations.\nResponding to a question on brand differentiation in India’s competitive market, Pernod Ricard India CEO Jean Touboul emphasised the importance of local relevance. He said, “India is not a market where you apply only a global recipe. You have to be locally relevant. That’s what we try to do with our brands. Which are, for most of them, produced here, in India, for Indians and we are trying to be very accurate in the experience we provide to the consumers.” Touboul highlighted that adapting global strategies to suit Indian tastes and producing locally are key to delivering meaningful consumer experiences.\nMohammad Shami expressed his support for regional language commentary in sports, saying, “I prefer local languages for commentary in sports. India has so many languages and people living in villages don’t always understand English.”\nFormer cricketer Mithali Raj reflected on the unpredictable nature of sports and life, saying, “Sports is a risk. There is no guarantee in sports that, despite you scoring a hundred today, tomorrow you might get out on the first ball, so there is no guarantee in that, but what you can do best is that you can back them, back our team…In life, there are a lot of fluctuations. Sometimes you are peaking and sometimes you are in the valley.” She emphasized resilience and unwavering support, noting that both sport and life are filled with highs and lows, and what truly matters is standing by the team through every phase.\nAt the Summit, cricketer Yuzvendra Chahal spoke about the spirit of teamwork in cricket, emphasising that individual selection matters less than collective success. He said, “I don’t think it’s hard to miss any matches. It’s a team game. If you are on the bench with the team, even if I don’t play, winning the match is a joint win.” Chahal underlined the importance of unity and shared responsibility, noting that every victory belongs to the entire squad, whether on the field or off it.\nDuring Day 2 of the Summit, cricketer Mohammed Shami reminisced about his experiences in the 2023 World Cup, calling it a career highlight. He said, “Those were the best days of my life,” reflecting on the memorable moments and teamwork that made the tournament an unforgettable chapter in his journey as an athlete.\n#CricketFever | Reflecting on the 2023 World Cup campaign, @MdShami11 speaks about his standout spells and the mindset he carries into major tournaments#RisingBharatSummit2026 #WorldCup2023 | @ShivaniGupta_5 pic.twitter.com/U0vlNrcJBV\n— News18 (@CNNnews18) February 28, 2026\nAditya B Chatterjee, MD of Equifax India, revealed that India suffered losses of approximately Rs 34,000 crore to scams last year. His statement underscores the growing concern around financial fraud and highlights the need for stronger risk management and monitoring mechanisms within the country’s lending and banking sectors.\nAditya B Chatterjee, MD of Equifax India, shared insights on lending behavior, stating, “All the lenders have become very cautious. They have become very cautious on the ticket size.  We are seeing that there is a direct effect of the ticket size and delinquency. Again, zero to 15,000 is a very high delinquency, but if we go to a loan above one lakh or two lakh, it becomes very secure.\nHemant Gala, CEO of PhonePe Lending, highlighted the next phase in the fintech sector, emphasising the importance of formalization. He said, “Formalisation phase coming, which leads to data understanding of structured data formats to be able to figure out what is the credit spending, how to lend and how to give money to people.”\nSEBI’s Kamlesh Chandra Varshney said, “Now that verified tick is available only on those apps which have been verified. So that is a very important step which has been taken.  We are very thankful to Google, who has helped us in doing this. We are still negotiating with Apple.”\nSEBI Whole-Time Member Kamlesh Chandra Varshney spoke about the distinctive nature of India’s financial ecosystem, stating, “The way our stock market works is unique in the world.” He highlighted the regulatory framework, investor behavior and market mechanisms that set India apart. “We can proudly say there are some initiatives that we have taken to protect market and investors’ interests, which no other country has done. We are doing things on our own. T+1 settlement was done in India first, the US followed after us,” he added.\nSEBI Whole-Time Member Kamlesh Chandra Varshney spoke about the distinctive nature of India’s financial ecosystem, stating, “The way our stock market works is unique in the world.” He highlighted the regulatory framework, investor behavior and market mechanisms that set India apart. “We can proudly say there are some initiatives that we have taken to protect market and investors’ interests, which no other country has done.

        "content": "Days after three members of a family died by suicide, reportedly by consuming a poisonous substance, police have arrested the main accused, identified as Vaibhav Rungta, in Delhi for allegedly forcing the family to take the drastic step.\nBalmukund Khetan, a native of Bihar, his wife Priyanka and their elder daughter died at their residence in Surat’s Vesu area on Tuesday after allegedly consuming a poisonous substance. The couple’s younger daughter, who is seven years old, survived and is currently receiving treatment, according to police.\nThe investigation uncovered a trail of financial abuse. A three-page suicide note was recovered from the scene, which accused Vaibhav Rungta of massive credit card fraud and relentless mental torture, according to a report by NDTV. The note revealed that Rungta allegedly misused Khetan’s credit cards.\nWhen Balmukund, a stock trader who worked from home, demanded his money back, he was met with verbal abuse and death threats. The family chose to take the extreme step due to constant mental and financial pressures.\nYoungest Daughter ‘Spoon-Fed’ Poison\nThe youngest daughter, identified as Prithvi, told cops that she had been “spoon-fed\" something by her parents, which led investigators to believe that the children were poisoned first before the couple consumed the substance themselves, according to the NDTV report.\nThe family consumed aluminium phosphide, a highly toxic substance. On the day of the incident, Priyanka informed her father that they had consumed prison. Although an ambulance rushed the family to the hospital, most of them could not be saved. Balmukund was declared dead at the scene, while Priyanka and their elder daughter, Bhavya, succumbed to their injuries during treatment.\nPolice are now investigating whether other moneylenders or accomplices were involved in the harassment, and the victim’s bank accounts and credit card transactions are being audited for evidence.\nAfter the mass suicide, Vesu police team caught Rungta in Delhi following technical surveillance. A local Delhi court refused transit remand to Rungta, ordering the accused to appear in person before the Surat court instead.\nSuicide Prevention. News 18.

        "title": "Rising Bharat Summit | PM Modi Hails Rise Of 'New India', Assails Congress For 'Defaming Nation'",
        "content": "At the News18 Rising Bharat Summit on Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivered a powerful address that balanced a scathing critique of the political opposition with a soaring vision of a self-confident, “Aatmanirbhar\" India. The Prime Minister asserted that when the “hidden strength\" of a nation awakens, it achieves accomplishments that amaze the world. However, he lamented that despite decades of independence, certain political factions remain shackled to a “colonial mindset\", acting as a “toolkit\" of opposition that belittles national achievements on the global stage.\nA significant portion of the Prime Minister’s speech was dedicated to the recent AI Summit, which he described as a moment of immense national pride where India moved from being a consumer to a creator of technology. He sharply criticised the Congress party for attempting to turn this global celebration into a political spectacle. PM Modi remarked that the “country’s oldest party\" revealed its “ideological bankruptcy\" by attempting to defame the nation in front of foreign guests. He suggested that when frustration from repeated failure takes over, it manifests as arrogance that harms the country’s image. He further noted that the Congress often uses the name of Mahatma Gandhi as a shield to hide its mistakes while reserving all credit for a single family when things go well.\nThe Prime Minister highlighted the dramatic shift in India’s digital landscape, particularly through the “JAM Trinity\" (Jan Dhan, Aadhaar, and Mobile). He noted that while ATMs arrived in India far later than in developed nations, the country has leapfrogged to become a global leader in digital payments. This infrastructure has revolutionised welfare, allowing the government to transfer Rs 24 lakh crore directly to beneficiaries, effectively plugging the leakages that were once accepted as an unavoidable truth. He pointed out that an India where 30 million families lived in darkness before 2014 is now a global leader in solar power and boasts the world’s third-largest metro rail network.\nThe Prime Minister drew a sharp contrast between the “slow and delayed\" India of the past and the “Fast and Fearless\" India of 2026. He cited the transformation of the Indian Railways through Vande Bharat and Namo Bharat as evidence of this new pace. On the economic front, he noted that India has managed to control inflation—which was once in double digits—and has successfully negotiated trade deals with developed nations from a position of “Aatmanirbhar\" strength. He declared that India has officially become the “world’s growth engine\", driven by a generation of Gen Z voters who are ready to teach a lesson to those immersed in “family loyalty\" rather than national duty.\nThe Prime Minister also took aim at regional governments for stalling central welfare schemes. He highlighted that the Ayushman Bharat health scheme, providing free treatment up to Rs 5 lakh, remains unimplemented in West Bengal. Similarly, he noted that while 9.5 lakh houses were allotted to the poor in Tamil Nadu under PM Awas Yojana, construction for 3 lakh homes has stalled because the DMK government is “not taking interest\". He added that such delays are a result of insincere intentions, contrasting them with his government’s mission to ensure that no citizen is left behind in the journey towards a developed Bharat.\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "PM Modi Underscores India’s Tech Leap, AI Summit Success At News18 Rising Bharat 2026",
        "content": "Addressing the News18 Rising Bharat Summit on Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi articulated a transformative vision of India’s journey from a hesitant importer of technology to a dominant global exporter and trendsetter. Speaking at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi, the Prime Minister noted that the world is now “amazed\" by India’s digital infrastructure, which has bridged the gap between governance and the common citizen through the formidable “JAM Trinity\"—Jan Dhan, Aadhaar, and Mobile. This bedrock of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) has enabled the government to transfer a staggering Rs 24 lakh crore directly to beneficiaries via Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), effectively eliminating the “bitter truth\" of leakages that once plagued India’s welfare systems.\nThe Prime Minister highlighted that India’s leadership in digital payments is no longer just a regional success story but a global case study. He remarked that while ATMs arrived in India much later than in the developed world, the country has leapfrogged traditional banking hurdles to facilitate 20 billion digital transactions every month. This democratic spirit of technology ensures that 50 out of every 100 real-time digital transactions in the world now occur in India alone. This shift from a “consumer mindset\" to a “creator mindset\" was further exemplified by the recent India AI Impact Summit, where India was not merely a participant but a leader, shaping international standards for ethical and inclusive artificial intelligence.\nPrime Minister Modi emphasised that India is now setting new benchmarks in emerging technologies. He noted that a few years ago, initiatives hosted in India were often dismissed as regional matters; today, every major step taken in Bharat is analysed internationally. This rising global stature is a reflection of the “strength within\"—a realisation of national potential that has turned India into a hub for semiconductors, quantum computing, and scalable AI solutions. By moving from “Machine Learning\" to “Learning Machines\", India is ensuring that its MANAV vision for AI (Moral, Accountable, National, Accessible, and Valid) becomes a global blueprint for the common good.\nThe Prime Minister maintained that by stating that India is now a “Fast and Fearless\" nation, contributing nearly 20% to global growth. The transition from importing 2G and 3G technology to exporting indigenous 5G solutions and homegrown AI models signifies a sovereign digital future. For the global community, especially the Global South, the “India Stack\" has become a beacon of hope, proving that technology can be a means of equality rather than a source of divide. As India acts, the world watches, recognising that the nation is no longer just a part of the global dialogue—it is the one leading it.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday launched a scathing attack on Congress, referring to it as “India’s oldest party\" that tried to destroy India’s image at the AI Impact Summit, which concluded on February 21.\nCalling the shirtless protest at the AI summit by the Youth Congress a “dirty\" tactic, Prime Minister Modi said they deployed it a time when India is shaping the discourse in the age of artificial intelligence.\n“The AI summit was a moment of pride for the entire country, but the country’s oldest party tried to turn the national celebration into a spectacle. In front of foreign guests, the Congress not only exposed itself but also revealed its ideological bankruptcy,\" Modi said, during the News18 Rising Bharat Summit.\nModi took a swipe at the Congress’s “habit\" of protesting, saying when frustration and disappointment from failure fill the mind and arrogance takes over, thinking that defames the country comes to the surface. But he said no matter what, his government will keep doing its work.\n“Congress jitna shirt pharte rahe, hum apna kaam karte rahenge (no matter how many shirtless protests Congress carries out, we will keep doing our work),\" he said.\nRecalling Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s reference to Mahatma Gandhi over the shirtless protest, he said the grand old party always brings Bapu’s name forward to “hide its mistakes\".\n“There is anger in the country over this act of Congress. That is why, to justify their wrongdoing, they brought Mahatma Gandhi forward. The Congress party does the same thing whenever it wants to hide its mistakes — it brings Bapu to the forefront — and when it wants to claim credit, it gives all the recognition to one family (Nehru-Gandhi family),\" he said.\nListing the Congress’s opposition to Article 370, triple talaq, Swachh Bharat, Covid vaccine, surgical strikes, and the Ashoka stambh, the Prime Minister said the Congress has now been reduced to merely a “toolkit\" of the opposition in the name of ideology.\n“Congress opposed Ashoka stambh in Parliament, they opposed the new Parliament building, opposed the surgical strikes, air strikes, ‘Operation Sindoor. They opposed the CAA, women reservation Bill, UPI, opposed abolition of triple talaq. This mindset of blind opposition has grown so much that it does not miss any opportunity to belittle the country on any stage or platform,\" he said.\nGiving the example of the AI summit, however, Modi said nowadays any event hosted by India starts a global conversation but this was not the case before.\nHe said till a few years ago, events happening in India barely received serious attention in global media. Programmes and initiatives hosted in India were often seen as regional matters, not global ones, he added.\n“But look at the situation today. When India acts, the world watches. When India hosts an event, it becomes part of the global conversation. Every major step taken here is analysed internationally. Take the example of the AI summit. Under the leadership of Narendra Modi, India is not just participating in global technology discussions — it is helping shape them. The world is closely observing India’s initiatives in artificial intelligence, digital governance, and emerging technologies,\" he said.\nHe added that this transformation reflects India’s rising global stature and, today, India is not just part of the dialogue — it is helping lead it.\nLatest Blogs",

Even after Independence, India could not come out of the mentality of slavery. We are suffering the consequences of that till date,\" he said.\nThe prime minister, highlighting India’s expanding trade footprint, said the world’s leading economies are now eager to partner with India. “India is now so capable that developed countries of the world are themselves coming forward to make trade deals with India,\" he said. “Some people are not able to believe how India managed to do trade deals with developed countries.\"\nAccording to the prime minister, the answer lies in what he termed an “Aatmavishwaasi Bharat\"—a self-confident India that negotiates from a position of strength.\nHe added that India’s macroeconomic stability has strengthened its credibility. “We have made our banking system strong. We have controlled inflation which was once in double digits. We have made India the world’s growth engine,\" he said, asserting that global investors and governments view India as a reliable economic partner.\nPM Modi also pointed to India’s transformation in technology and digital governance as a factor behind rising global interest. “There was a time when India was just a consumer of technology.

        "content": "Former Singapore Foreign Minister George Yeo spoke about India’s role in current geopolitics at the News18 Rising Bharat Summit, where he underscored that everyone wants to build ties with New Delhi due to its rising political clout and economic growth.\nSpeaking to Firstpost’s Managing Editor Palki Sharma, Yeo said relations between India and China were key to regional peace in Asia, adding that India was in a good position globally as it was not a threat to any of the major powers in the world.\n“India is in a good position. India is not a threat to any of the major powers. Everyone wants good relations with India, including China. India has the privilege to sit at every table and enjoy the best,\" he said, when asked about current global uncertainties.\nYeo also appeared confident that all of India’s neighbours, including China, would want good relations with New Delhi in 10-20 years as it would be a “very good source of their own well-being\" and advantageous for them in the long run.\nYeo On India-China Relations\nThe former Singaporean FM said all of China’s neighbours wanted good investment, but they did not want to get too close to Beijing as they didn’t want it to dominate their lives. “China makes use of its economic position for statecraft. In 10-15 years, India will be in the same position in the continent.\"\nAn advocate of peaceful relations between India and China, Yeo said their relationship is key to regional peace, adding that while it is unlikely they will be too close, they do not have to be enemies.\nHe outlined key issues in India-China ties: politics and border security. However, he emphasised that China now understands that India is acting on its own behalf and its alliance with America is not aimed at countering Beijing.\nSelf-Sustaining Development In India\nYeo also asserted that India was on the trajectory for self-sustaining development, which he said was beneficial for Asia, Singapore and the world.\n“India went through a critical test in the last few months, when America piled on pressure. But India did not buckle. Its standing in the world has gone up. t made some tough decisions – to have an FTA with Europe, to undertake further internal reforms, and to move towards a situation where Indian talent is retained within India,\" he remarked.\nIndia’s IT Development & AI\nAlthough Yeo said India has become a major IT power in the world, he cautioned that artificial intelligence was a huge challenge for every nation. “The US and China are moving very fast. I think it’s good that India gave AI its full attention,\" he stated.\n“You (India) had a successful convention here a few weeks ago. You have identified the problems and opportunities, but moving with this technology requires the mobilisation of all people. It’s not just what a few computer scientists could do.\"\nHe also highlighted the use of technology for good and evil. “We have to be very mindful of the harm AI could do,\" he added. “Some societies can respond to new technologies better than others. They can exploit it, they can manage the problems.\"\nLatest Blogs",

In a country with many parties, castes, religions and ideologies, stability is maintained due to a strong judiciary,\" he said.\nHazare said that without an independent and effective judicial system, criminal elements would gain the upper hand, leading to chaos and unrest.

        "title": "Rising Bharat Summit | From Back-Offices To Nerve Centres: How GCCs Are Anchoring India’s Global Ambitions",
        "content": "The narrative of India as a mere “back-office\" for global corporations has been firmly dismantled at the News18 Rising Bharat Summit 2026. During a high-impact session titled “GCCs Ahoy! All roads lead to India\", industry leaders gathered at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi on February 27 to map out the meteoric rise of Global Capability Centres (GCCs). The discussion underscored a fundamental shift: India is no longer just providing labour; it is now the strategic “nerve centre\" where high-end R&D, autonomous vehicle technology, and AI-first products are conceived and owned.\nKaran Virwani, Chairperson, MD, and CEO of WeWork India, provided a striking metric for this growth, noting that GCCs now drive 40% of the Indian commercial real estate market. However, the physical expansion is merely a shadow of the intellectual growth occurring within those walls. Virwani highlighted that as digital transformation and AI adoption accelerate, the actual research and development—traditionally kept at global headquarters—is now happening in India. From innovation hubs to front-office functions, the sophisticated nature of the work being migrated is transforming the local talent landscape into a global front-runner.\nKiran Cherukuri, EVP and Global GCC Practice Head at HCLTech, revealed that the mandate for these centres has evolved from execution-based tasks to full product ownership. This transformation is being supercharged by artificial intelligence, with 65% of GCCs having already experimented with or fully rolled out AI pilots. This “AI-first\" approach is allowing Indian centres to transition from being recipients of instructions to becoming the primary architects of global enterprise platforms.\nThe rapid scaling of the sector has brought the challenge of talent retention to the forefront. Aravind Maiya, Co-Founder and CEO of EmbarkGCC, emphasised that as competition intensifies, “leadership depth\" becomes the critical differentiator. To maintain a standalone business in India, firms must offer more than just a job; they must provide a distinct culture and a clear global career path. Maiya predicted a significant rise in global roles being operated directly from India for multinational firms, further solidifying the country’s influence in international boardrooms.\nRohan Lobo, Partner and GCC Industry Leader at Deloitte South Asia, shared an optimistic outlook for the coming years, stating that approximately 5,000 firms are currently looking to establish GCCs in India. The scope of work is also expanding into futuristic sectors, with companies increasingly setting up autonomous vehicle operations within the country. While metro cities remain the primary hubs, Virwani noted that the next phase of growth will likely see a push into Tier-II markets, as firms seek to tap into a wider talent pool and manage rising operational costs in traditional urban centres.\nLatest Blogs",

Just because one Rahul does not understand, does not mean all Rahuls won’t understand. Some people are beyond understanding. I am not a person who will say like Shah Rukh Khan, “naam toh suna hi hoga\".\"\nIndia and the United States announced reaching a framework for an Interim Trade Agreement on February 2. The announcement followed a telephonic conversation between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and U.S. President Donald Trump. A formal joint statement detailing the framework was subsequently released by both governments on February 6–7. The U.S. agreed to slash reciprocal tariffs on Indian goods from 50% to 18%. This included removing a 25% penalty tariff previously imposed due to India’s purchase of Russian oil. The Indian government clarified that it has protected sensitive sectors like dairy and several key agricultural products from duty concessions.\nOn February 20, 2026, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a landmark 6–3 ruling in Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump, striking down the president’s sweeping “reciprocal tariffs\" as unlawful. The Court ruled that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the power to unilaterally impose tariffs. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the power to “regulate\" importation does not equate to the power to “tax,\" which remains an exclusive authority of Congress.\nThe picture with the key US officials on February 26 sparked a conversation around the deal.\nHosted US Secretary of Commerce @HowardLutnick & @USAmbIndia Sergio Gor.Engaged in very fruitful discussions to expand our trade and economic partnership. 🇮🇳🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/UjfExNj6wi\n— Piyush Goyal (@PiyushGoyal) February 26, 2026\nElaborating on the deal, Goyal said, “If you remember the lower court had ruled in May or June that IEEPA is not the mechanism which would sustain, but they were in appeal and it was a process that was simultaneously going. For us, the US is a very important trading partner. It is an important strategic relationship that encompasses our Quads, which covers our technological partnership. We are members of Pax Silica, which is our effort to create resilient supply chains. It is a very multifaceted relationship. There are so many opportunities. After all, we had a very successful AI summit at the same venue. If we are looking $200-billion investment in data centres and other AI associated ventures, if we are looking for opportunities for our men and women, we will need investments, technology, we will need GPUs, we will need equipment from the ICT world…these are partnerships… We have a lot of strategic interest in the pharmaceutical world…There are huge opportunities in our gems and jewellery and diamonds sectors…Our textiles will flourish.\"\n“… The US is an evolving situation. We are in dialogue with the administration in the US. We will have to wait and watch and ensure interests of India are protected. I want to assure that India stays committed to engaging for the best possible opportunities which were negotiated with the US for a deal that gives us competitive advantage,\" said Goyal.\n“Should the circumstances change, the deal will be rebalanced…The deal has many elements. There are so many positives. Trade deal or international trade is about comparative and competitive advantage. Trade deal is not about what the tariff is. It is about the advantage you get over competition. At 50% tariff, we were at huge disadvantage and the fact that we were able to bring it down to much lower than the rest of competition, was huge for India’s agriculture, handicrafts, diamonds, pharmaceuticals…India is on the move and our exports this year will be higher,\" he said.\nLatest Blogs",

He mentioned that he has his kids to look after and gets a limited salary. Once again, this incident has sparked debate on divorce, alimony, and gender-neutral laws in the country.\nIn the clip posted on X (formerly Twitter), the man told the court that he has been facing financial strain while raising his two children alone. He stated that both are minors and are currently in his custody. “There are two children, my Lord, and both are in my custody,\" he said.

Following this, his former wife allegedly admitted to having an affair with someone else and stated she would no longer continue to live with him. “She only left my company, and then I registered a police complaint on which she has stated that okay, she has an affair with someone else,\" he said.\nThe Man Said He Only Gets Rs 60,000 Monthly\nAs he was about to continue his statement, the judge interrupted and asked whether his ex-wife had demanded Rs 5,000 for rent and Rs 10,000 for living expenses.

        "content": "News18 Rising Bharat Summit 2026: Ranvir Sachdeva, the eight-year-old child prodigy who stole the spotlight at the India AI Impact Summit 2026, said that he hopes for the future anchored in “sovereign innovation, ethical AI, and inclusive impact.\"\nWhile speaking at the News18 Rising Bharat Summit 2026, he said, “I’m someone who’s about to witness eight decades of an independent India sometime soon. But you know what matters to me more? Will India be a 30 trillion dollar economy when I will be 30?\"\nPositioning his speech between “Rising Bharat in 2026\" and “Viksit Bharat in 2047,\" Sachdeva structured his narrative around two thoughts, opening with a couplet from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, “Kuch aisa nahi jo kar na sako, Kuch aisa nahi jo paa na sako.\"\nReferring to the India AI Mission’s roadmap, he underlined the importance of building a responsible AI ecosystem that is “accountable, sovereign, ethical, accessible and legitimate,\" bringing together technology giants, startups, scientists and students alike.\nWhile quoting Steve Jobs’s “You can never connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards,\" Sachdeva said that he has distilled two guiding principles from this – commitment over focus, and perseverance over fixed goals.\nHe also shared highlights of his journey, from presenting a three-minute IoT sensor project for public safety at age four, to authoring a book on artificial intelligence at six, and delivering a keynote at the AI for Good Global Summit at seven.\nDrawing an analogy from cricket practice, he said he “bleeds blue\" for the sport and believes in “playing on the front foot — whether in technology or cricket.\" His message to the audience was simple: “experience the sunrise, explore potential, and go the distance.\"\nConcluding with gratitude to the audience, he expressed hope that the “dots\" being created today would connect meaningfully by 2047, laying the foundation for a human-centric AI-driven Bharat.\n“Bharat ka anmol samay hai. Yehi samay hai, sahi samay hai,\" he said, urging collective action toward a stronger, future-ready India.\nSachdeva, the eight-year-old technologist and global author, made headlines after he attended the AI Impact Summit as the youngest keynote speaker.\nWhile speaking to news agency ANI after the summit, he explained that his address focused on how different nations are approaching artificial intelligence and how India is carving its own path in AI development.\nHe spoke confidently about innovation, indigenous AI models and the importance of technological self-reliance. His participation at the high-profile summit drew praise on social media, with many lauding his confidence and grasp of complex subjects at such a young age.\nEarlier, he was invited to the United Nations’ AI for Good Global Summit in Geneva, Switzerland, in 2025. There, he had confidently addressed over 10,000 attendees from more than 180 countries, 53 UN partner organisations, and global AI leaders. He spoke for 20 minutes on “Agents of Change: A 7-Year-Old’s Lens on Generation AI for Good\".\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "“Trust factor in deploying AI is important,\" Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said while addressing concerns over artificial intelligence and its impact on jobs at the News18 Rising Bharat Summit 2026. Emphasising India’s strengths in the technology sector, Vaishnaw argued that AI adoption would expand opportunities rather than diminish them — provided trust, talent and innovation move in tandem.\nAddressing fears of job losses, the minister said India’s IT industry has historically adapted to technological disruption. “The biggest strength of our IT sector is to be able to go to an enterprise, understand how it works and, based on that, provide a solution. It was demonstrated during the Y2K problem,\" he noted, recalling how Indian IT firms earned global credibility during the millennium bug crisis.\nHe underlined that trust will be central to AI integration in sensitive sectors such as banking and finance. “A bank would not want to hand over its coding to a software it doesn’t trust. That is where the role of IT companies will grow,\" he said. According to Vaishnaw, Indian technology firms are uniquely positioned to act as trusted partners in deploying AI systems securely and responsibly.\nAt the same time, he acknowledged the inevitability of disruption. “We need to scale up innovation in the AI sector. At the same time, we must be prepared for disruption due to the AI boost,\" he said, calling for proactive planning to manage workforce transitions. He stressed the importance of building a strong talent pipeline, adding that state governments must ensure colleges are reoriented to equip students with AI-focused skills and solution-driven training.\nSpeaking about the India AI Impact Summit, Vaishnaw described it as a global success. “The summit was well received and recognised globally. The format was more on the lines of World Economic Focus (WEF) Davos. It was designed in a way that the younger generation, who I call Gen Bharat, gets an opportunity to create their future in the way they want,\" he said, highlighting the focus on youth participation and solution-driven dialogue.\nOn funding, the minister was clear that India must increase investments. “We will have to scale up our investment on AI models,\" he said, signalling a push towards indigenous AI capabilities.\nHe also touched upon the evolving digital content ecosystem. “Content creators must get their fair share for creating content. Media houses should be rewarded accordingly for high-quality content,\" Vaishnaw said, underscoring the need for fair compensation in the AI-driven information economy.\nLatest Blogs",

His address will outline India’s long-term developmental roadmap, economic momentum, and strategic priorities in a rapidly shifting global order, while setting the tone for deliberations over the two-day gathering.\nOver the years, the Rising Bharat platform has evolved into a credible venue for substantive policy dialogue, and the 2026 edition signals sharper engagement around the ideas shaping India’s next phase of progress.

        "content": "Delhi Excise Policy Case News Live: Delhi’s Rouse Avenue Court on Friday discharged former Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, former Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and all other accused in the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) case linked to the alleged Delhi Excise Policy scam.\nKejriwal hailed the decision as “historic”, accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah of hatching a “conspiracy” to defame him and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). He said the court’s order confirmed that there was not an iota of evidence against him.\nMeanwhile, the CBI has approached the High Court, challenging the Rouse Avenue Court’s order discharging former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, former Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and all other accused in the alleged Excise Policy Scam case.\nThe court had earlier observed that the agency failed to present material sufficient to proceed against them. The order was passed by Special Judge Jitender Singh, who refused to frame charges in the corruption case, discharging all 23 accused persons.\n‘IMPLICATED WITHOUT MATERIAL’\nThe court noted that no prima facie case was made out against the accused and observed significant shortcomings in the prosecution’s case.\nWhile pronouncing the judgment, Arvind Kejriwal had been implicated without any cogent material linking him to the alleged offence.\nThe court held that it did not find any criminal conspiracy in the case and that the CBI’s allegations “lacked substance”.\nFollow for live updates\nDelhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta, reacting to legal relief to Arvind Kejriwal, said everyone knew the evidence in the liquor policy case had been tampered with. “This is the lower court’s decision…We all know how evidence (in liquor policy case) was tampered with,” she told reporters.\n“If you (Arvind Kejriwal) were right, then why did you withdraw the liquor policy as soon as the investigation started?…The courts had also expressed their worry on this case and traces of money laundering was found. Even today you are doing ‘nautanki’ (drama),” she added.\nShiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray commended Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia after they were discharged in the Delhi excise policy case and accused the Centre of defaming opposition leaders before elections. “We are very proud of Arvind Kejriwal and the case he has fought along with Manish Sisodia… The hope is that the BJP will apologise to Arvind Kejriwal, and the independence of the institution now remains,” he said.\nArvind Kejriwal slammed the Congress for its reaction to his discharge in the excise policy case, “Kejriwal went to jail. Did Robert Vadra go to jail? Sanjay Singh went to jail. Did Rahul Gandhi go to jail? Manish Sisodia went to jail. Did Sonia Gandhi ji went to jail? What is Congress saying? Does it have no shame?”\nThe Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has moved the Delhi High Court, challenging the Rouse Avenue Court’s order discharging former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and others in the liquor excise policy case, CBI sources told CNN-News18.\nReacting to Arvind Kejriwal’s discharge, BJP MP Manoj Tiwari said, “This is a decision of a lower court. The CBI is going to the higher court. All the evidence against the corrupt is solid, and we are confident that the criminals involved in the scams will lose.”\nBJP national spokesperson RP Singh said there are other corruption cases against AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal, which will go for trial. “As per the CAC report, there was scam in building roads, schools and hospitals, all these cases will be under trial,” he said.\nArvind Kejriwal challenged the BJP and PM Modi, saying if elections are held again in Delhi and the BJP wins over 10 seats, he will leave politics. “The people of Delhi are tired of your failures,” he said.\nArvind Kejriwal also said his mother was very sick and had to be admitted to a hospital while he was imprisoned in the excise policy case. He also said Manish Sisodia’s wife suffered from multiple sclerosis.\nIn a strong message to PM Modi, Kejriwal said, “You filed so many cases against us, you sent ED and CBI after us, you even sent us to jail, even then you could do nothing to Kejriwal. Now PM Modi has only one option, to kill Kejriwal. You have tried everything, now you would have to kill me.”\nArvind Kejriwal in his press conference also said he was repeatedly questioned why he disappeared from the public view after his bail, saying he preferred to keep quiet till his name was cleared of all charges.\n“I am an honest man, it affects me when someone calls me dishonest. It affects me when I am sent to jail and my family faces taunts. I had decided that I will keep quiet until I am proven innocent in front of the nation.”\nArvind Kejriwal said he had always led an honest life and never earned a single penny through dubious means, while accusing the BJP of defaming him. He said the court’s decision proved that he was “kattar imaandar”.\nAAP leader Arvind Kejriwal demanded an apology from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah, alleging that they hatched the “most disgusting conspiracy in independent India” to finish the Aam Aadmi Party.\nIn response to the acquittal of AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal, BJP MP Manan Kumar Mishra said, ”In crying and doing drama, Arvind Kejriwal is very good at it. What is the answer to this?”\nAAP leader Arvind Kejriwal said the Delhi court, in its 600-page order, said there is not the slightest evidence to even have a case on the liquor excise policy issue. He said the verdict of the court was “historic”, which exposed a conspiracy against him and the Aam Aadmi Party.\nArvind Kejriwal held a press conference on Friday, where he thanked the lawyers for his discharge in the Delhi excise policy case. He also attacked the BJP and central agencies, accusing them of ‘conspiring’ to finish the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) through a false case.\nRJD leader Tejashwi Yadav claimed that central agencies were filing cases against opposition leaders and accused the BJP of defaming people. “The court has also said that a case should be filed against the CBI’s IO (investigating officer) as well. Agencies keep filing cases against opposition parties in the wrong manner. The BJP uses this to defame people. We too have faith in the judiciary that in the coming times, we will also get justice,” he told reporters.\nCongress spokesperson Shama Mohamed questioned how the evidence against Arvind Kejriwal in the Delhi liquor policy case had disappeared. “Let’s understand certain things. No one has said that one is innocent. They’re saying there is no evidence… There was evidence before; suddenly, the evidence has disappeared,” she said.\nAam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Atishi on Friday said that Arvind Kejriwal’s honesty is before entire nation.\n“Arvind Kejriwal’s ‘kattar imaandaari’ is before the entire nation today… On one side, it is the BJP’s conspiracy, hunger for power and misuse of central agencies; on the other side is Arvind Kejriwal’s and AAP’s honesty,” she said.\n#WATCH | Delhi | On Arvind Kejriwal’s acquittal in excise policy case, AAP leader Atishi says, “Arvind Kejriwal’s ‘kattar imaandaari’ is before the entire nation today…On one side, it is the BJP’s conspiracy, hunger for power and misuse of central agencies; on the other side is… pic.twitter.com/HPEPLd6DGk\n— ANI (@ANI) February 27, 2026\nReacting to the acquittal of Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and other accused in the liquor policy case, the wife of AAP leader Sanjay Singh called it a big day, adding that “everyone is very happy.”\n“This is a big day for AAP and our family.

        "content": "Union Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia on Thursday strongly criticised the Indian Youth Congress (IYC) for staging a shirtless protest during the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, terming the disruption “an unmitigated disaster\" at a global platform meant to showcase India’s technological leadership. Speaking at the News18 Rising Bharat Summit 2026, Scindia said the summit represented India’s national interest and was not a party event.\nMembers of the Indian Youth Congress gathered outside the high-security venue and staged a dramatic shirtless protest, raising slogans and attempting to march toward the site where global leaders and delegates had assembled. With over two dozen heads of state and international representatives in attendance, security was heightened. Delhi Police detained and later arrested several protesters for breaching barricades and attempting to disrupt the proceedings.\nReacting to the incident, Scindia said, “It was an unmitigated disaster. The AI Impact Summit was not a BJP programme. It was Bharat’s programme. You had 26 heads of state visiting India because everyone realises India is the next growth potential in the world.\" He argued that protests of this nature at an international forum damaged the country’s image at a time when India is emerging as a major technology and innovation hub.\nIn a sharp political swipe, he added, “If you want to exhibit the vacuousness of desh bhakti, then good luck to you. India has rejected you multiple times. It is the people in that arena there that took these people down,\" asserting that electoral mandates had already delivered their verdict.\nOn Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Scindia was brief, saying, “I have nothing to say to Rahul Gandhi.\" However, responding to Gandhi’s criticism of the India-US trade deal, he said, “If you are so anti your own country in your own mind, then I don’t think this country has any place for you.\"\nScindia positioned the controversy as a clash between India’s global ambitions and what he described as disruptive political theatrics.\nThe News18 Rising Bharat Summit 2026 is a two-day national platform hosted in New Delhi that brings together political leaders, policymakers, industry captains, innovators, thinkers and cultural voices to spotlight India’s expanding role on the global stage and chart the country’s future trajectory across technology, policy, trade, culture and social development.\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "Rising Bharat Summit 2026 Highlights: PM Modi Slams TMC, Says Ayushman Bharat Scheme Not Implemented In Bengal",
        "content": "News18 Rising Bharat Summit 2026 Day 1 Highlights: Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the News18 Rising Bharat Summit 2026, which brought together top national leadership and international delegates at Bharat Mandapam on February 27, Friday, reflecting the confidence and capabilities driving India’s rise.\nDuring the speech, PM Modi hailed the nation’s internal strength and said that the country has realised its potential in the last 11 years.\nBuilt around the theme — “Strength Within” — the two-day summit brings together leaders, policymakers, and industry voices to shape a future powered by India’s own resolve and ambition. This is where national purpose meets global ambition, transforming resilience into a roadmap for excellence on the world stage.\nAmong the other dignitaries were: Union Ministers Piyush Goyal, Ashwini Vaishnaw,  and Jyotiraditya Scindia, among others.\nAddressing the gathering, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, “Ayushman Bharat scheme has not been implemented in Bengal till today.”\nHe added, “If the intention had been sincere, this scheme providing free treatment up to ₹5 lakh for the poor would not have been stopped in Bengal.”\nReferring to housing initiatives, he said, “Under the PM Awas Yojana, permanent houses are being built for the poor across the country.”\nCiting Tamil Nadu, PM Modi said, “In Tamil Nadu, 9.5 lakh permanent houses have been allotted to poor families, but construction of 3 lakh houses has stalled because the DMK government is not taking interest in building homes for the poor.”\nHe concluded, “Because the intention is not sincere.”\nAddressing the role of the opposition in a democracy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, “In democracy, the role of the opposition is not just about blind opposition but about presenting an alternative vision. That is why the enlightened public of the country is teaching a lesson to Congress.”\nAddressing the gathering, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, “A nation’s progress is determined not by today’s comforts, but by preparation for tomorrow. The hard work done with foresight is the foundation of a self-reliant, strong, and prosperous India by 2047. And no matter how much the Congress may protest, we will continue working relentlessly.”\nContinuing his criticism, PM Modi said, “There is anger in the country over this act of Congress. That is why, to justify their wrongdoing, they brought Mahatma Gandhi forward. The Congress party does the same thing whenever it wants to hide its mistakes — it brings Bapu to the forefront — and when it wants to claim credit, it gives all the recognition to one family.”\nHe also said, “In the name of ideology, Congress has now been reduced to merely a ‘toolkit’ of opposition. This mindset of blind opposition has grown so much that it does not miss any opportunity to belittle the country on any stage or platform.”\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi launched a sharp attack on Congress over its protest during the AI Summit, calling it an attempt to undermine a moment of national pride. He said, “The AI Summit was a moment of pride for the entire country, but the country’s oldest party tried to turn the national celebration into a spectacle. In front of foreign guests, Congress not only exposed itself but also revealed its ideological bankruptcy.”\nHe further added, “When frustration and disappointment from failure fill the mind and arrogance takes over, such thinking that defames the country comes to the surface.”\nAddressing the Rising Bharat Summit 2026, Prime Minister Narendra Modi criticised Congress over its shirtless protest during the AI Summit. He said, “incidents like this occur due to a mindset of arrogance, which is portrayed by Congress,” linking the episode to what he described as a larger pattern of behaviour.\nSpeaking at the Rising Bharat event, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, “there was a time when india was just a consumer of a technology, but today india is manufacturing it.” He further added, “There was a time when India was importer of new technologies, now we are exporter of new technology.”\nHighlighting India’s infrastructure growth, PM Modi said, “world is amazed with our digital infrastructure.” He also noted, “India has world third largest metro network,” pointing to rapid urban and connectivity expansion.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi said, “When the hidden strength within a nation awakens, it achieves new accomplishments.” He underlined the importance of national confidence and collective resolve in driving progress.\nAddressing the Rising Bharat event, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, “India is now so capable that developed countries of the world are themselves coming forward to make trade deals with India.” He emphasised growing global confidence in India’s economic strength and expanding international partnerships.\nHighlighting India’s growing global economic engagement, PM Modi said, “countries are coming forward to do trade deal with india,” underscoring rising international interest in partnering with India.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi asserted that “We have made india world’s growth engine.” He also said, “we have controled the inflation which was in double digit,” pointing to efforts aimed at stabilising the economy.\nSpeaking at the Rising Bharat event, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, “In the last 11 years, energy has flowed into the consciousness of the country.” He added that “we have made our banking system strong,” highlighting structural reforms undertaken during this period.\nSpeaking about India’s growing global standing, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, “some people are not able to believe how india managed to do trade deals with developed countries.” He explained, “why are developed countries so eager to do trade deal with india…answer is aatma vishwasi bharat,” attributing the interest to a confident and self-assured India.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi said, “Even after independence, India could not come out of the mentality of slavery. We are suffering the consequences of this till date.” He further added, “unfortunately after independence india could not come out of colonial mindset, because of which we are suffering even today,” highlighting the long-term effects of that mindset.\nAddressing the Rising Bharat event, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, “we want to recognise our capabilities and strength.” He noted that in the past, “we use to copy foreign countries technology,” stressing the need for greater self-reliance and confidence in India’s own potential.\n“We want to recognise our capabilities and strength,” PM Modi said. “We use to copy foreign countries technology,” he added.\nPM Modi said that the Summit focuses on the “internal strength of the nation,” adding that India has realised its strength in the last 11 years.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi will address the Rising Bharat Summit 2026 shortly.\nAt a time when India’s global identity is being shaped not just by economic policy but by cinema, sport and culture, conversations around storytelling have also evolved. At the News18 Rising Bharat Summit 2026, themed Strength Within, actor Yami Gautam addressed whether her choice of politically charged films ever cost her professional opportunities.\nIf Congress wants to save itself, it must look for a better face, Bollywood actor and Mandi MP Kangana Ranaut said at the Rising Bharat Summit on Friday, calling out Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi’s behaviour in political life.\nResponding to the question — “Kabhi aapke saath aisa nahi hua ki certain film makers said main aapko cast karta but you did that film toh uske baad I don’t want to cast you?” — Yami offered a candid reflection.\n“Our relation go long back in time. We follow development in India very closely. India is now on the trajectory of self sustaining development,” said Singapore politician George Yeo on India-Singapore relations.\nSpeaking at the News18 Summit, “BJP MP Kangana Ranaut on Friday said,”We learn from Rahul Gandhi what not to do and how not to become. Somewhere Rahul Gandhi has lost his mind. Behaving like this, taking off clothes in that manner.”\n“After Independence, Mahatma Gandhi had said that Congress should be dissolved, but Nehru ji did not listen to him. I feel that now Rahul Gandhi is fulfilling that dream — he is showing how to completely destroy Congress. His behaviour in Parliament is like that of a tapori (street ruffian),” she said.\nVeteran actor Anil Kapoor reflects on his remarkable 45-year journey in the film industry, sharing insights into his enduring appeal, disciplined fitness routine, and the mindset that keeps him energized and relevant even today.\n#RisingBharat2026 | ‘It’s been a journey of discovering and learning’\nAnil Kapoor (@AnilKapoor) shares his timeless appeal, fitness secrets, and what keeps him energized after 45 years in the industry. #AnilKapoor #News18 | @KishoreAjwani pic.twitter.com/smqhmOPr9Y\n— News18 (@CNNnews18) February 27, 2026\nResponding to a question, Yami Gautam said, “I am fortunate, in the last 5–6 years the kind of work I have received connected me with the audience in a way, I really value that sentiment. Somewhere, that inspires me to do better work. We are not in competition with each other. We need to stand together as an Indian film industry and present ourselves to the world that we are ready. Keeping that in mind, I do as much work as I can, nothing beyond that.”\nActor and politician Khushbu Sundar praised the film Dhurandhar, calling it one of the finest cinematic experiences in recent times.\n“For me, Dhurandhar was one of the best films ever made in recent times. It was a long one, 3 and a half hours, so I was told the movie is too long. But then I have my two young girls; they said, “Mummy, go and watch this in theater.” And I didn’t realise how 3.5 hours passed.\nSpeaking about people calling films an agenda, Swanand Kirkire said, “I don’t understand why you are watching a movie assuming there is an agenda. A film is a medium of entertainment — why aren’t you looking for an agenda in other things?\nIf that is the case, then when a poor girl falls in love with a rich boy, is that also an agenda? If an inter-caste marriage is shown on screen, is that too an agenda?\n“Govt has said 30-35 per cent of the vehicles will be electrified by 2030. India’s driven solar manufacturing in India to the size and scale that is unbelievable. It is now driving in a very big way critical mineral processing and the battery manufacturing PLI in India,” said Former NITI Ayog CEO Amitabh Kant.\nAmitabh Kant, former CEO, NITI Ayog believed urbanisation must become the key driver of India’s growth story.\n“There are 46 per cent people in agriculture, which is too high, it will drag down the productivity. You need to take away people from agriculture into manufacture and from manufacturing to exports. Manufacturing led urbanization is the key,” he said .\n“Today we have 315 universities across India where students are using the world’s most advanced EDA tool. And compare globally, outside India there are not even 20 universities where students will get end to end capability of designing a chip, manufacturing it, and using it in a module,” said Ashwini Vaishnaw.\nUnion Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Friday spoke about AI diffusion in India and said, “If you look at all the economies, we have probably highest AI diffusion rate both in the consumer sector and in the enterprise sector. It is actually giving us big strength. The IT sector is working rapidly towards providing AI services, and in consumer sector lots and lots of creators are coming up. So ofcourse it is happening.”\nSpeaking at the News18 Rising Bharat Summit, BJP’s Shudhanshu Tiwari said, “Today, India is leading the AI summit and has become the world’s number 1 country in digital transactions, and if we look at it, in iPhone manufacturing, it stands at number 2 after China.”\nAt the News18 Rising Bharat Summit 2026, Winselow Tucker, President & GM, Eli Lilly India, will address the urgent need to reframe obesity from stigma to science.

We were little bit left behind. ]Everybody felt that energy transition, something that we easily adopted, that will take over and leave behind a lot of these other sectors. That’s completely changed and globally there is huge demand for energy whether it’s oil or gas, AND along with renewable power and other things. We found ourselves at a place where we can really contribute strength in building assets and bringing it up to the scale and making it operational.”\nHe stressed that the renewed global demand across oil, gas, renewable power and core infrastructure has created fresh opportunities for businesses with proven strengths in asset building and operational scale.\nUnion Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said at the Rising Bharat Summit that two more semiconductor plants will soon be announced following the Micron Technology project in India.\nIndia’s economy is undergoing significant changes, driven by reforms and renewed global engagement, according to Rajiv Memani, Chairman and CEO of EY India.\nSpeaking about the country’s performance in the last few months amid rising global competitiveness and back-to-back trade deals, Memani identified three major shifts over the past 12 months.\n“If you look up to last 12 months and if you were to pick up 3 big changes, I’d say first one is this period which reforms are happening.”\nHe stressed that reforms are critical for scaling up and improving the ease of doing business across sectors.\n“And for scaling up, it is critical doing business. lots of sectors, if you reflect back three years, were not there. those sectors are there. And govt is putting a lot of pressure in all sectors whether it is on data centres, electronics, nuclear, medical devices. You can go on and on.”\nMemani also pointed to India’s increasing global engagement through trade agreements as another major development.\n“Second is the way India is now reengaging globally through FTA, bilateral agreements, I think that’s fantastic.”\n“Instead of just using AI, we should work on developing them”\nThe 8-year-old coder @ranvirsachdeva shares his vision for rising Bharat with @KuheenaSharma #RisingBharatSummit2026 #TechNews #Coding pic.twitter.com/pOVaZlY1gy\n— News18 (@CNNnews18) February 27, 2026\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "The “superfast\" mission looks a step closer for Indian Railways, which has undertaken a modernisation initiative to facilitate high-speed travel up to 160 kmph.\nThis will be reflected in how the railways manages its traffic: a move towards fewer trackside signals and a significant increase in the distance between them, as well as thorough Kavach implementation.\nAccording to a report published by the Times of India, to ensure the safety of these faster journeys, the Railway Board has approved a proposal to double the distance between signals from the current 1 km to 2 km.\nThe report said this adjustment is a vital safety enhancement, as when the trains reach speeds of 160 kmph, the physics of braking dramatically change. This will require a longer stretch of track to decelerate and make a safe stop.\nIt said by spacing signals 2 km apart, the railways will provide locomotive pilots with a longer braking window and earlier warnings. Experts said this will significantly reduce the need for the abrupt, sudden braking that can compromise both safety and passenger comfort.\nThe Times of India reported that before this is implemented across the vast national network, it will undergo rigorous testing. A pilot project managed by Southern Railway has been given the “green light\" to prepare a detailed proposal for the Railway Board.\nIt said if this pilot proves successful in maintaining safety while facilitating higher speeds, the system is expected to be rolled out nationwide with other zones like the North Central Railway already identified for future expansion. This initiative has been solidified following high-level consultations between the additional member (traction) and zonal principal chief electrical engineers, culminating in a pivotal meeting on January 27, where the 2-km spacing was officially suggested.\nThe shift away from traditional trackside (or “wayside\") signals represents a major technological leap.\nHistorically, the railways has relied on physical signals — essentially sophisticated “traffic lights\" on poles — that a locomotive pilot must visually spot. This system, however, will prove to be a hurdle as the network aims for higher speeds.\nAt speeds exceeding 130 kmph, the “sighting distance\" — the time between a driver seeing a signal and reaching it — becomes dangerously short. This problem is worsened by external factors such as heavy rain, sharp curves, or the thick fog common in North India, which often forces drivers to slow down because they cannot see the signal clearly.\nTo overcome these constraints, the railways is transitioning to “cab signalling\". Under this system, the signal aspect (red, yellow, or green) is directly displayed on a screen inside the locomotive cockpit.\nThis allows the train to maintain its top speed regardless of external visibility or weather conditions, effectively moving the “intelligence\" of the railway from the ground into the train.\nThe primary driver of speed upgrade is the implementation of Kavach, India’s indigenous automatic train protection (ATP) system, alongside ETCS Level 2 (European Train Control System).\nKavach acts as an electronic “shield\", creating a digital communication bubble around every train to prevent collisions. The system operates through a sophisticated “digital handshake\" between several components.\nThis allows the railways to move from “fixed blocks\" — where only one train can occupy a set section of track — to optimised or “moving\" blocks. By knowing the exact position and braking distance of every train via radio communication, the gap between trains can be safely reduced, allowing more trains to run at higher speeds without waiting for a physical “all clear\" from a distant pole.\nKavach also introduces continuous speed supervision. Unlike physical signals, which are “static\" and only tell a driver to “stop\" or “go\", it provides a continuous speed curve.\nThe system calculates the train’s weight, the track’s gradient, and the distance to the next restriction to determine the exact moment braking is required. If a conflict is detected, Kavach initiates a three-stage safety protocol.\nAdditionally, it includes a network-wide SOS feature. If an accident occurs, a pilot can press an SOS button, sending a radio signal that automatically slows or stops every other train within a several-kilometre radius, preventing secondary collisions on adjacent tracks.\nBeyond speed and safety, reducing trackside signals offers significant cost and maintenance benefits.\nPhysical signal posts are expensive to install and prone to failure, theft, or damage. Each signal requires extensive wiring, power, and individual maintenance.\nBy contrast, it is far more cost-effective to maintain a network of radio towers for Kavach and ETCS than thousands of individual signal lamps and hundreds of kilometres of copper signalling cables. This reduction in a “signal failure\" is expected to significantly improve the punctuality of the network.\nAs of February, the rollout of Kavach 4.0 has significantly accelerated. The project is focused on two critical high-speed corridors under ‘Mission Raftar’.\nAccording to the ministry of railways, the vendor base has expanded to over five companies in 2026, shifting the pace from experimental to mass production. With over 1,300 route kilometres already commissioned and more than 4,150 locomotives fitted with Kavach, the full activation of this system remains the final “permission slip\" needed to officially raise the speed limit to 160 kmph across these vital corridors.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "The Assam Cabinet has decided to formally approach the Gauhati High Court seeking the constitution of a fast-track court to hear the high-profile death case of popular Assamese singer Zubeen Garg. The move follows mounting public pressure and demands from the singer’s family for a speedy trial.\nAnnouncing the decision after a Cabinet meeting on February 26, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said the state government would request the Chief Justice of the Gauhati High Court to facilitate day-to-day hearings to ensure swift justice.\n“The Assam Cabinet has decided to recommend or formally request the Gauhati High Court to constitute a fast-track court for the trial in the death case of popular Assamese singer Zubeen Garg. This move aims to expedite proceedings and ensure timely, day-to-day hearings for swift justice,\" Sarma said.\nThe case has drawn widespread attention across Assam, with opposition parties, civil society organisations, and prominent individuals repeatedly demanding faster judicial progress. A regional political party had also announced plans to launch an agitation over delays in the case.\nHowever, some political voices have raised concerns over whether shifting the matter to a fast-track court could have implications for bail conditions or ongoing legal proceedings.\nIn a related development, the Gauhati High Court has ordered the reopening of a packaged drinking water unit linked to Siddharth Sarma, one of the prime accused in the case. Sarma, who served as Garg’s manager, faces allegations of mismanagement and alleged misappropriation of the singer’s funds.\nThe water plant Mahavir Aqua (also referred to as Mahabir Aqua) — located in an industrial area near Guwahati, had been sealed by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) during the probe. Investigators suspect that funds allegedly siphoned from Garg were invested in the business, citing it as part of the possible motive in the case.\nA Public Interest Litigation (PIL) seeking the reopening of the plant was filed by Sarma’s associate, Chetan Dhirasia. The matter was heard on February 25, 2026.\nIn its order, the court observed that public welfare-oriented business operations should not remain indefinitely shut due to ongoing criminal proceedings against an individual. The bench stressed the need to balance the interests of justice with broader community and economic considerations.\nMeanwhile, Siddharth Sarma, event manager Shyamkanu Mahanta, co-signer Amritprabha Mahanta, accompanist Sekhar Goswami, and other accused individuals remain in judicial custody.\nObservers noted that during recent court appearances, the accused appeared composed, with no visible display of remorse.\nThe case continues to generate significant public and political interest as calls grow louder for a time-bound trial and accountability.\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "New Book Delves Into Ancient Hindu Glory, Seeks To Rekindle The 'Flame Of Resistance'",
        "content": "At a time when debates around India’s civilisational past are often framed through the lens of decline and disruption, a new book seeks to shift the narrative towards rediscovering lost grandeur and drawing lessons for the future. The Decline of the Hindu Civilisation by Shashi Ranjan Kumar reconstructs the intellectual brilliance, scientific achievements and spiritual depth of ancient India, arguing that the civilisation’s enduring “flame of resistance\" ensured its continued relevance despite repeated upheavals. Rather than dwelling solely on decay, the book positions the past as a source of renewal — suggesting that the road ahead lies in understanding and reclaiming civilisational confidence.\nA senior civil servant and an electrical engineering graduate from Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, Kumar writes that his journey began when he read VS Naipaul’s India: A Wounded Civilisation. The book, he says, unsettled his early understanding of Hindu civilisation. But as he turned to primary sources and comparative historical study, Kumar came to see the “wound\" not as fatal, but as a reminder of resilience — a civilisational continuity that refused to be extinguished. Through deep research and comparisons with other great cultures, he examines whether internal rigidities, political fissures or external invasions best explain periods of decline, even as he foregrounds the enduring strength that survived them.\nStructured in four parts and sixteen chapters, the book re-evaluates Indian history from what Kumar describes as an indigenous perspective, challenging colonial and Marxist frameworks. The first part, comprising eight chapters, offers a comparative study of ancient Indian, Greco-Roman and Chinese civilisations. It draws parallels between institutions such as Nalanda and Alexandria, and devotes detailed chapters to astronomy, mathematics and medicine. Kumar revisits the “sciences of the Hindus,\" comparing Indian cosmological models with Greek thought, and highlighting contributions such as Aryabhata’s astronomical insights, the formalisation of zero, and the early foundations of calculus developed by the Kerala school.\nThe book also addresses civilisational self-perception. Kumar argues that “Bharat\" — or the Idea of India — is not a 19th-century construct but finds clear articulation in ancient texts such as the Puranas, which describe a culturally unified geography. He challenges the claim that “Hinduism\" was merely a British-era invention, contending instead that it represents a long-standing civilisational continuum. According to him, India’s historical trajectory is marked by wounds that “refuse to heal,\" accompanied by what he calls a stubborn denial of past humiliations. Yet this very continuity, he suggests, is proof of resilience rather than rupture.\nA substantial section of the book analyses five key battles — from the Battle of Hydaspes to the Battle of Assaye — to understand recurring military setbacks. Kumar attributes these to tactical inflexibility, lack of political unity and delayed adaptation to changing technologies of warfare. He also contests Sheldon Pollock’s thesis on the “death of Sanskrit,\" arguing that Sanskrit intellectual culture remained vibrant in regions such as the Sena and Gahadavala kingdoms until the onset of foreign invasions.\nDrawing comparisons with the Roman, Greco-Roman and Chinese civilisations, Kumar notes that while several great empires collapsed or were entirely replaced, Hindu civilisation retained a living core. That persistent “flame of resistance,\" he argues, prevented total extinguishment and preserved cultural memory through centuries of turmoil.\nThe book ultimately returns to its central proposition: that the past is not merely a chronicle of defeats but a reservoir of inspiration. By revisiting ancient achievements and honestly examining historical setbacks, Kumar suggests that India can shape a future worthy of its civilisational inheritance — one that generations to come will regard with pride.\nLatest Blogs",

It is a very strategic port. If fully developed, it can play a very important role in connecting India through Iran to Central Asia, to the Caucasus, and then to Europe,\" the Iranian minister was quoted by India Today.\nThe Iranian minister added that the port can probably act as the best transit route. “I hope that one day we can witness the full development of this port,\" he said.\nWith huge strategic importance, the Chabahar Port project is being developed by India at Chabahar in southeastern Iran. The port will open immense opportunities towards creating direct trade and transit route to Afghanistan and Central Asia while bypassing Pakistan.\nThe port will help India increase its regional connectivity, boost trade access to landlocked Central Asian markets, counter China’s influence in Pakistan’s Gwadar Port, and strengthen India’s geopolitical presence in the region.\nHowever, amid renewed tensions between the US and Iran, this year’s Union Budget marks the first time since India signed a deal to develop the port in 2024 that no allocation has been made for the project.\nNotably, India in previous budgets had earmarked Rs 100 crore annually for the major connectivity project in Iran’s southern Sistan-Balochistan province, where it continues to remain a key development partner.\nLatest Blogs",

Uncertainty persists in citizens’ minds over the exact dates for the festivities of Holika Dahan and Dhulandi.

However, since official holiday announcements across various states have been different from each other, uncertainty remains.\nIn certain North-Western and Central states, the festivities and puja rituals for the Holika Dahan will be hosted on March 2. The occasion will fall on the next day in the other parts of the region, with the Dhulandi celebrated the following morning.\nIn Uttar Pradesh, there is a different kind of confusion about the festivities and overall Holi celebrations this time. The state government had announced that students can enjoy a prolonged observance of the festival in the first week of March.\nMarch 1, 2026, falls on a Sunday and is a regular weekly holiday for school students, according to the annual academic calendar released by the State Education Department. In certain schools, March 2 will see a close due to Holika Dahan and March 4 has been announced a holiday for the celebrations of Dhulandi.\nSince Holika Dahan is generally observed one day before the Holi festivities, there is confusion whether the UP government will also have March 3rd as a public holiday.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "A family in Madhya Pradesh’s Sehore has claimed that the then British government failed to repay a loan of Rs 35,000 taken during the First World War in 1917 and is now exploring legal options to recover  what they describe as a historic sovereign debt with interest\nThe family of late businessman Seth Jumma Lal Ruthia claimed that he lent Rs 35,000 to the British administration in 1917 during the First World War, as per a report by News18 Hindi. At the time, the amount was considered substantial and was reportedly provided to support wartime administration in the princely state of Bhopal.\nNow, more than a century later, Seth Jummalal’s grandson, Vivek Ruthia, said he is preparing to send a legal notice to the British government to recover the loan which was never repaid. He said that the documentary evidence of the transaction was recently discovered among old family records following his father’s death.\nThe document, dated June 4, 1917, stated that Seth Jumma Lal, of the firm Seth Rama Kishan Jaskaran Ruthia, “subscribed Rs 35,000 to the Indian War Loan and thereby showed his loyalty to the Government and Empire.\" It beares the signature of W S Davis, who was then the political agent in Bhopal.\nWar loans during that period were debt instruments issued by the British government to raise funds for military expenses during World War I, typically offering 5.5% interest.\nSeth Jummalal Ruthia died in 1937, nearly 20 years after the loan was extended. The matter, the family claimed, remained unsettled and gradually slipped into obscurity until now.\nRuthia said that he is consulting lawyers to explore whether a claim can be made against the current UK government.\n“It’s not just about money, it’s about justice and history,\" he said, adding that when adjusted for compound interest, inflation or gold prices, the original Rs 35,000 could now be worth several crores of rupees.\nThe Ruthia family was once among the most prominent and affluent in Sehore and the Bhopal princely state, with significant landholdings and business interests. Seth Jumma Lal Ruthia was a prominent trader in cloth and grain in Sehore during British rule. At the time of World War I, when the colonial administration was facing financial strain, local officials reportedly approached him for assistance.\nThey family continues to own property in Sehore, Indore and Bhopal.\nLegal experts note that claims involving pre-Independence transactions between colonial authorities and private individuals are rare and legally complex. While no legal notice has yet been sent, the family said that it is determined to pursue the matter.\nLatest Blogs",

India has put 45 Special Forces personnel on the ground, soldiers trained for high-altitude infiltration through HALO and HAHO jumps, covert reconnaissance, and counter-terrorism operations in terrain that defeats most conventional units.\nTraining with them are 12 soldiers from the US Army’s Green Berets, specifically one full Operational Detachment Alpha, or ODA. An ODA is the core unit of Green Beret operations, with each soldier holding a specialist role in weapons, medicine, communications, or engineering. The exercise is focussed on joint mission planning, tactical drills, and building the kind of trust that makes two different armies function as one.\nAlongside “Vajra Prahar\", Exercise Dharma Guardian 2026 is also underway at the Foreign Training Node in Chaubattia, Uttarakhand. This is the 7th edition of India’s joint military exercise with Japan and will continue till March 9.\nIndian Army troops and soldiers from the Japanese Ground Self-Defence Force are working through counterinsurgency and jungle warfare drills, reinforcing a defence relationship that has been picking up real momentum in recent years.\nDown south, Exercise “Kalari Leap\" was held across the Lakshadweep and Minicoy archipelago, with landings at by special forces teams at Agatti airport. This was a high-tempo joint maritime exercise involving the Indian Air Force’s Southern Air Command, the Armed Forces Special Operations Division, and the Indian Coast Guard.

Within hours of its release, the book was taken off the council’s website and all physical circulation was stopped after the SC expressed its “ire\" over the content, which it deemed defamatory and an affront to the integrity of the legal system.\nA three-judge bench, comprising Chief Justice of India Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi, took suo motu cognisance of the “objectionable\" statements regarding the judiciary. The matter was brought to the court’s attention for urgent consideration by senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Abhishek Singhvi.\nDuring the proceedings, CJI Surya Kant issued a stern warning stating that “nobody on earth will be allowed to defame the judiciary and taint its integrity\".\nIn a swift response, the NCERT released a statement acknowledging that “certain inappropriate textual material and error of judgement have inadvertently crept into\" Chapter 4, titled ‘The Role of Judiciary in our Society’.\nIt said the inclusion of such material was “purely unintentional\" and expressed deep regret for the oversight. The ministry of education, through the department of school education and literacy, intervened in the matter and ordered the distribution of the textbook to be on “strict hold\" until further notice.\nThe NCERT further said it holds the judiciary in the “highest esteem\", viewing the institution as the “upholder of the Indian Constitution and protector of Fundamental Rights\". It said the primary objective of its new textbooks is to “strengthen constitutional literacy, institutional respect, and informed understanding of democratic participation amongst students\", rather than questioning the authority of constitutional bodies.\nThe controversial chapter had listed corruption, along with a massive backlog of cases and an inadequate number of judges, as significant challenges currently facing the Indian judicial system.\nTo rectify the situation, the NCERT has announced that the curriculum will be completely rewritten. This process will involve close consultation with “appropriate authorities\" to ensure the material is accurate and respectful of the country’s institutions.\nThe revised version of the textbook is expected to be made available to Class 8 students in time for the commencement of the 2026-27 academic session.\nThe textbook noted that judges are bound by a code of conduct and that mechanisms exist to address complaints, including the Centralised Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System, which received over 1,600 complaints between 2017 and 2021.\nIt also explained that Parliament has the authority to impeach judges after due inquiry in cases of serious misconduct. The book stated that corruption experienced at various levels of the judiciary could affect access to justice, particularly for disadvantaged sections and highlighted efforts to improve transparency.\nThe previous Class 8 textbook published by NCERT explained the structure, role and independence of the judiciary but did not mention corruption as a challenge.\nLatest Blogs",
