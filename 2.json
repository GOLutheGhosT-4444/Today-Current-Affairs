Nair in New Delhi.\n| Photo Credit: Sushil Kumar Verma\nSimultaneous polls are crucial from an economic standpoint, according to P.P. Chaudhary, BJP MP and chairperson of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) examining the Bill on concurrent elections. In a wide-ranging conversation at The Hindu MIND event moderated by Sobhana K. Nair, he, however, admitted that the Constitution (129th Amendment) Bill, 2024, in its present form has many infirmities, including excessive power to the Election Commission (EC), which needs to be addressed. Edited excerpts:\nThe JPC on simultaneous polls has had 16 meetings consulting a wide array of witnesses, including six former Chief Justices of India. You have made your support for the legislation very clear. Why do you believe India needs to synchronise its election cycle?\nThis reform is necessary from an economic standpoint to prevent wastage of manpower and to avoid disruption of investment. ‘One nation, one election’ is key for ‘Viksit Bharat’. In Uttarakhand, for instance, tourism accounts for 43% of the State’s revenue and operates effectively for only four months. An election held in April-May during this window severely disrupts the economy. Nationwide, separate voter lists for panchayat, municipal, Assembly and Lok Sabha elections must be prepared repeatedly, largely by government school teachers. Their frequent deployment for training and election duties disrupts teaching, hurting students, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds. A paper presented to the Ram Nath Kovind Committee (an 8-member high-level panel on simultaneous elections) by [former Finance Commissioner] N.K. Singh and Prachi Mishra [economics professor] estimated a recurring loss of 1.6% of the GDP, roughly ₹7 lakh crore, due to frequent elections, a cost that could otherwise fund housing, infrastructure, and development. [Former IMF chief economist] Gita Gopinath has also acknowledged the economic impact. Elections cause investment delays, including FDI, as investors wait for political clarity at both the State and Central levels. Without at least four-and-a-half years of stable governance, meaningful outcomes cannot be delivered. If India aspires to become a developed nation by 2047, electoral reform is essential. To quantify the losses more accurately, the panel has asked Chief Secretaries of all States and Union Territories to study the impact of frequent elections.\nThere are two main criticisms of this legislation. Firstly, that it violates the basic structure of the Indian Constitution. Secondly, it is against the federal framework of the Constitution. After all, elections are the only way to hold the government accountable. What are your thoughts?\nI have a question for those critics. From 1951 to 1967, elections were held simultaneously for the Lok Sabha and all State Assemblies. Were those elections against the basic structure of the Constitution? Were they against federalism? Even the Congress has attempted to synchronise the elections by dissolving seven State Assemblies around 1968. Even today, several States still have elections held simultaneously. Is democracy, federalism and fundamental rights not fully protected in those States? This legislation is crucially about fixing the date of elections in such a way that they are held simultaneously. It does not seek to alter the federal framework or basic structure of the Constitution. There was only one caveat, which we also agree with, that the formulation of the Bill may require certain changes in drafting. Which is precisely why Parliament referred the Bill to the JPC to examine and make changes in its formulation.\nHow will the national election and State polls synchronise?\nThe Bill has two core objectives to synchronise all elections and to ensure that synchronisation is maintained thereafter. Under the proposed framework, if the Bill is enacted in 2028 and general elections are held in 2029, the date of the first sitting of the new Parliament, say May 30, 2029, becomes the permanent “appointed date”. By 2034, all State Assemblies would align their election cycles so that the polls conclude by this fixed date.\nTo achieve synchronisation, some Assemblies may need shorter initial terms. This is constitutionally defensible: if a no-confidence motion can legitimately bring down a government within a year, resulting in a curtailed term, Parliament can similarly legislate a one-time adjustment in public interest.\nMaintaining the synchronisation thereafter would require addressing scenarios where governments fall midterm. The panel is examining the ‘remainder term’ principle, already used in Panchayati Raj institutions, where no-confidence motions are restricted for a certain period and any subsequent fresh election is held only for the remaining term. Applying similar principles to State Assemblies and Parliament could deter political instability since representatives would risk returning to office for only two or three years.\nThe panel is also exploring options for rare cases of legislative deadlock such as enabling a national government or electing a Prime Minister or Chief Minister on the floor of the House for the remainder of the term. Another question under consideration is whether no-confidence motions should be barred during the final year of a five-year cycle since holding elections for a one-year term is impractical. We are actively considering introducing a provision that would bar the moving of a no-confidence motion if the incumbent government has only one year left in its term. These are ultimately political decisions, though legally workable.\nThe Bill is currently silent on these provisions, and the committee will consult political parties before recommending any changes.\nThis legislation provides excessive powers to the EC, a concern raised by many of your panel members.\nThis is an important point. Section 82 A(5) of the new Bill states that “if the Election Commission is of the opinion that the elections to any Legislative Assembly cannot be conducted along with the general election to the House of the People, it may make a recommendation to the President to declare by an order that the election to that Legislative Assembly may be conducted at a later date”. The word used is “opinion”, which some members feel may not necessarily be based on objective criteria unless safeguards are built in. Some experts have suggested that such an opinion must be guided by clear, objective standards and considerations rather than being entirely discretionary. And, there must be a reason to be recorded and open to judicial review. We have to think about it. Even some of the former Chief Justices have also expressed their apprehension. We may decide to recommend the deletion of this provision or amend it to introduce safeguards. But that is for the committee to take a call unanimously. Prima facie, I, too, am of the view that this apprehension is correct. There is, however, another counter-view expressed by some members that this power has to be vested in some body. After all, the EC is a constitutional body, there is no reason to mistrust it.\nG Sampath: When you are saying that the no-confidence motion will be disincentivised in this system, especially in State legislatures, especially when there are one or two years left for the next election cycle date. In that sense, aren’t you sort of bringing in the presidential system of government by the backdoor?\nLet us look at panchayats. For the last 25 to 30 years, we have seen this system functioning successfully. Its validity was challenged in the Supreme Court on the grounds that restricting no-confidence motions for a certain period was anti-democratic. The argument was that if a no-confidence motion is brought and two years remain in the term, then preventing fresh election for that period is anti-democratic. But the Supreme Court held that it is not anti-democratic to restrict no-confidence motions for a certain duration because otherwise elections would be held repeatedly for short remaining periods. So, we must strike a fine balance between democratic principles and public interest. The people elect a government for five years. Yes, no-confidence motions are part of democratic principles. But at the same time we must consider public interest and administrative stability. There has to be a balance between democratic mechanisms and governance needs. Under the current Bill’s scheme and object, there are some gaps. Under Sections 14 and 15 of the Representation of the People Act, the EC has the power to initiate elections up to six months before the expiry of a term. But the Bill is silent on what happens if a government falls – how soon elections must be held? That gap needs examination by the committee.\nWe may consider provisions. For example, if three years of a term are completed and then a no-confidence motion is brought, what should happen? If only one year remains, should elections be held for just one year? Also, no public representative would like to take the risk of going for elections for just one year. It could very well act as a deterrent. If representatives know that after bringing down a government they may face an election for a very short term, they may think twice. At the same time, if a government cannot function if Bills are not being passed and governance is paralysed, then Parliament must decide how to ensure majority support. There is discussion about whether a CM or PM could be elected on the floor of the House in such a situation. I am not saying this will happen, but these matters are under debate. Our job is to deliberate with all political parties and stakeholders and then make recommendations.\nVarghese K. George: At the end of the day, this legislation is furthering a political argument. Your party’s position on it has come a full circle over the last 50 years. During the JP movement (1974-1977), the view was that if the public was dissatisfied, even a majority government should be held accountable and be prepared to step down. Now you are advocating something else.\nThe executive is accountable to Parliament, and Parliament to the public. This accountability does not end with elections alone. If the public is against a certain government, on moral grounds that government can be forced out. In such cases the ‘remainder term’ theory will come into force. This, however, is an exceptional scenario. And exceptions can’t be the rule. We have to strike a fine balance between democratic principles and national interest.\nSandeep Phukan: You need two-thirds majority to amend the Constitution. Can the government with its present strength in Parliament manage to push through this Bill?\nIt is an issue of national interest. Political ideologies will have to be set aside for it. It is not a reform that the BJP alone is pushing for. I have many friends in the Congress and other regional parties who also believe that this Bill should be brought in at the earliest.\nVijaita Singh: Have you figured out the logistics to hold simultaneous polls, like the number of EVMs needed, or will it be held in phases? Will votes be cast on a single day to elect Chief Ministers of all States & UTs, and the Prime Minister?\n‘One nation, One election’ does not mean that elections will be held in one day. That is not possible. It will be held in phases. The only crucial detail concerning the legislation is that the polls should be held before the “appointed date”. It is for the Election Commission to look at the logistics such as the law and order situation, police personnel, EVM machines. These are not the problems for the panel to weigh in on. I don’t think procuring two EVMs, one for the national elections and one for the State elections should be a challenge. In 2014, when our government came to power, the Budget was ₹18 lakh crore and today the recently passed Budget was of ₹55 lakh crore. To buy ₹10,000 or ₹15,000 crore worth EVMs should not be an issue.\nelection\n/\nnational elections",

        "title": "Maharashtra’s Ladki Bahin Yojana: Waiting for ₹1,500",
        "content": "A narrow lane that leads to Radhika Kamble’s house in Sangam Nagar in Mumbai.\n| Photo Credit: Emmanual Yogini\nRadhika Kamble, 49, seethes with anger every time someone mentions the Ladki Bahin Yojana, Maharashtra’s welfare initiative targeted at women. She feels betrayed, because two years after the scheme’s announcement, she has not yet been able to become a beneficiary. For a widow taking care of the household, the process was too overwhelming and there was no help, she says.\nBut that was not what left her feeling vulnerable. Within months of her husband dying, she was asked to take a photograph bereft of the mangalsutra, a symbol of marriage.\n“They told me that the officials should be able to easily identify women who really need the money. Married women don’t need it as much. We need it the most. The government will understand after looking at our photos, we were told,” she says. She chokes on her emotions. Sitting in a small, unventilated room in Sangamnagar, Mumbai, she goes through the documents and her photo again and again. Frustrated, she says, “Maybe money is not written into my fate.”\nThe Maharashtra government launched the Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana on June 28, 2024, under the leadership of then Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, “to promote women’s economic independence, improve their health and nutrition, and strengthen their decisive role in the family,” as per the policy document.\nThe government said the scheme would provide ₹1,500 via a Direct Benefit Transfer to women in Maharashtra between ages 21 and 65 years, from low-income families. The family’s annual income was to be below ₹2.5 lakh.\nMukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana — translated as the Chief Minister’s ‘My Favourite Sister’ scheme — was modelled on a similar scheme in Madhya Pradesh, and was expected to cost the government ₹46,000 crore annually.\nThe government introduced terms and conditions for the scheme. Women who had a family member with government employment, or belonging to families that paid taxes, or belonged to families that owned a car did not qualify. There was a cap of two women per household who could get the cash benefit. Those who were getting similar amounts of money from other government schemes were also not eligible.\nIn July, the first month after the scheme was launched, the government received 1.5 crore applications from across Maharashtra, says Amol Shinde, who was the head of the CM Welfare Cell when the scheme was launched in the previous Eknath Shinde government. The first payments to the 1.5 crore women started in August 2024, two days ahead of Raksha Bandhan, and a few months ahead of the Assembly elections. Women thronged banks to get their Know-Your-Customer (KYC) established, so they could avail themselves of the money. In the second month, September, about 2.6 crore women were registered. The scrutiny of the applications than began taking place and only 2.4 crore received the benefit, says Shinde. The government subsequently introduced another condition requiring women to complete e-KYC verification, after which the number of beneficiaries began to decline. In December 2025, the number of beneficiaries was 1.57 crore.\nWomen tie rakhis to then Mahrashtra CM Eknath Shinde after the launch of the “Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin” scheme, at Vidhan Bhavan in Mumbai on June 29, 2024.\n| Photo Credit:\nANI\nMany women say the payments came for several months, and then simply stopped, despite all documentation being complete. Some beneficiaries are still struggling to link their Aadhaar numbers to their bank accounts through an online system that often requires external assistance to complete the necessary forms.\nThe Opposition in Maharashtra has trained its guns on the government for slashing the number of beneficiaries, and for the financial strain the scheme has put on the State exchequer. It has accused the government of diverting funds from other welfare schemes to continue giving benefits under Majhi Ladki Bahin.\nIn June 2025, Nationalist Congress Party (SP) MP Supriya Sule told reporters that the scheme was a ₹4,800 crore fraud, with 14,000 men benefiting from it. She called for a white paper and a Special Investigation Report (SIT) on the scheme, saying many deserving women had been left out.\nIn 2025, flawed e-KYC questions wrongly flagged 24 lakh beneficiaries as government employees, halting their instalments, according to the Women and Child Development Department. Technical issues and glitches with the portal have plagued the effective rollout of the scheme so far, with women complaining of OTP failures, Aadhaar-bank linkage errors, and data mismatches.\nIn July 2025, a verification drive led to the suspension of 26.34 lakh accounts due to irregularities, including multiple claims within the same family, men receiving funds, and beneficiaries availing themselves of dual scheme benefits. Re-verification was subsequently conducted by district collectors. In January 2026, the e-KYC deadline was extended as a ‘last chance’ to rectify errors/OTP issues, until March 31, 2026.\nIn Mumbai’s Sangamnagar, Radhika, a mother of two, both in their 20s, lost her husband. A clerk, he fell and broke his hip. “We did not have the money to get him operated on,” she says. He eventually died.\nThe period after his death is a fog for her. When the scheme was announced, a local politician brought tempos with local party workers, who went door-to-door distributing forms for the scheme. Many women said they queued up at these tempos to submit the forms along with their documents.\nRadhika was one of them. When she did not get any instalment as other women started getting theirs in their account, she went to her bank to inquire. They asked her to check online. The operator of the cybercafe around her house asked her to visit her bank, saying some KYC documentation was pending. She went repeatedly between the bank and the cybercafe. Each time she had to travel to the nationalised bank, she would have to skip work, the odd jobs she had picked up in the vicinity.\n“After several visits, my son asked me not to feel bitter and to give up on it. I still feel there has to be some resolution. But there is no helpline, nobody to guide me,” she says. Now, with a new window for e-KYC opening up, she has filled it online and hopes to be enrolled as a beneficiary.\nIt is similar for Shakuntala Devi, 55, whose bank account was not linked to her Aadhaar number. Devi stays with her husband, two daughters, and a grand-daughter. She lost her son last year. Her husband is a taxi driver.\n“Her account was shut down automatically,” says her 26-year-old daughter Nandini Gautam. “We don’t know if it was because it was inactive. We opened another account and linked it with her Aadhaar, but the record showed that the seeding was inactive. The bank told us to fill up a DBT form. We did it. And yet, she hasn’t got a single instalment as yet.”\nNandini was herself getting instalments till December 2025, when she was asked to do the KYC again. The server issues and website problems did not allow her to complete the KYC process in the stipulated time, she says, adding that she has now completed the process on the phone after the new window opened up.\nPragati Nakti, 22, mother to a baby, used to get her instalments regularly without any problems till June 2025. Then, they stopped. She doesn’t know why. Nothing has changed, she says, adding that the post office where her money used to get deposited, can’t find a reason either. She lives with her brother, parents, and uncle, and is the only woman of the house who has filled the form.\nApart from filling the form online on the portal, many women have also filled up offline forms via Anganwadi sevikas, ASHA workers, and gram sevaks. In fact, a few months ago, the ASHA workers and Anganwadi sevikas refused to shoulder the extra burden of work any more.\nWomen say the money helps them spend on medicine, on children’s food and education, and on the daily needs of the family. “We don’t have to ask our husbands for money any more. We get our own money. It feels good. But we do not know for how long we will get it. There is always a sense that this will stop any minute,” says Shabnam Abdul Gaffar Shah, a 35-year old mother of five, in Mumbai’s Indiranagar.\nThe scheme helped buffer the shock of floods in Maharashtra’s Marathwada in 2025. It has helped in the empowerment of women, giving a boost to the rural economy, says Shinde.\nHe says they garnered this intelligence from the women. “We had formed a helpline to seek responses of women who were the early beneficiaries. It was astounding, the impact the scheme had. Shops started flourishing again. Women were seen to be spending primarily on healthcare, on children’s education, clothing,” he says.\nShinde says that while Madhya Pradesh’s Ladli Behna Yojana was their role model, the government drew inspiration from the success of its own scheme, Shasan Aplya Daari, which translates to government at your doorstep. Under this scheme, the government approached people with its schemes to increase the number of beneficiaries.\n“We realised after the analysis of data that very few women were drawing benefits from government schemes. That is when we thought we needed to do something to increase the coverage of women,” he says. At the time, the Opposition had criticised the timing of the scheme, considering it came just before the Maharashtra elections.\nAs a pilot, the Mukhyamantri Mahila Sashaktikaran Abhiyaan or Chief Minister’s Women Empowerment Drive was launched in two districts of Maharashtra. It was withdrawn almost immediately due to technical issues, but was reintroduced after the government order was modified on October 6, 2023.\n“Inspired by its success, we launched the Nari Shaktidoot app. Within one day, 50,000 women registered on it. When we saw that women were aware and interested in schemes, we worked to roll out this scheme in barely three months. After the announcement, 2.47 crore women enrolled themselves. It was a record, and a very satisfying process,” he said.\nHe added that he had prepared a list of 10 names, and that the then Chief Minister Eknath Shinde had liked and chosen the current name ‘Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana’.\nGround Zero\n/\nwelfare\n/\nMaharashtra\n/\nIndia",

File\n| Photo Credit: PTI\nThe Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Friday (February 20, 2026) notified another empowered committee comprising Census, postal and Intelligence Bureau (IB) officials in West Bengal to fast-track hundreds of pending citizenship applications under the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) amid the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in the State.\nSeveral people belonging to the Matua community, comprising Hindu Namasudras with roots in Bangladesh, have applied for citizenship under the CAA as their names are not in the 2002 electoral list, the threshold for the ongoing SIR exercise.\nA government source said that although an empowered committee headed by the Director, Census Operations exists in all States to process CAA applications, another such committee headed by the Deputy Registrar General, Directorate of Census Operations, West Bengal has been notified only for Bengal in the wake of a deluge of citizenship requests.\n“This is an additional committee that will process and fast-track CAA applications in West Bengal,” said the source.\nThe committee will comprise an officer in the Subsidiary Intelligence Bureau not below the rank of Deputy Secretary, two Under Secretary rank officials to be nominated by the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) and the National Informatics Centre of West Bengal, and the Postmaster General of the State.\nRead | Trinamool hails Supreme Court order to engage judicial officers for SIR in Bengal\nA representative from the office of the Principal Secretary (Home) or Additional Chief Secretary (Home) of the government of West Bengal and a representative of the jurisdictional Divisional Railway Manager of Railways would be the special invitees, the notification said.\nOn March 11, 2024, days ahead of the announcement of the general election, the MHA notified the Citizenship Amendment Rules, 2024 enabling the implementation of the CAA, four years after the legislation was passed in 2019.\nThe Act facilitates citizenship to undocumented people belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Parsi, Christian and Jain communities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan who entered India on or before December 31, 2014 and fast-tracks the process by reducing the eligibility to five years of continuous stay instead of 12 years.\nThough the legislation was brought in for undocumented migrants, the Rules mentioned several documents to be provided by the applicants, including a document issued by a government authority in Pakistan, Afghanistan or Bangladesh.\nEarlier, several members of the Matua community were hesitant about applying under the CAA as they had come from Bangladesh without any documents, but after the SIR was announced in West Bengal, there has been a significant increase in such requests.\nThe Matuas began migrating from Bangladesh in 1947 and continued to arrive in India both before and after the war in 1971 that liberated what was then East Pakistan from West Pakistan. In West Bengal, the community has a considerable presence in border districts such as North 24 Parganas, Nadia, Howrah, Cooch Behar, and Malda, and is the State’s second largest Scheduled Caste community.\nAs the CAA was opposed by many States, including West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, and in order to bypass the role of the State government in implementing the law, the MHA notified committees headed by Census and postal department officials who are Central government functionaries, leaving no scope for the involvement of State government officials.\nCitizenship is a subject under the Union List of the Constitution and the State’s role could have come into play in providing logistics such as office space and police verification of the applicants.\nWest Bengal\n/\nIndia\n/\nSpecial Intensive Revision of electoral rolls",

Between May and December 2025, groundwater levels rose by 8.7 metres, compared with the Rayalaseema regional average of 3.6 metres.

File\n| Photo Credit: PTI\nIMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva on Friday (February 20, 2026) said artificial intelligence could lift global growth by 0.8% and help India achieve the Viksit Bharat goal, but poses significant risk of displacement of jobs and financial stability.\nWhile being optimistic about the technology, Ms. Georgieva cautioned against “sugarcoating” the impact of AI and called for striking a balance between building and managing AI as a ‘force for good, or a force for evil’.\n“AI can lift up global growth by almost a percentage point. We say 0.8%. It would mean that the world would grow faster than it did before the COVID pandemic. And that is fantastic for creating more opportunities, more jobs. This is the magnitude that we see for India, and it would mean that India’s Viksit Bharat is achievable,” Ms. Georgieva said at the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi.\nShe said AI creates potential for countries that go fast on digital infrastructure, skills, and adoption of AI, and countries must embrace the opportunities, while being mindful of the risks.\n“I am very optimistic about AI. I’m also not naive, it brings significant risks,” she said while listing out three major risks from AI.\nFirst, it brings the risk of making countries and the world less fair as some countries will have the technology and others would not, and the other is the risk of financial stability, wherein AI could get loose and create havoc on financial markets.\nAlso, it brings the risk of displacement of jobs with no good thinking about how to help people find their place in the new AI economy.\n“We calculated this risk as very high. We actually see the impact of AI on the labour market like a tsunami hitting it. Globally, 40% of jobs will be affected by AI, some enhanced, others eliminated. In emerging markets 40%, but in advance economies, 60%. And that is happening over a relatively short period of time,” Ms. Georgieva said.\nShe said the IMF will continue to work with countries to understand what is happening in AI and then how to project it for policies for the future. “We have to be agile in how we look at AI,” she said.\nAn IMF research on how AI is affecting the labour market showed that in United States, 1 in 10 jobs already requires additional skills and for those who have the skills, the job pays better.\n“Now, with money in their pocket, people then go and buy more local services. They go to restaurants, entertainment, then creates demand for low-skilled jobs. And to our surprise, the total impact on employment in the aggregate is positive. One job in with AI, 1.3 jobs on in total employment. What does that mean? It means that a smaller segment of people get higher opportunities,” she said, adding AI could eliminate some of the low paying entry-level jobs.\n“What concerns us the most is that jobs that disappear tend to be entry-level jobs. They are routine and they are easily automated. So if you are in this place of the labour market, that is easily automated, of course, that creates a risk for you,” she said.\nShe said to deal with AI advancement, there is a need to revamp education system for a new world. “People have to learn to learn, not to learn specific skills so much,” she said.\nAlso, there has to be support and social protection for the dramatic change in the labour market and to create an overall enabling environment for workers.\n“It is important for the world to be very attentive to what works, what doesn’t work, and not sugarcoat the picture because if we do, we would end up where we ended up with globalisation. People revolting against it, despite all the benefits it brings, because, yes, the world was all benefitted, but some communities were devastated. And the world did not pay attention to this communities in a timely manner,” the IMF chief said.\nThe IMF is seeing how our countries are positioned in AI adoption with some countries actually have more demand for AI skills than supply, while some countries have more supply of AI skills than demand, and some have neither.\nStating that the most important factor in AI would be its ethical foundation, Ms. Georgieva said, “when I look at progress so far, we have done much more on the technical side of AI, and much less on building that strong, ethical foundation, and putting guardrails that are not restricting innovation, but are protecting us.”\nArtificial Intelligence\n/\ntechnology (general)\n/\nscience (general)",

It was during Mr. Natesh’s tenure as MUDA Commissioner that the Chief Minister’s wife B. M. Parvathi was allotted 14 alternative sites in lieu of 3.16 acres of land.

But when he did not budge, they have now arrested him,” he alleged.\nEarlier this week, Mr. Krishna had posted an audio on Facebook, which he claimed to be of Mr. Natesh talking to an unidentified person, asking him to arrange a face-to-face meeting with Mr. Krishna.\nIn his complaint, Mr. Natesh claimed the audio was fake.

He had also written to the Income Tax and Directorate of Enforcement making the same charges and demanded that both bureaucrats be probed.\n“Mr. Krishna is cooperating with the investigation and is providing us details.

Venugopal, on Friday (February 20, 2026) criticised the government for what members described as “lackadaisical” implementation of the Skill Acquisition and Knowledge Awareness for Livelihood Promotion (SANKALP) scheme, a flagship programme of the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship.\nThe panel was examining a Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report that highlighted significant delays and shortfalls in both financial and physical progress under the scheme. According to the CAG, only 44% of the budgeted provision for SANKALP was disbursed between 2017‑18 and 2023‑24 (as of October 2023), reflecting persistent underutilisation of funds. The audit also flagged weak adherence to implementation guidelines and a sluggish pace of execution across components.\nApproved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs in October 2017 with a total outlay of ₹4,455 crore, SANKALP was designed to strengthen short‑term skill training through better institutional frameworks, enhanced industry linkages, and targeted inclusion of marginalised communities. The scheme was slated to be financed through a World Bank loan of ₹3,300 crore, State leverage of ₹660 crore, and industry leverage of ₹495 crore.\nLaunched in January 2018, SANKALP was originally scheduled for completion by March 2023 but was later extended to March 2024. Against the first tranche of the agreed World Bank loan of $250 million, the institution disbursed ₹1,606.15 crore (86%), but the Ministry utilised only ₹850.71 crore as of December 2023.\nThe CAG attributed part of the delay to “non‑preparedness” within the Ministry before the commencement of the loan period. PAC members echoed this assessment during Friday’s meeting, questioning the government over the absence of a central monitoring mechanism and gaps in due diligence.\nSeveral MPs also noted the failure to present a clear plan for integrating skilling into the school curriculum from primary to higher secondary levels despite this being a key expectation linked to improving long‑term employability outcomes.\nparliament",

Harish Rao and others visiting the Devannapet pump house of Devadula Lift Irrigation Scheme in Warangal district on Friday.\n| Photo Credit: By Arrangement\nDeputy Floor Leader of the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) in the Assembly and former minister T. Harish Rao on Friday accused the Congress government of deliberately stopping water lifting from the Devadula project and causing severe hardship to farmers in Warangal district, despite ample water flow in Godavari river.\nHe along with several other leaders of the party visited the third pump house of the Devadula Lift Irrigation Scheme at Devannapet in Warangal district, which was not in operation as the motors were switched-off.\nSpeaking on the occasion, he said the government was not switching on the motors, though there was sufficient flow in the river and the ayacut was in need of water. He stated that about 16,000 cusecs of water was flowing in Godavari near Sammakka Sagar as on Friday.\nRecalling that Minister for Irrigation N. Uttam Kumar Reddy had announced on March 18 last year that the motors would be switched on, but left the site without ensuring that the pumps actually started functioning.  Due to the non-operation of the pumps last year, crops on nearly 60,000 acres dried up, causing huge losses to farmers, he alleged.\nThis season, water lifting was not being done for the last 10 days, affecting the ayacut in Jangaon, Palakurthi and Station Ghanpur constituencies, while the Gandiramaram lift was not being operated due to lack of water. Demanding immediate operation of all Devadula motors at full capacity and urgent steps to supply water to at least 3.5 lakh acres to protect farmers this season, Mr. Harish Rao said officials were citing “repairs” and “software issues” as excuses.\nHe pointed out that the third phase of the Devadula project, including the 49.5 km tunnel from Ramappa to Unikicherla, described as one of the longest tunnels in the world, was completed under the BRS Government. The Devannapeta pump house, built at a depth of 155 metres, is among the deepest in the world, he noted.\nThe BRS leader stated that their government had expanded the ayacut from about 47,000 acres to over 3.17 lakh acres. Maintenance funds of about ₹8 crore were not released to contractors last year, he pointed out and said that it had resulted in pumps remaining idle and leading to crop loss estimated at ₹700–800 crore.\nThough the Bhimganpur pump house has the capacity to lift 2,160 cusecs, only about 1,700 cusecs was being lifted and only five or six motors were being operated instead of all 10. He also sought to know why lift irrigation points such as Gandiramaram were shut down when farmers urgently needed water.",

        "content": "The South India Textile Research Association (SITRA) in Coimbatore will set up a laboratory soon to test fabrics used to make garments for sports and athletics (sportswear and athleisure).\nThe Tamil Nadu government recently announced in its Interim Budget for 2026-27 that it will give ₹6 crore to SITRA to set up a laboratory.\nPrakash Vasudevan, director of SITRA, told The Hindu on Friday that a 2,000 sq.ft laboratory will be set up soon with imported machinery to test fabrics that are used to make sportswear and athleisure wear. The Association has developed the required infrastructure at about ₹30 lakh and is likely to spend another ₹30 lakh, apart from the funds from the Tamil Nadu government, to purchase the requirement equipment.\nLess than half a dozen companies in India make these garments and there is just one laboratory in Mumbai to test the fabrics. Most of the manufacturers currently import fabrics to make sportswear or athleisure wear. These fabrics need to be tested regularly for various parameters - stretchability, moisture absorption capacity, softness, and so on. These garments are highly engineered right from yarn to finishing and are in huge demand in India and abroad. When a company imports the fabric samples, these need to be tested to see if the fabric will meet the specifications of the garment. Setting up a laboratory for this purpose will encourage more companies to go in for apparel used for sports and athletics, which are highly value added. “The laboratory can be commissioned in three months from the time of receipt of funds,” he said.\nThe SITRA has also submitted a proposal to the National Technical Textile Mission to set up a facility here at ₹20 crore to develop the fibre to make yarn for these garments. If this project is sanctioned, it will be a major boost to production of sportswear in India, he added.",

        "content": "The High Court of Karnataka has declined to quash criminal proceedings against four persons, who were among the several accused persons involved in a cyber fraud case of allegedly cheating a businessman of ₹7.15 crore by promising him to get a ₹225 crore loan from State Bank of India (SBI), and opening a fake account in his name by using counterfeit website in the name of SBI Corporate Finance (sbicf.co.in).\nThe court has termed the criminal case as “akin to a crime thriller or a crime potboiler” on noticing how the accused persons had created a counterfeit website in the name of SBIFC, generated fake emails and One Time Passwords (OTP) to make the complainant believe that the offer of loan is from ‘SBI’s corporate finance branch.”\nJustice M. Nagaprasanna passed the order while dismissing the petition filed by K. Balajee, a resident of Dindigul in Tamil Nadu; S. Jeevan Sebaratnam, who is of Sri Lankan origin, having German citizenship, and having residences both in the United Kingdom and Bengaluru; Vinay Kumar Agarwal, a city-based businessman, and Simia Fathia, a resident of Chennai in Tamil Nadu.\nThe Bengaluru city police registered the case in 2022 on the complaint lodged by Vinayak Kabadi, a businessman from Betageri in Gadag district.\nThe court noted that the prime accused, Muzib Abdul Mian alias Niyaz, also from Tamil Nadu, was involved in cheating other businessmen in Hyderabad and Mumbai in a similar way by creating fake websites of banks, and criminal cases have been registered earlier against him in those cities.\nThe accused had made the complainant, who was looking for loan to set up a sugar factory, to believe that they would get the loan required for him from SBIFC, and demanded a commission of 7% on the sanctioned loan amount. They had arranged meetings at five start hotels in Bengaluru and Chennai during 2017 where some of the accused impersonated as officials of the bank.\nThe chargesheet alleges that the counterfeit website was created to mislead the complainant, and emails and OTP alerts were allegedly generated to show that ₹225.49 crore had been credited to his purported account created using the counterfeit website. Believing them, the complainant paid ₹7.15 crore as 50% of the agreed commission, through bank transfers and cash instalments in early 2018.\nHowever, when the complainant could not withdraw ₹225 crore from the account, the accused convinced him that it was due to a technical snag. The fraud came to light when the complainant’s repeated attempts to withdraw funds failed, he discovered that the website was inactive, and later some accused became incommunicado during 2020. The complaint was lodged in 2022, citing a delay due to assurances from the accused to return the commission amount and COVIND-19.\nRefusing to accept the claim of the accused that it was a civil dispute over payment between them and the complaint, the court said that “the allegations of creation of fake websites, impersonation of bank officials, fabrication of electronic communications cannot not treated as civil disputes”.",

        "title": "Junior UP Engineer, Wife Get Death Penalty For Sexually Exploiting Minors, Selling Videos Abroad",
        "content": "How did a junior engineer posted in Uttar Pradesh’s irrigation department turn into the kingpin of an international child sexual abuse racket? The answer emerged in a Banda courtroom on Friday, where a POCSO court, in one of the most disturbing child sexual abuse case, awarded the death penalty to Ram Bhavan and his wife Durgawati for sexually exploiting minors and selling their videos on the dark web to international buyers.\nThe convicts — Rambhavan, a junior engineer in the irrigation department posted in Chitrakoot, and his wife Durgavati — were ordered to be “hanged till death\" by Special POCSO Judge Pradeep Kumar Mishra.\nThe court observed that the crime fell within the “rarest of rare\" category due to its brutality, premeditation, and international ramifications.\nThe couple had been convicted on February 18 following a lengthy trial based on digital evidence, medical reports, and testimonies of multiple victims.\nHow The Case Began\nThe case dates back to October 2020, when the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) received inputs from INTERPOL regarding the circulation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) linked to an Indian phone number. Acting on this intelligence, the CBI registered an FIR on October 31, 2020.\nOn November 17, 2020, Rambhavan was arrested. His wife Durgavati was also taken into custody after investigators found evidence of her involvement. According to the prosecution, the couple targeted children from economically weaker backgrounds in Banda, Chitrakoot, and surrounding districts.\nThey allegedly lured minors aged between 5 and 16 years with inducements and gifts. The court was told that the children were sexually assaulted and the acts were recorded using a laptop camera and mobile devices. These videos and photographs were then uploaded and distributed through the dark web to international networks.\nDigital Trail And Evidence\nDuring the investigation, the CBI recovered a pen drive containing 34 videos and 679 photographs of minors. Digital forensic analysis linked the content directly to the accused. Investigators also found that the material had been shared with buyers in 47 countries, including China, the United States, Brazil, and Afghanistan.\nThe charge sheet, running into nearly 700 pages, was filed 88 days after the arrests. It included medical examination reports of the victims, statements from children and witnesses, and digital evidence establishing the online distribution network.\nIn total, 74 witnesses were examined during the trial. The CBI recorded statements from individuals aged between 4 and 42 years to build a comprehensive case.\nAdvocate Kamal Singh, associated with the POCSO court proceedings, said the case was initiated after international intelligence inputs flagged suspicious online activity.\n“The investigation revealed a systematic pattern of abuse and online dissemination. The digital evidence was crucial in securing the conviction,\" he said.\nRole Of Wife And Attempt To Influence Witnesses\nWhile Rambhavan was found directly involved in the sexual assaults and recording of videos, Durgavati was also held equally responsible. The court noted that she not only participated in the exploitation but also attempted to pressure witnesses and facilitate compromise efforts during the investigation.\nThe prosecution said that the involvement of both parents-like figures in such crimes deepened the psychological trauma of the victims and demonstrated a calculated and sustained pattern of abuse.\nCourt’s Observations\nPronouncing the sentence, Judge Pradeep Kumar Mishra said the offence was extremely heinous and had a far-reaching impact on society.\n“The acts committed by the accused are of such a grave nature that they strike at the very foundation of societal morality and the safety of children. This court finds it appropriate to award the maximum punishment,\" the judge observed.\nThe court further directed the District Magistrate to ensure that each identified victim receives Rs 10 lakh as compensation for rehabilitation and medical support. Some of the affected children reportedly underwent treatment at AIIMS, New Delhi, for physical and psychological trauma.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "In continuation of the probe into allegations of ghee adulteration in the making of the sacred Tirupati Laddoos, which the ruling Telugu Desam Party-led NDA government has levelled against the previous YSRCP regime, the Andhra Pradesh government has now set up a one-man committee to examine the findings of the Special Investigation Team (SIT).\nRetired IAS officer Dinesh Kumar has been appointed to study the SIT’s self-contained note and recommend action, if required, against Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) officials and committee members.\nAccording to the government order, Kumar has been tasked with examining the SIT note and recommending initiation of suitable action, if deemed necessary, against erring committee members and senior TTD officers.\nThe committee will specifically look into administrative lapses in the relaxation and enforcement of tender conditions. It will also examine whether decisions were taken with due diligence, proper recorded justification and procedural compliance.\nThe panel has also been asked to identify the extent of administrative responsibility, if any, of officers, committee members or TTD functionaries in relation to the lapses flagged in the SIT report, and recommend appropriate administrative or disciplinary action.\nThe government has made it clear that the committee’s examination will be confined strictly to administrative and governance aspects.\nThe move comes after the state Cabinet, in its last meeting, announced that a separate panel would be set up to examine the SIT report. The latest order formally gives effect to that decision.\nThe government order refers to the FIR/ Crime No. 470/2024 was registered at Tirupati East Police Station over the alleged supply of adulterated and sub-standard ghee to TTD.\nIt also references the Supreme Court, through its October 4, 2024 order in W.P.(C) No. 622/2024 where it entrusted the investigation to an independent SIT functioning under the supervision of the Director of the Central Bureau of Investigation.\nAfter completing the investigation, the SIT filed its charge sheet before the court on January 23, 2026. Along with this, it submitted a self-contained note recommending that suitable action be initiated against committee members and senior TTD officers for lapses, omissions and failures in both relaxing and enforcing ghee tender conditions.\nIt is based on these findings that the government has now constituted the one-man committee.\nThe committee has been given the power to call for records, seek written clarifications and obtain expert assistance, subject to prior government approval. It has been directed to submit its report within 45 days from the date of the order.\nThe Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams will provide the necessary secretariat assistance to the panel.\nThe government has also clarified that the report will be recommendatory in nature and will be examined before any further action is taken.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "Days after India joined 100 countries in signing a joint statement that criticised Israel’s “unilateral\" measures in the occupied West Bank, the Ministry of External Affairs said on Friday that it was not a negotiated document and India’s position was already expressed in the India-Arab League Ministerial Joint Statement.\n“You may be aware that this was not a negotiated document as is usually the case in the UN. Our position on this issue was most recently expressed in the India-Arab League Ministerial Joint statement,\" said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal during a press briefing.\nJaiswal was referring to the India-Arab Foreign Ministers’ meeting last month, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi reiterated India’s continued support for the people of Palestine and welcomed ongoing peace efforts, including the Gaza peace plan.\n“‘Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to achieving a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace in the Middle East, according to international law, relevant UN resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative. They called for a sovereign, independent and viable State of Palestine based on 1967 borders, living side by side in peace with Israel. Both parties supported the practice of inalienable rights of the Palestinian people,\" read a joint statement issued by India and Arab countries.\nThe MEA clarified that India has associated itself with the initiative, keeping in mind the concerns addressed by the statement.\nIsrael’s West Bank Plans\nAt least 100 countries, including Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, the League of Arab States, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the European Union, signed the statement condemning Israel’s plans for the annexation of the West Bank.\nThe joint statement said, “We strongly condemn unilateral Israeli decisions and measures aimed at expanding Israel’s unlawful presence in the West Bank. Such decisions are contrary to Israel’s obligations under international law and must be immediately reversed.\"\nIt underlined strong opposition to any form of annexation and rejected all measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem.\nThis came after Israel’s cabinet on Sunday approved further measures to tighten Israel’s control over the occupied West Bank and make it easier for settlers to buy land. Palestinians termed this move “de-facto annexation.\" The foreign ministry said the measure would promote transparency and help resolve land disputes.\nThe West Bank is among the territories that Palestinians seek for a future independent state. However, many on Israel’s religious right view it as Israeli land.\nThe Palestinian presidency condemned the step, saying it constitutes “a de-facto annexation of occupied Palestinian territory and a declaration of the commencement of annexation plans aimed at entrenching the occupation through illegal settlement activity.\"\n(with inputs from agencies)\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "‘Existed Earlier, Exists Now’: Karnataka Minister Admits 'Commission' Culture Amid Contractor Row",
        "content": "A political controversy has erupted in Karnataka after Public Works Minister Satish Jarkiholi acknowledged that the practice of “commissions\" or kickbacks continues within the state’s governance system.\nThe minister’s remarks come amid mounting tensions with the Karnataka State Contractors Association (KSCA) announcing a statewide protest on March 6, alleging that the government has failed to clear pending bills amounting to ₹37,370 crore.\nThe association has accused the Congress-led government of presiding over worsening corruption and administrative paralysis, intensifying the political heat around infrastructure projects.\nResponding to questions on allegations of commission-taking in the Public Works Department (PWD), Jarkiholi made an unusually candid statement.\n“That’s there. It was there before. It’s there now. It will be there in future. It’s difficult to trace where exactly it happens. Allegations keep coming from different sides. It existed earlier, it exists today, and it may exist tomorrow as well. But it has to be controlled. We must put an end to it,\" the minister said.\nThe comments have triggered sharp political reactions, particularly because the Congress swept to power in 2023 after targeting the previous BJP government over the alleged “40 per cent commission\" culture in public works.\nJarkiholi’s statement is being viewed by critics as an implicit admission that illegal payments and systemic corruption remain deeply entrenched within sections of the bureaucracy, despite the government’s promises of reform and transparency.\nThe controversy has gained further traction with contractors warning of a deepening financial crisis due to unpaid dues. The KSCA claims that prolonged delays in payments have pushed many contractors to the brink, stalling development works across the state.\nThe March 6 protest is expected to intensify pressure on the Congress administration to urgently clear bills and restore confidence within the infrastructure sector.\nThe issue is politically sensitive for Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, whose government had projected itself as a clean and accountable alternative to the previous regime.\nThe opposition Bharatiya Janata Party seized on the minister’s remarks to mount a fierce attack on the government. Leader of Opposition R Ashoka accused the Congress of hypocrisy, alleging that corruption remains central to its governance.\n“He has admitted this because he is also corrupt. Corruption has been there since independence and its foundation was laid by the Congress. This is a shame for the Congress government. The minister has openly accepted that the party is corrupt,\" Ashoka alleged.\nLatest Blogs",

These nicknames are not just labels- they are symbols of fear, reputation and identity. Some are born from physical traits, some from a single notorious act and others from quirks or accidents that became legendary.\nIn India, Khusnuma Ansari, now dubbed “Madam Zeher,\" allegedly ran a drug syndicate while keeping up the facade of a beauty parlour in Northeast Delhi. Abroad, criminals like Edgar Valdez Villarreal, known as “La Barbie,\" and Charles Sobhraj, the “Bikini Killer,\" have become infamous almost entirely because of the dramatic monikers that accompany them.\nFrom cunning killers to drug lords, from petty thugs to serial murderers, this list takes you through some of the strangest, most chilling aliases of gangsters and serial killers:\n1. Madam Zeher- India’s Poison Queen\nKhusnuma Ansari, allegedly running a drug syndicate linked to the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, earned the nickname “Madam Zeher\" (poison) from police for her alleged role in narcotics distribution. Her beauty parlour in Northeast Delhi was reportedly just a front.\n2. Salim Tukaram- Named After A Savior\nSalim, a hitman for Abu Salem, got his surname from a Shiv Sena leader who saved him after an accident. A name born of compassion for a man known for killings.\n3.

His aliases emphasise both cunning and menace.\n4. Edgar Valdez Villarreal- La Barbie\nThis Mexican drug lord was dubbed “La Barbie\" because of his blue eyes and blonde hair. Appearance couldn’t disguise the brutal violence he unleashed in the US-Mexico drug trade.\n5. Poone- The Cat-Eyed Don\nNarasimha Murthy from Bengaluru earned this Tamil nickname meaning “cat,\" referring to his piercing eyes that terrorized victims.\n6. Station Shekhar- The Railway Phantom\nA notorious travel mafia don, he hid in railway stations after committing crimes, earning a nickname directly tied to his escape strategy.\n7. Koti Rama- The Monkey Man\nAnother Bengaluru gangster, Koti Rama’s nickname derived from his simian-like appearance.\n8. Cyanide Mohan- The Methodical Killer\nMohan Kumar, convicted serial killer in India, used cyanide to murder his victims. His nickname is literal, terrifying and unforgettable.\n9. Ted “The Milwaukee Cannibal\" Bundy\nBundy, one of America’s most infamous serial killers, was called the Milwaukee Cannibal (among other nicknames) for his brutal killings and manipulative persona.\n10. Richard “The Night Stalker\" Ramirez\nRamirez, active in California, earned this name for his nighttime killing spree. His nickname conveyed both fear and the method of his crimes.\n11. Andrei “The Butcher of Rostov\" Chikatilo\nChikatilo, convicted of murdering over 50 people in the USSR, became notorious as “The Butcher of Rostov,\" a name that captured the gruesome nature of his crimes.\n12.

Tractor entry fees have also been revised upward, from Rs 70 to Rs 100.\nHowever, the rate for double-axle bus-trucks remains unchanged at Rs 570.\nLocal Himachal Pradesh-registered vehicles will continue to be exempt.\nThe entry fee revision is part of a broader effort by the Congress government led by Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu to strengthen state finances amid mounting fiscal pressure. Special committees headed by district collectors have been formed to implement the new rates and manage barrier operations at key entry points including Parwanoo and Baddi in Solan, Mahatpur in Una, Kandwal in Kangra, Garamaura in Bilaspur and Govindghat in Sirmaur.\nLatest Blogs",

What has been impressive is the attendance of Presidents, Prime Ministers, and world leaders, and they’ve come with a strong message of wanting to see a newly integrated world in AI development, where the impact upon society would be the Principle. Preoccupation in India has clearly led the drive in this area. As far as the French Rafale is concerned, parts of it are being manufactured in India, and that is a very important aspect of the deal because it is part of strengthening our defence, but also increasing our self-reliance in the defence sector… Defence is important for India not because we want to go to war, but because we don’t want others to think that we are so weak that they can be tempted to go to war. It is a defensive defence literally, and I support the government on that.”\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "An immigration officer has allegedly lost Rs 79 lakh after falling victim to a sophisticated cryptocurrency investment fraud, police said on Thursday.\nThe 41-year-old officer working at Malaysia’s consulate general office in Mumbai, approached the police authorities around one-and-a-half years after the incident, citing severe mental stress and fear of social stigma, officials from the East Region Cyber Police said.\nAn official said that in January 2024, the officer was added to a WhatsApp group called “EG Plan,\" where members frequently shared updates and tips related to share trading. Having a basic understanding of the stock market, he found the content credible. Following the group’s guidance, he signed up on a company website and started investing.\nOver time, he transferred funds through online transactions and RTGS to more than 18 different bank accounts. In the beginning, he received returns of Rs 1.69 lakh, which boosted his confidence in the scheme.\nEncouraged by the initial payout, he went on to invest around Rs 78.85 lakh between April 2024 and June 2025, believing he was putting the money into cryptocurrency trading, the official added.\nWhen he attempted to withdraw his investment and profits, the fraudsters allegedly demanded an additional Rs 18 lakh as “processing fee\". But after he refused to pay, all the communication was cut off.\nHe later informed his bank, which advised him to approach the police.\nFollowing his complaint, police registered a case against 10 unidentified persons under charges of criminal conspiracy and cheating, along with relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act.\nPolice are currently tracing the bank accounts where the funds were transferred and identifying the account holders, the official said, adding that investigation was underway.\n(With inputs from PTI)\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "RSS Affiliate Laghu Udyog Bharati Urges Govt To Drop Blue Line Plan For Antimicrobial Drugs",
        "content": "A month after the central government mandated marking antimicrobial drugs with a conspicuous blue vertical line, RSS-affiliated Laghu Udyog Bharati (LUB) has urged the health ministry not to proceed with the final notification, arguing that the move would impose heavy economic and environmental costs without meaningfully addressing antimicrobial misuse.\nIn a letter dated February 18, seen by News18, LUB has requested the government “to reconsider the proposed amendment under global prospective and consider our above factful submission and do not go for final notification\".\nLUB is an all-India organisation representing micro and small enterprises (MSMEs) and claims to represent over 64,000 members across the country.\nThe blue line proposal was introduced through draft notification in January, proposing an amendment to Rule 96 of the Drugs Rules, 1945, to mandate “a conspicuous blue vertical strip on the labels of antimicrobial drugs\".\nAntimicrobial drugs include antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals and antiparasitic medicines used to treat infections caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites. India has been grappling with rising antimicrobial resistance (AMR), largely driven by irrational use, self-medication and over-the-counter availability of antibiotics despite prescription requirements.\nThe proposed blue line is intended to function as a clear visual identifier, reinforcing that these medicines should be used strictly under medical supervision. It builds on earlier regulatory efforts such as the red line warning introduced in 1993 and the later red box warning under Schedule H1.\nHowever, LUB argues that past visual labelling interventions have not significantly altered misuse patterns. In its letter, the organisation states, “Experience from earlier labelling interventions shows that such changes do not materially impact misuse.\" It notes that despite decades of red line and red box warnings, “irrational use and over-the-counter sale of antibiotics continue\".\nIn its representation, seen by News18, LUB contends that the amendment would require manufacturers to redesign labels, revise approved artworks and discard existing packaging material. “The proposed requirement will necessitate redesigning of labels, revision of approved artworks, and disposal of existing printed packaging material, resulting in significant financial and operational burden, particularly for MSME manufacturers,\" the letter said. It warns that sudden implementation could lead to “losses running into crores of rupees for even a single manufacturing unit\".\nThe organisation also flags environmental implications, pointing out that pharmaceutical packaging relies on pre-printed aluminium foils and specialised printing cylinders. Large-scale destruction of these materials, it said, would generate industrial waste and increase pollution. The letter cautions that repeated labelling changes would lead to “high economic and environmental costs without delivering commensurate public health benefits\".\nLUB further argues that antimicrobial drugs are already governed under Schedule H and Schedule H1 with specific labelling and prescription requirements. According to the letter, “The addition of another visual identifier, such as a blue line, may create confusion among healthcare professionals and patients rather than improving rational use.\" It also raises concerns that mandatory domestic labelling changes could disrupt export packaging and regulatory harmonisation, potentially affecting manufacturing efficiency and India’s competitiveness.\nUltimately, the organisation maintains that the core issue lies in weak enforcement at the distribution and retail level. “Antimicrobial misuse is primarily driven by weak enforcement at the distribution and retail level, where antibiotics continue to be available over the counter despite existing legal restrictions,\" the letter stated, suggesting stronger enforcement and accountability measures rather than additional visual markers.\nConcluding the letter, LUB has urged the ministry to take a broader view before proceeding, stating: “In view of the above, we humbly request the ministry to reconsider the proposed amendment under global prospective and consider our above factful submission and do not go for final notification.\"\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "After the recent elections in Bangladesh, intelligence agencies in India have sounded an alarm over Rohingya refugees, illegal immigration, terror networks and demographic changes in West Bengal ahead of the upcoming Assembly polls, sources told CNN-News18.\nIn an election marred by violence targeting religious minorities and widespread irregularities, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), led by former PM Khaleda Zia’s son Tarique Rahman, secured a strong mandate, winning 209 of the 299 seats, while the Jamaat-e-Islami secured 68 seats, making it the chief opposition party. Ousted PM Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League was banned from contesting the polls.\nHowever, intelligence agencies have warned that Pakistan’s ISI is colluding with the Jamaat-e-Islami and using its seats in Bangladesh’s Satkhira and Chuadanga to push illegal immigrants into West Bengal’s Nadia and Murshidabad districts, according to sources.\nAdditionally, Jamaat’s radical spread is being used to activate terror sleeper cells in North 24 Parganas to influence voter turnout during the West Bengal Assembly elections, sources said. These sleeper cells are also aiming to disrupt the elections in Malda.\nAttempts At Demographic Change In Bengal\nAccording to sources, Malda’s Muslim population is estimated at 55-60%, which is mainly due to cross-border migration and Jamaat-e-Islami’s victory in Bangladesh’s Chapainawabganj, which lies close to Bengal’s Malda and Murshidabad districts.\nAdditionally, intelligence agencies warned of attempts at demographic change and settlements of sleeper cells affiliated with terror groups with the help of Rohingya networks.\nGroups such as ARSA (Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army), RSO (Rohingya Solidarity Organisation), and JMB (Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh) are likely to coordinate their activities in Cox’s Bazar following the Bangladesh elections. This is expected to affect West Bengal’s Uttar Dinajpur district, with madrasa-linked networks in Birbhum potentially serving as key hubs.\nPakistan-China-Bangladesh Links\nIntelligence reports also pointed to links involving Pakistan and China, allegedly aimed at targeting Siliguri through the Kurigram airbase. Jamaat’s ideological infiltration into West Bengal’s borders could have potential for communal riots in Jalpaiguri and may impact voter safety and Trinamool Congress’ (TMC) hold in 2026.\nSeveral steps have been taken recently to address the issue, including the return of a large number of undocumented Bangladeshis in North 24 Parganas during the Election Commission’s Special Intensive Revision (SIR) process. BSF reported that at least 150–200 people are returning daily after verification, biometric checks and screening of criminal records.\nMigrants working as ragpickers, labourers or domestic workers, who have been living in India for more than 10 years using forged Aadhaar cards, voter IDs, and ration cards, are also returning due to fear of arrest and imprisonment linked to the SIR exercise.\nLatest Blogs",

The court said it was “shocking to note the callous and casual manner in which records are maintained, and the income generated from the sale of sacred offerings is accounted for.\"\nThe judges observed that even a small shopkeeper would be expected to maintain better financial discipline. “Even a person running a modest petty shop would be expected to maintain far better accounting discipline to ensure that income and stock are properly reconciled,\" the court remarked.\nAccording to the proceedings, ghee packets were issued to counters after being recorded in notebooks informally referred to as “Kutti Books\". Separate notebooks were maintained for each counter and kept in the temple office. These books recorded the number of packets issued along with the signatures of the staff receiving them.\nInvestigating officers produced one such 200-page school notebook before the court, relating to the Maramathu-II counter. On examining it, the court noted that entries covering the period from 17 November 2025 to 30 December 2025 occupied only about 20 pages. The notebook also contained several corrections, overwriting and interlineations, which drew the court’s disapproval.\nThe court further observed that the Temple Board and its officials were expected to exercise much greater supervision, especially since the sale of offerings generates several lakhs of rupees daily.\nLatest Blogs",

Eventually, they raised clenched fists instead of holding each other’s hands like others.\nSam Altman and Dario Amodei being forced to hold hands like two toddlers who just bit each other at daycare is the absolute peak of this summit. The sheer physical repulsion radiating off them is enough to power AGI. 🤣🤣🤣 pic.twitter.com/6gnfaZCCUv— Quant@Python (@BeingHorizontal) February 19, 2026\nMeanwhile, Altman clarified about the momentary hesitation he shared with Amodei at the international stage, saying that he was confused about what he was supposed to be do on the stage.\nSpeaking to Moneycontrol, Altman said that he was “sort of confused\" when Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was at the centre of the stage, grabbed his hand and thrust it upwards. “I just wasn’t sure what we were supposed to be doing,\" he told the news outlet.\nThe awkward moment highlighted the growing rivalry between OpenAI, led by Sam Altman, and Anthropic, headed by Dario Amodei.\nAnthropic was founded in 2021 by former OpenAI executives, including Amodei, who previously served as OpenAI’s Vice President of Research. In 2020, Amodei, his sister Daniela Amodei, and other senior researchers departed from OpenAI due to disagreements with Altman and the board regarding the company’s direction.\nThe split reflected differing philosophies around AI safety, governance, and commercial strategy. Anthropic positions itself as a safety-focused AI lab, emphasising alignment and responsible development through its Claude model family.\nOpenAI, meanwhile, has pursued rapid product deployment alongside safety research, bringing ChatGPT and enterprise AI tools to market at scale. The companies now compete directly in foundation models, enterprise partnerships, and government engagement, with both seeking leadership in the race toward artificial general intelligence (AGI).\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "In a move aimed at addressing the growing marriage challenges faced by young farmers, Congress MLA HD Ranganath wrote o Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah seeking the introduction of a special incentive programme.\nIn a letter dated February 18, the Kunigal MLA urged the government to take up the matter in the forthcoming Assembly session. According to PTI, Ranganath said his constituency, Kunigal Taluk, is “mostly rural and depends heavily on farming\". He noted that many young men continue to live in villages and earn their livelihood through agriculture, but “many women are not willing to marry them\".\nThe MLA pointed out that several men remain unmarried even after turning 30 and are facing difficulties because of this social trend. Highlighting what he described as an urgent concern in rural areas, he wrote, “So, I request that in the next session, a special allowance and special status be given to women who marry men living in villages and working in agriculture.\"\nRanganath believes such a measure would help resolve the problems faced by young farmers in rural areas and encourage greater support for farming livelihoods. He has called for a structured discussion in the Assembly and the formulation of a policy at the earliest.\nThe proposal has triggered debate across Karnataka’s rural belt. While many see it as a positive intervention to strengthen agriculture socially and encourage young farmers, others are examining it from the perspective of social balance and economic feasibility.\nThere has been no official response yet from the Chief Minister’s office.\nThe challenge of delayed marriages among young men in agrarian communities has persisted for years in parts of the state. Whether financial incentives can reshape social attitudes remains to be seen, but the debate has once again brought the realities of rural life and agriculture into sharp focus.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "Thursday marked the fourth—and most high-profile—day of the AI Impact Summit 2026 being held at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi as global leaders such as United Nations chief Antonio Guterres and French President Emmanuel Macron graced the occasion, discussing the breakneck rise of a technology that’s igniting both investor excitement and serious unease in equal measure.\nThe stellar line-up included Prime Minister Narendra Modi; Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani; Sunil Bharti Mittal, Founder and Chairman, Bharti Enterprises; Shantanu Narayen, Chairman and CEO, Adobe; Dario Amodei, CEO, Anthropic; Rishad Premji, Executive Chairman, Wipro; and Sam Altman, CEO, OpenAI.\nAs PM Modi positioned India as a future global AI hub built on inclusion, ethics and “AI for all,\" urging that the technology empower humanity rather than concentrate power, Pichai described India as being on an “extraordinary trajectory\" in AI adoption and talent and Ambani underscored massive private-sector investment bets on India’s AI future.\nHere’s a look at who said what at the summit:\nPM Narendra Modi: Unveiling his human-centric ‘MANAV’ vision for Artificial Intelligence at the AI Impact Summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi mentioned that the future of AI must be moral, sovereign and valid.\nIndia’s vision for AI is encapsulated in the word MANAV, which means human. pic.twitter.com/4IqFOg7YPx— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) February 19, 2026\nDecoding MANAV, the prime minister said the Hindi word for “human\" is also an acronym that captures India’s five core principles for AI: Moral and ethical systems, Accountable governance, National sovereignty (especially data rights), Accessible and inclusive technology, and Valid, legitimate AI systems that people can trust.\nEmphasising the need to place people at the heart of technological transformation, Modi called for making “skilling, reskilling, and lifelong learning a mass movement\" to prepare societies for the rapidly evolving digital era.\n“Artificial intelligence marks a transformative chapter in human history. India is not just a part of the AI revolution, but is leading and shaping it,\" he said in the presence of world leaders and CEOs of leading companies.\nThe prime minister also described AI as a historic transformation comparable to the invention of wireless communication. “When signals were first transmitted wirelessly, no one imagined that the entire world would one day be connected in real time. Artificial Intelligence is such a transformation of human history. What we are seeing today, what we are predicting, is just the beginning of its impact.\"\nIndia sees the future in AI, said the prime minister, as he said he believes that any model that succeeds in India’s scale and diversity can be deployed anywhere in the world.\nMukesh Ambani: The Chairman and Managing Director of Reliance Industries Limited likened Artificial Intelligence to Akshay Patra from the Mahabharat, saying it was not just another technology.\nSTORY | Jio with Reliance to invest Rs 10 lakh crore over 7 years: Mukesh AmbaniBillionaire Mukesh Ambani on Thursday announced Rs 10 lakh crore investment by his group as he promised to revolutionise artificial intelligence, as he did with mobile data.\nREAD:… pic.twitter.com/mO0xSCLomh\n— Press Trust of India (@PTI_News) February 19, 2026\n“Artificial Intelligence is not just another technology. For the first time, humans are creating human-like systems that can learn, speak, analyse, move, and produce autonomously. AI is the mantra that powers every yantra or every machine and system to work faster, better, and smarter. I see AI as a modern-day Akshay Patra, the legendary vessel in the Mahabharat that provided endless nourishment to all. Likewise, AI offers limitless augmentation in knowledge, efficiency, and productivity.\"\nAmbani said Reliance Jio will invest Rs 10 lakh crore over the next seven years towards AI, adding that Jio will also make AI widely affordable like it had done for internet data. “Jio has already started building AI applications for India’s most pressing challenges in inclusive development,\" he said.\nAsked about AI snatching jobs, Ambani sounded positive, saying the new technology will not eliminate jobs but create high-skill employment opportunities. “My confidence is validated by an undeniable truth. In the coming decades, no country in the world can match India’s strength in demography, democracy, development, digital infrastructure, data generation, AI harvest. India is the world’s largest mobile data consumer. Nearly 1 billion internet users, data costs among the lowest globally. And in terms of quality, there is no difference between Delhi and the remotest Indian village,\" he said.\n“Second, Aadhaar, 1.4 billion digital IDs.

Fifth, India’s secure and inclusive digital public infrastructure stack is now being adopted by countries around the globe,\" he added, noting that social relevance, not momentary craze, should drive AI growth in India.\nAntonio Guterres: The UN Secretary General, while praising the summit, cautioned that the future of Artificial Intelligence cannot be decided by a handful of countries or a few billionaires. “Done right, AI can advance sustainable development goals, accelerate breakthroughs in medicine, expand learning opportunities, strengthen food security, bolster climate action and disaster preparedness and improve access to vital public services,\" he said, adding: “But it can also deepen inequality, amplify bias and fuel harm. As AI’s energy and water demand soar, data centres and supply chains must switch to clean power.\"\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres congratulated Prime Minister Narendra Modi for India’s leadership in hosting the first AI Summit in the Global South.He said AI must benefit everyone and can advance the Sustainable Development Goals, accelerate medical discoveries,… pic.twitter.com/Pa1cKYLhac\n— PB-SHABD (@PBSHABD) February 19, 2026\nGuterres went on to say: “The meeting in India has special meaning.

India proved them wrong. And today, some say AI is a game only the biggest can play…\"\nThe French President added: “India and France, with Europe and our partners, those who believe in our approach… might have a different way… the future of AI will be built by those who combine innovation and responsibility, technology with humanity, and India and France will help shape this future.\"\nDario Amodei: The chief executive of the US artificial intelligence company Anthropic termed the “energy and ambition in this room and across India incredible\" and said: “I’ve been spending the last few days meeting with Indian builders and enterprises, and the energy to build together here is palpable, unlike anywhere else\".\nAt the India AI-Impact Summit 2026 in Bharat Mandapam, New Delhi, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei highlighted that the energy to build in India is unmatched.He emphasized India’s “absolutely central role\" in shaping AI opportunities and risks, noting that as the world’s largest… pic.twitter.com/XA3qOMYRPQ\n— PB-SHABD (@PBSHABD) February 19, 2026\nPointing to the company’s growing focus on India, he revealed that Anthropic has launched a new office in Bengaluru and named veteran business leader Irena Ghose, who brings three decades of experience building companies in India, as managing director of Anthropic India. He added that the company has secured fresh partnerships with leading Indian firms, including Infosys.\nAmodei argued that society is already far down the path where just a few years are left before AI systems outperform the vast majority of people in most areas of thinking and expertise.\n“There are only a small number of years for AI models to surpass the cognitive capabilities of most humans for most things. We’re increasingly close to what I’ve called a country of geniuses in a data centre, a set of AI agents that are more capable than most humans at most things and can coordinate at superhuman speed,\" he said.\nSam Altman: The OpenAI CEO praised India’s rapid adoption of Artificial Intelligence, saying: “It is amazing to be here, obviously the work happening in India and the adoption of AI is leading the world, and I can’t wait to see what goes next. This will be one of the biggest markets for AI in the world, and I think India will have a huge amount of influence.\"\nMr. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, delivered a keynote address highlighting the remarkable progress India has made in making AI accessible to millions.

Linking AI’s evolution to India’s democratic context, Altman said, “The world’s largest democracy is well positioned to lead AI—not just to build it, but to shape it and decide what our future is going to look like.\"\nHe noted that many current roles, particularly those driven by cognitive repetition, data processing, and even parts of software development will be reshaped as AI systems become more capable. “More than 100 million people in India use ChatGPT every week, and more than a third of them are students.\" India, he added, is also the fastest-growing market globally for OpenAI.\nSundar Pichai: Praising India’s transformation, the Alphabet CEO said he is always struck by the pace of change in the country. Pichai, contrasting the change that Andhra Pradesh has undergone, said he once travelled by train through Visakhapatnam. “Today, Google is building a full-stack AI hub in the same city as part of its $15 billion infrastructure investment in India,\" he said. Pichai added it was this technology that “can improve lives at once on a generation scale and can improve billions of lives with AI\".\nAddressing the India AI Action Summit today was a profound personal honor.AI can improve billions of lives and solve some of the hardest problems in science.\nThe best outcomes of AI are not guaranteed. We must pursue AI boldly, approach it responsibly, and work together…\n— Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) February 19, 2026\nThe Alphabet top boss, however, issued a warning regarding equitable access to technology, warning that the current digital divide must not become an “AI divide\".\nAnnouncing the “America-India Connect\" initiative, Pichai described it as a comprehensive digital infrastructure and AI investment plan that could potentially reshape the future of global tech collaborations and propel India’s position in the global digital economy. The new initiative is an extension of Google’s earlier announced $15 billion five-year AI investment in India, which was focused on a mega AI hub in Visakhapatnam.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "When people talk about higher education in Delhi-NCR, Galgotias University is often part of the conversation. The university is known for its courses, campus life and large student base.\nRight now, it is also in the news due to a controversy over a robot dog on campus. At the same time, many are looking at the journey of its founder, Suneel Galgotia, and how his family business grew over the decades.\nHow Suneel Galgotia Built The Institution\nGalgotias University was set up in 2011 near the Yamuna Expressway in Greater Noida. It offers many undergraduate, postgraduate and PhD courses. Today, the university is led by Dhruv Galgotia, the son of Suneel Galgotia, who serves as CEO.\nThe roots of this large education group go back many years. The Galgotia family once owned a bookstore called ‘E.D. Galgotia & Sons’ in Connaught Place, Delhi. The shop was started in 1933 at B-17, Inner Circle, during the British Raj. It became a well-known place for books and stayed open for over 80 years.\nSuneel Galgotia grew up around this bookstore. Later, when he took charge of the family business, he decided to expand. In the 1980s, he started Galgotia Publications. Over time, he moved further into the education sector.\nIn 2000, he began Galgotias Institute of Management and Technology (GIMT) with just 40 students. After that, he launched Galgotias College of Engineering and Technology. In 2011, he established Galgotias University in Greater Noida.\nFrom Small Bookshop To Rs 3000 Crore Group\nWhat began as a single bookstore slowly turned into a large education group. Today, reportedly more than 40,000 students study under the Galgotias banner. Students from over 40 countries come here for higher education, and alumni are spread across 96 nations.\nAs per reports, the family’s education business is estimated to be worth around Rs 3000 crore. Over the years, the group expanded step by step, adding new institutes and courses.\nThe original Galgotia Book Shop at B-17 is now marked as closed. Reports suggest it shut down around 2015 due to online competition and changes in the area. Another listing of E.D. Galgotia and Sons at No. 21 in Connaught Place reportedly remained on some directories with working hours (9:30 AM–6:30 PM, closed Sundays), but there is no clear update about its current operations.\nMeanwhile, the Galgotias group now runs bookstores within its university campuses in Noida.\nLatest Blogs",

Further coming down heavily on the Tamil Nadu government in view of the distribution of ‘freebies’ before elections, the apex court questioned, “What kind of culture are you trying to cultivate?\"\nThe top court’s comments came in regard to the Tamil Nadu Power Distribution Corporation Ltd’s plea, which proposed to provide free electricity to all, irrespective of the financial status of consumers.\nA bench comprising Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi emphasised that while it is the state’s responsibility is to empower its people, giving out freebies from morning to night is not the way to build the nation. Most states are already running a revenue deficit, and such policies only exacerbate the situation, leaving no funds for development.\n“Most of the states in the country are revenue-deficient states, and yet they are offering such freebies, overlooking development,\" the Bench said.\nThe bench said economic development of the nation gets hampered with this kind of largesse distribution and states should work to open avenues for employment instead of giving free food, cycles, electricity to all.\nFollowing this, the Supreme Court issued a notice to the Centre and others on the plea of the DMK government-led power distribution firm, which proposes to provide free electricity. The power firm has challenged a rule of the Electricity Amendment Rules, 2024.\n“What kind of culture are we developing in India? It is understandable that as part of the welfare measure, you want to provide to those who are incapable of paying the electricity charges. But without drawing a distinction between those who can afford and those who cannot, you start distributing.

        "title": "Bihar Unveils ‘Game-Changing’ E-Voting At AI Summit 2026 — But Is India’s First-Of-Its-Kind System Fraud-Proof?",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has entered into public systems such as elections. At the India-AI Impact Summit 2026, one of the most talked-about presentations came from Bihar’s State Election Commission which showcased a mobile-based AI-driven remote voting system.\nAccording to a report in NDTV, the commission is preparing to scale this model further and may expand it for use in the next Assembly elections.\nLet’s take a look at this tech innovation in detail.\nWhat Is Bihar’s AI-Based Remote Voting Model?\nBihar has introduced what it calls India’s first mobile-enabled remote voting platform. The system was first used during the 2025 urban local body elections and later presented at the summit as a model of digital governance.\nThe voting facility works through dedicated Android application, namely “e-Voting SECBHR\" which is developed by the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) in collaboration with the State Election Commission.\nThe system is designed mainly for people who face difficulty reaching polling booths. This includes migrant workers living outside their home districts, students, senior citizens, pregnant women, persons with disabilities and those who are unwell.\nHow Does The System Work?\nTo vote remotely, users must download the official app on an Android phone. Accessing the app requires verification via OTP which will be sent on the mobile number provided.\nIt is followed by live selfie verification. The system uses AI-based facial recognition to match the selfie with the voter’s EPIC (Electors Photo Identity Card) ID photograph. Once identity checks are cleared, the voter can cast their vote through the app.\nThe system was first used live on June 28 last year during municipal by-elections.\nWhat Security Measures Does The System Use?\nAs per the reports, platform has several layers of protection. These include AI facial recognition combined with liveness detection to ensure that a real person is present during verification.\nBefore the vote is recorded, OTP authentication and dual encryption are needed to be done. After the votes are casted, they are encrypted and stored using blockchain technology which is a tamper-resistant record.\nThe are audit trails similar to Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) as well. After polling ends, decryption is allowed only through secure digital signatures and multi-factor authentication by election authorities.\nWhat Features Ensure That There Is No Tampering?\nBlockchain plays a central role in protecting votes. Each vote is encrypted, anonymised and added as a new block in a decentralised ledger.\nTo alter a vote, someone would need to rewrite the entire blockchain across multiple distributed nodes which officials say is practically impossible due to computational limits.\nDecryption keys are only known to election authorities. And they are used only after polling concludes.\nHow Is Voter Privacy Ensured?\nOfficials say the system has been designed to protect voter secrecy at every stage. Before a vote is recorded, it is encrypted and de-identified so that the identity of the voter is not linked to the choice made. The verification of identity happens at the beginning of the process through EPIC-linked facial recognition, liveness detection and OTP authentication. Once verification is complete, the vote is anonymised and stored on a blockchain-backed ledger using secure hashing and smart contracts.\nFor counting, decryption is tightly controlled. It requires the use of Returning Officers’ Digital Signature Certificates (DSCs), along with two-factor authentication and post-poll hash verification. Authorities say this ensures that results can be audited without revealing how any individual voted.\nWhat Are The Potential Vulnerabilities?\nDespite strong safety measures, some risks also loom. It allows up to two voters to register on a single device.\nThere are also fears about impersonation and misuse especially in households where one individual may influence another’s vote. Initial verification partly relies on voter ID entry and there have been reports of facial recognition failures in some attempts.\nThe system is currently available only on Android devices which excludes iOS users.\nWhat Are The Privacy Concerns Related To The System?\nThis application collects personal data such as voter ID details, phone numbers, biometric information and device metadata.\nNaturally, this raises a question: How long this data will be stored? And whether there are clear policies on third-party access?\nHow Has The System Been Evaluated So Far?\nDuring the pilot phase, out of 14,804 attempts, 3,830 mock registrations were successfully completed.\nBihar officials maintain that EPIC-linked checks, encryption layers and post-poll decryption controls ensure that only genuine voters participate and that ballots remain secret.\nBut cybersecurity experts and organisations such as the Internet Freedom Foundation have urged caution. They recommend stronger oversight and regulatory clarity before expanding the system to full-scale Assembly elections.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "Speaking at the AI Impact Summit, US House Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence Policy Advisor Srinivas Krishna on Saturday said India can leverage American innovation to build artificial intelligence tools that directly benefit its citizens.\nSpeaking at a special session on the sidelines of the AI-India Impact Summit in New Delhi, Krishna described India as a “vibrant\" democracy and highlighted the shared strengths of the two countries in technology and research.\n“All the leading model companies are based in the US. It’s like you’ve built billions of dollars between this year and next year, that just keeps vertical on the GPUs, on advanced AI chips, Nvidia and TPUs are really the only game in town for everyone,\" Krishna said.

And, for example, the way we are trying to do it, I just give you one example in education,\" he said.\nKrishna noted that AI applications can extend beyond sectors like healthcare and be embedded in broader civic systems. “When people talk about what a country like India should do, I think about how do you use AI leverage, all of this investment leverage, all of the innovation happening in America, which we think is the best in class, and then build, you know, the services, the tools, which you utilize for your citizens,\" he added.\nReferring to India’s AI Action Plan, Krishna outlined three focus areas: accelerating innovation, building AI infrastructure, and leading internationally in AI governance and policy.\nHe also emphasised the need for open scientific collaboration between the two countries. “We want to make sure we unlock the Cernis of the world, the open ways of the world, the blocks of the world, the anthropics of the world,\" he said, underlining the importance of shared research and discovery.\nKrishna pointed to the TRUST (Transforming the Relationship Utilizing Strategic Technologies) initiative as a framework to deepen US-India collaboration in areas such as artificial intelligence, semiconductors, quantum computing, biotechnology and space.\nAs part of future cooperation, he said both countries are working on a roadmap under the US-India initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET), focusing on joint development in AI, semiconductor supply chains, defence technologies and advanced materials.\n“So a lot of scientific discovery is going to change, and we are only getting started. So I think it’s time of great excitement, and I think all of us should feel lucky that we’re living through this,\" Krishna said.\nLatest Blogs",

Without warning, they opened indiscriminate fire on him from close range, killing him on the spot and critically injuring his cousin, who was rushed to a nearby hospital.\nSenior officers reached the scene soon after the incident, cordoned off the area and launched a manhunt for the attackers. Forensic teams are scanning CCTV footage from the venue and surrounding areas as part of the investigation. Police have stated that the motive remains unclear, although preliminary investigations are underway.\nThe brazen shooting comes amid heightened tensions in the state. It follows several high-profile attacks on politicians in recent weeks, prompting criticism from opposition leaders who have blamed the ruling AAP government for a deteriorating security climate.\nBJP leader Jaiveer Shergill condemned the incident on social media, saying, “Another day, another broad daylight murder in Punjab.

        "title": "Ram Temple Fuels Ayodhya’s Economic Surge: Study Projects Rs 4 Lakh Crore Tourism Revenue",
        "content": "The construction and consecration of the Ram Janmabhoomi Temple in January 2024 has significantly reshaped Ayodhya’s economic landscape, leading a surge in tourism, investment and job creation, according to a new study by Indian Institute of Management Lucknow (IIM Lucknow).\nThe report, titled “Economic Renaissance of Ayodhya,\" examined the transformation of the temple town following the consecration of the grand temple. The report also described how faith-led infrastructure has become a durable growth driver, helping Ayodhya pivot from a low-capacity pilgrimage town to a high-footfall tourism hub.\nThe study has been authored by Venkataramanaiah Saddikuti of IIM Lucknow, KV Raju, Professor Emeritus at Chanakya University and economic advisor to the Uttar Pradesh government, and Gopika Varma of Indian Institute of Management Rohtak.\nAccording to the study, more than 11 crore (110 million) devotees visited Ayodhya within the first six months after the consecration. Annual footfall is now projected at 5–6 crore, placing the city among India’s leading religious tourism destinations.\nBefore the temple’s construction, Ayodhya’s economy revolved around small-scale pilgrimage activity. Annual visitor numbers were modest, hospitality capacity was limited, national hotel chains had negligible presence, and the absence of an airport constrained connectivity. Employment opportunities were limited, leading to youth migration.\nPost-consecration, redevelopment and capacity expansion projects worth approximately Rs 85,000 crore are underway, spanning roads, railways, urban renewal and airport expansion. These investments have helped crowd in private capital and expand the services sector.\nTourism-led economic activity is projected to generate Rs 20,000–25,000 crore in tax revenues over the medium term. The study estimated that tourism spending in Uttar Pradesh could cross Rs 4 lakh crore, with Ayodhya contributing a significant share.\n“The scale of the economic turnaround surprised us. When we began the study, we did not anticipate such a sharp enrichment of the region. The temple has acted as a catalyst, and infrastructure has converted footfall into sustained economic activity,\" professor Saddikuti told Moneycontrol. “This is not a one-off spike. We are seeing repeat visitation, longer stays and higher spend per visitor, which is what makes the model durable,\" he added.\nIt is noteworthy that after assuming office in 2017, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath accelerated the temple economy framework, coupling temple development with modern infrastructure expansion in Ayodhya, thereby opening pathways for broader economic prosperity.\nThe report further highlighted rapid employment growth across hospitality, construction, transport and services. Around 6,000 micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) have been newly set up or revived in and around Ayodhya. Over the next four to five years, tourism expansion is expected to generate approximately 1.2 lakh direct and indirect jobs.\nSmall retailers and street vendors report daily earnings rising from Rs 400–500 earlier to as much as Rs 2,500. Real estate prices near the temple precinct have risen five to ten times, attracting investors from across India.\nBetween February 2020 and February 2025, the Ram Temple Trust remitted around Rs 400 crore in taxes, including approximately Rs 270 crore in GST, indicating growing formalisation and compliance, the authors noted.\nDaily footfall of over two lakh pilgrims has sustained demand for hospitality and allied services. More than 150 new hotels and homestays have opened in the city. Major hotel chains, including Taj Hotels, Marriott International and Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, have announced expansion plans in Ayodhya.\nOnline travel platforms have reported up to fourfold growth in bookings. Tour operators said that pilgrims are increasingly combining visits to Ayodhya with trips to Varanasi, indicating the emergence of a broader spiritual tourism circuit.\nProfessor Saddikuti said that the Ram temple is shaping India’s emerging “temple economy\" playbook, comparable to redevelopment-led tourism growth seen around Kashi Vishwanath Temple and Mahakaleshwar Temple.\n“If connectivity, crowd management and last-mile services keep pace, Ayodhya can anchor a multi-city spiritual tourism circuit with measurable economic spillovers,\" he said.\nUnder the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the leadership of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, the temple-led development framework has gained academic validation, the report noted.\nLatest Blogs",

        "content": "The National Green Tribunal (NGT) recently cleared the Rs 80,000-crore Great Nicobar Island mega infrastructure project, stating there were “adequate safeguards\" in place.\nThe tribunal’s special six-member bench, headed by Chairperson Justice Prakash Shrivastava, refused to interfere with the environmental clearance (EC) originally granted in November 2022, citing the project’s strategic national importance.\nThe NGT’s decision followed a report from a High-Powered Committee (HPC), which was formed in 2023 to address earlier deficiencies in the clearance process.\nThe project, spearheaded by the Andaman and Nicobar Islands Integrated Development Corporation (ANIIDCO), includes an International Container Transshipment Terminal (ICTT), a greenfield international airport, a power plant, and a township.\nThe Great Nicobar Island (GNI) project, officially known as the ‘Holistic Development of Great Nicobar Island’, aims to transform India’s southernmost island into a major global maritime and strategic hub.\nThe project spans 166 sq km (about 10% of the island) and includes four primary pillars:\nInternational Container Transshipment Terminal (ICTT): Located at Galathea Bay, this deep-sea port is the centerpiece. It aims to capture global trade passing through the Malacca Strait, reducing India’s reliance on foreign ports like Colombo and Singapore.\nGreenfield International Airport: A dual-use facility for both civilian tourism and military logistics, capable of handling wide-body aircraft.\nIntegrated Township: Designed to support a future population of over 3.5 lakh people, up from the current 8,000.\nGas & Solar Power Plant: A 450-MVA hybrid plant to provide energy self-sufficiency for the new infrastructure.\nThe island is just 40 nautical miles from one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, Malacca Strait, where 40% of global trade passes. It serves as India’s “first line of defence,\" providing a forward base to monitor naval movements in the Indo-Pacific, particularly countering regional influence from other powers. Currently, 75% of India’s transshipment cargo is handled outside the country. This project aims to bring that revenue and logistical control back to India.\nThe project is being implemented in phases, with the first phase of the port targeted for completion by 2028.\nThe tribunal on February 16 emphasised a “balanced approach,\" ruling that the project’s significance for national security and trade near the Malacca Strait outweighed the grounds for halting it.\nRelying on Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) findings, the NGT noted no major reefs are in the direct project footprint but mandated the translocation of approximately 16,000 coral colonies found nearby. Directives were issued to ensure no loss of sandy beaches, which are critical nesting grounds for the Leatherback sea turtle and the Nicobar megapode.\nThe tribunal concluded that the project does not fall within prohibited Island Coastal Regulation Zone (ICRZ-IA) areas, dismissing petitioners’ claims of regulatory violations.\nThe NGT noted that the government must adhere to welfare conditions for the Shompen (a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group) and Nicobarese communities, though local leaders have alleged coercion in land surrender.\nWhile the NGT has disposed of environmental clearance challenges, the project remains under scrutiny:\nCalcutta High Court: Forest clearance for the project is still being argued.\nEnvironmentalists and political figures, including Jairam Ramesh, have termed the ruling “deeply disappointing,\" warning of “disastrous ecological impacts\" such as the felling of over 10 million trees and the displacement of indigenous tribes.\nWith Agency Inputs\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "Mamata Banerjee Fact-Checked: What Bangladesh Election Data Shows On Minority Representation | Exclusive",
        "content": "Indian intelligence sources have rejected West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s recent remarks citing Bangladesh’s elections in her criticism of the Election Commission of India, saying she does not have complete data about how the neighbouring country’s polls were conducted.\nAddressing the media after polls in the neighbouring country, Banerjee had said: “The election in Bangladesh was concluded peacefully. Everybody thought there will be violence. But it was done peacefully. But while India is a democratic county, its Election Commission with its ‘threat culture’, will bulldoze democracy.\"\nHowever, sources familiar with internal assessments told CNN-News18 that the picture emerging from Bangladesh’s parliamentary elections is far more complex, and troubling, particularly with regard to minority participation and representation.\n‘Deliberate Playbook’\nIntelligence inputs indicate that violence and intimidation targeting Hindus and other minorities continued for over a year, particularly in politically sensitive and border districts. Officials describe what they term a “deliberate playbook\" by certain political actors aimed at inciting anti-minority sentiment, including attacks and pressure tactics designed to discourage participation.\nIn several constituencies, especially in volatile regions such as Bagerhat and Gopalganj, rejections and withdrawals of minority candidates were reportedly higher, pointing to security concerns. Sources allege that in some pockets, minorities were “systematically pushed out of the system\" through a mix of administrative hurdles and intimidation.\nRepresentation Gap In Candidate Numbers\nData from the Bangladesh parliamentary election shows that of 2,034 candidates contesting 299 seats, only 80 were from Hindu minority backgrounds. That represents approximately 3.9 per cent of the total candidate pool, even though Hindus comprise about 8 per cent of Bangladesh’s population—effectively half their demographic share.\nIn several constituencies where Hindu voters account for 15-20 per cent of the electorate, major political parties reportedly did not nominate Hindu candidates.\nMany Hindu aspirants are said to have filed nominations in significant numbers, including in minority-heavy constituencies such as Khulna-1, where eight Hindu nominees initially entered the race. However, some nomination papers were rejected on multiple grounds, while others were allegedly withdrawn under pressure.\nMost of the 80 Hindu candidates were fielded by smaller leftist parties with limited vote share. Only two to three Hindu candidates are believed to have won seats, all on tickets from the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). No major mainstream party is seen to have significantly exceeded proportional representation for Hindu candidates.\nWar Of Words\nBanerjee’s comments, suggesting that India should look at how Bangladesh conducted its polls, sparked immediate backlash from the BJP and drew a firm response from the Election Commission, which defended the country’s electoral processes.\nIntelligence sources now argue that selective comparisons overlook ground realities in Bangladesh, including minority underrepresentation and reported intimidation.\nLatest Blogs",

A copy of the complaint has also been sent to the Maharashtra Chief Minister’s Office.\nThe local residents’ forum, representing over 650 families, said the tune plays daily from 6am to midnight, adding to the existing traffic noise. They have demanded that the BMC discontinue the musical stretch. The civic body is yet to respond.\nThe musical stretch is designed to play the tune ‘Jai Ho’ when vehicles strike precision rumble strips at the correct speed. It was meant to reward safe driving. However, residents in nearby densely populated neighbourhoods say it has become a constant disturbance.\nIn their letter, the Breach Candy ALM and the Breach Candy Residents Forum said the amplified sound enters homes as a constant, muffled but intrusive background noise. Many residents are keeping windows shut. Senior citizens have reportedly expressed serious discomfort.\nResidents said the northbound side of the road is meant for fast-moving traffic. They argue that drivers are getting distracted by listening to the music instead of focusing on the road. Some drivers are slowing down suddenly to hear the tune, which could lead to high-speed crashes or pile-ups.\nThe community said Mumbai already faces constant horn-honking and engine noise. They believe adding amplified music is unnecessary and worsens the noise problem.\nThey also pointed out that the music plays near schools and hospitals, where peace and quiet are important for health and learning. The letter said residents are increasingly fatigued from raising serious civic concerns while avoidable and non-essential interventions receive attention. It added that the deafening noise from speeding supercars on the Coastal Road remains unaddressed.\nResidents have urged the civic administration to immediately review and discontinue the music initiative, calling it disruptive to daily life in the neighbourhood.\nLatest Blogs",

        "title": "'Rumours Have Now Come True': Gaurav Gogoi Alleges Bhupen Borah Leaked Congress's Internal Info",
        "content": "Assam Congress president Gaurav Gogoi on Wednesday launched a sharp attack on former state Congress chief Bhupen Borah, questioning his decision to move towards the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) soon after resigning from the party and alleging that recent developments have validated long-standing suspicions within the Congress about internal information leaks.\nReacting to Borah’s statements and his impending entry into the BJP, Gogoi said Congress leaders had earlier been troubled by how confidential discussions within the party were allegedly reaching individuals close to Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma.\n“We always wondered how confidential details of our meetings were leaked to a particular journalist linked to Himanta Biswa Sarma. We tried our best not to believe in these rumours and speculation, but now these rumours have come to light, and it is true,\" Gogoi said.\nHe further accused Borah of quickly aligning with the BJP leadership after stepping down from the Congress, saying the timing of the move has raised serious political questions.\n“A day after leaving the Congress party, Bhupen Borah has no qualms about joining the BJP and surrendering to Himanta Biswa Sarma. Why, within a day of resignation, did you join Himanta Biswa Sarma?\" Gogoi asked.\nGogoi also dismissed Borah’s criticism of the Congress as a justification for switching sides.\n“All of this is just an excuse to join the BJP. When someone joins the BJP, they are given a script, and they have to read that script,\" he said.\nGogoi added that people across Assam were questioning Borah’s decision to join the BJP instead of another opposition party if he was dissatisfied within the Congress.\n“The people of Assam are thinking that if you are facing difficulties in the Congress party, then why don’t you join some other party that is fighting against the BJP? There are other parties too that are fighting against the BJP. Why did you shake hands with Himanta Biswa Sarma within just one day of resigning?\" he said.\nThe political row comes after Borah resigned from Congress earlier this week, triggering a major churn in Assam politics.\nBorah claimed that the state Congress unit is no longer functioning under Gogoi’s effective leadership and alleged that Dhubri MP Rakibul Hussain has become the party’s “sole base\", while describing Gogoi as merely the “face of the party\".\nBorah also said that the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, spoke to him at length after he submitted his resignation letter, recalling their long political association.\nSenior Congress leaders, including the party’s central leadership, had reached out to persuade him to reconsider his decision, though Borah maintained that he needed time to reflect after more than three decades in the party.\nMeanwhile, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma announced that Borah would formally join the BJP on February 22 after meeting him at his residence, publicly welcoming the former Congress leader and stating that the BJP’s doors remain open to him.\nLatest Blogs",
