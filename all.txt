In a major administrative action, the Punjab government led by Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party leader Bhagwant Mann suspended two senior IAS officers with immediate effect on Saturday (February 7, 2026).
According to official orders, officers Kamal Kishore Yadav and Jaspreet Singh have been suspended.
Although the reasons for their suspension were not specified in the orders, sources said that it stemmed from a six-year delay in procuring smartphones for Anganwadi workers under the Union Government's Mission Saksham Anganwadi.
The vendor selected by the government for providing smartphones had approached the court for the delay, they further said.
Two additional IAS officers are said to have been transferred in connection with this matter, including Vikas Pratap, who was serving as the Additional Chief Secretary for Social Security.
IAS officer Yadav, a 2003-batch IAS officer, was the administrative secretary of the Department of Industries and Commerce, Investment Promotion and Promotion of Information Technology.
Jaspreet Singh, a 2014-batch IAS officer, is the managing director of the Punjab Information and Communication Technology Corporation Limited.
Both officers have been suspended under Rule 3 (1) of the All India Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1969. During the suspension period, they will remain in Chandigarh, as stated in the orders.
Meanwhile, IAS officer Gurkirat Kirpal Singh has been assigned the responsibilities for Industries, Investment Promotion, and Social Security. Singh had been without a posting for the past 11 months.
This is not the first instance of an IAS officer being suspended during the AAP regime. In February 2025, the State government suspended the then Muktsar Deputy Commissioner Rajesh Tripathi following "serious complaints of corruption."
Additionally, in August 2023, senior IAS officers D.K. Tiwari and Gurpreet Singh Khaira were suspended for making a "technically flawed" decision regarding the dissolution of panchayats.

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K.Stalin on Sunday (February 8, 2026) wrote  to Prime Minister Narendra Modi detailing the status of land acquisition for Railway projects in Tamil Nadu and sought his intervention for their speedy execution. He called for timely release of funds for land acquisition and the revival of projects placed in abeyance.
Mr. Stalin said he was constrained to write the letter in the light of some “factually incorrect information” being spread in the media in this regard. In Tamil Nadu, administrative sanctions have been accorded for land acquisition to an extent of 2500.61.06 hectares of land for implementation of various Railway Projects. Of this, Railways have not sanctioned funds for an extent of 931.52.96 hectares of land.
Administrative sanction for land acquisition in respect of two projects for which revised Land Plan Schedule (LPS) was received recently from Railways for an extent of 296.02.95 hectares of private lands are under process and will be issued shortly. Of the balance extent of 1273.05.15 hectares of land pertaining to 19 major ongoing Railway projects, land acquisition have been completed for an extent of 1198.02.34 hectares of lands (94%) and the same have been handed over to the Railways. However, in respect of five projects, the LPS is yet to be furnished by the Railways, the Chief Minister said.
Land acquisition have been fully completed in respect of major Railway Projects such as Tindivanam-Nagari Broad Gauge Line (BGL), Madurai-Thoothukudi BGL, Maniyachi-Nagercoil BGL, Kanniyakumari-Nagercoil doubling of BGL, Nagercoil-Eraniel doubling of BGL, Thoothukudi-Madurai (via Aruppukkottai) new BGL (Phase-I), Chinnasalem-Kallakurichi new BGL, Mayiladuthurai-Tiruvarur BGL, four junction point in Pattukkottai, new BGL (Salem-Karur track formation), Mannargudi-Needamangalam BGL, Chennai Beach-Korukkupet 3/4th line, and Villupuram-Dindigul BGL. For remaining projects, the land acquisition is being carried out expeditiously, the Chief Minister said.
“I wish to highlight that timely payment of compensation to landowners is an essential prerequisite for completing the land acquisition process. Regrettably, delays in the release of funds by the Ministry of Railways, often in piecemeal manner for individual projects have severely hampered progress. This has led to disruptions, prolonged uncertainty for affected landowners and delays in project execution,” Mr. Stalin said.
A pertinent example is the pending acquisition of 16.86.51 hectares for the doubling of Broad-Gauge Railway Line between Thiruvananthapuram–Kanniyakumari project. The Railways is yet to allocate the required funds amounting to ₹ 289.78 crore for settling compensation. This is a major project in Tamil Nadu, also under monitoring through the PMG portal of the Government of India. A lumpsum and timely allocation of funds for land acquisition, rather than piecemeal releases, would enable uninterrupted and expeditious completion of these critical Projects, he said.
According to him, the State government has accorded highest priority to railway projects and established a robust monitoring mechanism. The Chief Secretary and the Transport Secretary regularly convene monthly coordination meetings with Railway officials to resolve implementation bottlenecks and expedite land acquisition for pending projects, he said.
“At this juncture, I would also like to express concern over the relatively limited allocation of new railway projects to Tamil Nadu in recent years. As the second-largest economy in the country and a major hub for manufacturing and industrial growth, Tamil Nadu continues to make substantial contributions to national GDP and exports. The State possesses immense potential to further bolster the nation’s economic progress through enhanced rail connectivity and infrastructure,” he said.
He urged the Prime Minister to intervene and direct the Ministry of Railways to release the required funds for sanctioned projects without delay, preferably in full and on a priority basis, to facilitate smooth land acquisition and compensation processes. He called for reconsidering and restarting important projects kept in abeyance by the Railways such as Thoothukudi - Madurai (Via Aruppukottai) new BGL and Tindivanam - Tiruvannamalai BGL (for which administrative sanctions has already been issued for acquisition of 931.52.96 hectares) and provide necessary funding support.
The State government was fully committed to extending cooperation for the speedy execution of railway projects, he assured.

Tamil Nadu has been identified as one of the top three States in the country, which suffer from heavy losses incurred by State Public Sector Enterprises (SPSEs).
For the year 2022-23, the top three States in this category were Uttar Pradesh (₹32,430 crore), Rajasthan (₹18,814 crore), and Tamil Nadu (₹16,048 crore), according to the volume 1 of the main report of the 16th Finance Commission. These States come under the broad group of non-north-eastern and hilly (non-NEH) States.
As in the case of other non-NEH States, a substantial portion of the losses were concentrated in the power sector. In the year in question, the now-defunct Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) had recorded a loss of about ₹9,192 crore. However, for 2024-25, the recently published Annual Integrated Rating of the Distribution Companies, compiled by the Power Finance Corporation, put the profit after tax (PAT) of the Tamil Nadu Power Distribution Corporation Limited (TNPDCL), one of the successors of the Tangedco, at ₹2,073 crore.
But this had become possible due to the State government’s largesse — the provision of tariff subsidy of ₹15,772 crore and the takeover of loss of ₹16,107 crore. More significantly, the accumulated deficit of the TNPDCL went down to ₹1,19,153 crore in 2024-25 from ₹1,66,944 crore of the Tangedco in 2023-24., thanks to the unbundling of the latter.
Describing the poor financial performance of SPSEs as “a burden on State budgets,” the Finance Commission stated that the State governments had to incur budgetary expenditure in the form of subsidies, grants, equity investments, and loans. Besides, they had to provide guarantees against the loans raised by the SPSEs. The financial support extended by State Governments to SPSEs in the form of equity, loans, and grants/subsidies through the budget during the year 2022-23 amounted to ₹2.5 lakh crore.
The Commission recorded that for 2022-23, the budgetary out go of the Tamil Nadu government to the SPSEs was ₹26,867 crore and till the end of the year in question, the outstanding guarantees stood at ₹89,768 crore.
The Commission did not include Tamil Nadu in the club of States with a high proportion of loss-making enterprises, a matter that provides solace to policy makers and people of the State.

A mysterious gas leak from a cylinder at a scrap dealer’s shop triggered panic in a locality near the Jammu airport on Saturday (February 7, 2026), prompting authorities to rush joint teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) to the scene, officials said.
Several residents of Rani Bagh complained of breathlessness following the sudden leakage of gas from an abandoned cylinder lying at the scrap dealer’s premises, they added.
According to authorities, teams of the NDRF and SDRF, wearing protective gear, along with police and fire and emergency department personnel, reached the scene and successfully contained the leak.
They assured that the situation is well under control and there is no need to panic.
An investigation has been initiated to determine the nature of the gas and how the cylinder ended up at the scrap dealer’s shop, officials noted, adding that the substance will be identified through scientific analysis, and further action will be taken accordingly.
However, officials did not rule out the possibility that the gas could be a hazardous chemical, including sulphur mustard.

Minister for Water Resources and Katpadi MLA Duraimurgan inaugurated a 25-ft high memorial pillar at Mordhana Dam.
T.N. Minister for Water Resources and Katpadi MLA Duraimurgan on Saturday inaugurated a 25-ft high memorial pillar at Mordhana dam, which was built across the Koundinya river, a tributary of the Palar, in Gudiyatham town in Vellore to commemorate 25 years of the existence of the dam that helped to irrigate 8, 367 acres of farmland in the region.
Officials of the Water Resources Department (WRD), which maintains the dam, said that the foundation stone was laid more than three decades ago in December, 1990. when Mr. Duraimurugan was the Minister for Public Works and Forests. A decade later, the dam was inaugurated by former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi in September 2000. “The dam reached its full storage capacity of 261.3 mcft for the tenth time during the 2025 monsoon. The dam also witnessed restoration works during that period,” V. Kalipriyan, Assistant Engineer (AE), WRD (Gudiyatham), told The Hindu.
Accompanied by Collector V.R. Subbulaxmi and Vellore MP D.M. Kathir Anand, Mr. Duraimurugan inspected the canal, protection wall and bund area. “Water from the dam is a lifeline for irrigation and domestic use. It helps to cultivate crops for at least three seasons a year,” said G. Ramu, a farmer.WRD officials said that the restored left canal of the dam runs 31.84 kms distance, covering at least 19 villages with around 1,710.92 hectares of farmland.
The left canal, which is three metres wide, covers a large tract of land under cultivation. Water from the Koundinya river directly irrigates around 140 acres. Another 220 acres in the region are irrigated through water from the left canal of the dam alone. WRD officials said that under the Rehabilitation and Restoration of Lakes scheme 2024-25, the left canal of the dam was taken up for restoration where deposited silt on the canal bed was removed to a depth of three metres to ensure steady water flow on it. Growth of thick vegetation especially on bund and slope of the bund was also removed.
WRD officials said that restoration of the key canal of the dam has helped for storage of excess rainwater in the dam to its full capacity during the 2025 monsoon since 2021 massive floods in the region. Excess water from the dam also overflows to 19 irrigation tanks on the downstream of the river, thereby providing adequate water for farmers in the area for cultivation. On the occasion, S. Pavalakannan, Superintending Engineer (SE), WRD, R. Venkatesh, Executive Engineer (EE), WRD, P. Gopi, Assistant Executive Engineer (AEE), WRD, and S. Ramkumar, AE (WRD) were present.

--------------------
The State government has  earmarked an amount of ₹30 crore in the Budget for ensuring continued treatment facilities for those suffering from Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA).
The government’s interventions in the area of rare diseases began in 2022 with the launch of an SMA pilot project at SAT Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram. The initiative began with the free distribution of Evrysdi – a medication which cost about ₹5.2 lakh – to SMA-afflicted children up to five years of age. In 2023, the coverage was expanded to include children up to seven years of age, according to Cure SMA, a SMA patient collective.
The Kerala United Against  Rare Diseases (KARE) scheme was introduced  in 2024 and  treatment support was further extended to children up to 12 years of age. At present, 110 children across the State are beneficiaries of the programme.
The government is also providing Scoliosis surgery free of cost through the Government Medical College Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram, to correct the spinal curvature
Cure SMA has welcomed the budgetary allocation made by the government for SMA care as it is a great support for parents struggling to ensure the survival and quality of life of  their SMA-afflicted children

--------------------
After years of uncertainty, recent steps by the Central and State governments on the Angamaly-Sabari rail project have rekindled hopes among people along the proposed corridor, despite a section of them sharing fears triggered by bitter experience from the past.
Officials claimed that the project, which remained stalled for over 25 years due to multiple hurdles, had entered the right track, with the State government announcing that it would bear 50% of the cost, including land acquisition expenses, and the Railway Ministry de-freezing the project.
Thousands of families, whose land parcels remain earmarked for the 110-km railway line covering parts of Ernakulam, Idukki and Kottayam districts, hope that with the latest steps their land will be acquired by the government, and that they will be paid due compensation without further delay.
“Unlike earlier, I’m a bit hopeful now,” M.P. Viswanathan Nair, an ex-NRI with an earmarked property in Okkal panchayat, said. He said that the Central and State governments coming together for the project had increased his confidence. He added that he had not been able to sell or mortgage his land ever since it was earmarked for the project. “Those around me who share my fate are also by and large hopeful now, though there are doubts over how much progress will be made before the Assembly elections,” he said.
Salim N.A. of Okkal shared the sentiments. “I’m hopeful too, but I will become confident only once the land acquisition offices are opened,” he said.
Sivan Kizhakkekara from Muvattupuzha, however, sounded pessimistic, though. He termed the latest developments an election stunt. He said even if land acquisition works resumed, he would demand compensation for the physical and mental agony caused by the 25-year delay.
Meanwhile, the Sabari Rail Central Action Council demanded speedy action to acquire land for the project and pay compensation to the affected landowners.
A total of 152 hectares will have to be acquired for the project in Ernakulam as per the revised land acquisition proposal, district officials said. They added that the procedures for land acquisition would resume once the Revenue department issued a notification, which was expected within a week.
The district authorities have also submitted proposals to open two more land acquisition offices, besides the existing one with bare minimum facilities. A total of 55 posts have been proposed for the three offices, officials said.

DMK president and Chief Minister M.K. Stalin said on Saturday that Tamil Nadu should give “zero”-seat tally to the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the Assembly election as the BJP-led Union government had given “zero” to Tamil Nadu in the Union Budget and did not fulfil the genuine demands of the State.
Addressing the South Zone DMK Youth Wing conference near here, Mr. Stalin said Tamil Nadu had been the ‘numero uno’ State in the country in all departments during the last five-year rule of the DMK. “It has been ranked number one in the Union government’s ratings and also by national and international magazines. Tamil Nadu’s progress has no parallel,” he said.
However, Tamil Nadu has got nothing in the Union Budget, belying the anticipation that the poll-bound State would get some benefits from the Union government. Mr. Stalin said all that Tamil Nadu demanded was more funds for disaster management, Metro Rail, drinking water schemes, and railway projects, permission for the new airport in Hosur, 50% devolution of Central funds to the State, exemption from NEET, expedited construction of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Madurai, and the promise of not reducing the number of Lok Sabha seats under delimitation. But nothing has been granted by the Union government. “They gave us zero. The BJP-led NDA should be given zero in the Assembly election, similar to what they got in the 2024 Lok Sabha election,” Mr. Stalin said.
He ridiculed AIADMK general secretary Edappadi K. Palaniswami for claiming that he was the head of the NDA in the State. However, the BJP has made the AIADMK a branch of the national party, and he was not raising his voice in the interest of Tamil Nadu, he alleged.
Mr. Stalin also criticised the AIADMK’s proposed protest against the DMK for preventing the Viksit Bharat-Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB-G RAM G) scheme.
“Does Mr. Palaniswami even know the name of this new scheme? The Union government did not give [funds for providing] jobs even for 50 days when the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme guaranteed jobs for 100 days. How will the Union government ensure that the jobs are given for 125 days as promised, this when the States have been made to contribute 40% of the funds [towards the scheme]?” he asked.
The BJP that has tasted only defeat in the State and the AIADMK, which has seen multiple defeats, should not only be defeated again in the upcoming Assembly election but also with a bigger margin to make the State more progressive, the Chief Minister added.

While the Karnataka government claims that no government school has been closed in the State, two sources of official data indicate that as many as 3,617 government schools were shut down  between 2020-21 and 2025-26.
Data tabled by the Union Ministry of Education in the Rajya Sabha on February 4, in response to a question raised by a CPI(M) member John Brittas regarding school closures across the country, shows that 947 government schools shut down between 2020-21 and 2024-25. It came down from 49,791 in 2020-21 to 48,844 in 2024-25.
Further, an October 15, 2025, order by the Department of School Education and Literacy (DSEL), Karnataka, on establishing Karnataka Public Schools, pegs the number of government schools in the State at 46,174, indicating a drastic decline. Data for 2025-26, which saw the largest closures, pegged at 2,670, is not part of the data tabled in the Rajya Sabha.
DSEL Minister Madhu Bangarappa had earlier claimed in the Karnataka Legislature session that no government school had been permanently closed in 2025-26, but only temporarily shut.
The enrolment of students in government schools in the State has declined from 47.1 lakh in 2015-16 to 38.2 lakh in 2025-26, recording a decline of 19%. The share of government schools in the total enrolment has declined from 46% to 38%.
During the same period, enrolment in private unaided schools increased from 36.3 lakh to 47 lakh, recording an increase of 29%. The number of government schools with an enrolment of 50 or less students has increased to 25,683 in 2025-26. This trend clearly indicates why government schools were shutting down year on year.
However, data tabled by the Union Ministry of Education in the Rajya Sabha shows that even the number of private unaided schools have decreased in Karnataka — from 19,915 in 2020-21 to 19,105 in 2024-25. Data for 2025-26 is not available in the public domain.
Private schools that have not been renewed for Recognition Renewal (RR) are included in the closed schools list, sources said, explaining the anomaly, but also indicating the mushrooming of schools without regulation.
“This year, about 98% of private schools in the State have not renewed their RRs. In addition, schools that have not appointed qualified teachers under the RTE Act and those that have not obtained the religious and linguistic minority certificate from National Commission for Minorities, will not be renewed,” explained developmental educationist V.P. Niranjanaradhya.
“Education is on the concurrent list. Unless a State gets substantial funds from the Union government, none can improve public education. But, year on year, allocation for education from the Union government is declining. Whatever the funds are released, they put a lot of conditions in the name of PM Shree schools, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan. Unless you comply with the National Education Policy (NEP-2020), funds are not released. RTE is a Central legislation. The share of Central and State funds for the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, which was 90:10 earlier, has now come down to 60:40. This should be reversed,” he said.

--------------------
Tejasvi Surya
Amidst a political slugfest over who is responsible for the Namma Metro fare hike, at least two BJP leaders from the city on Saturday claimed that the Union government had intervened and put the proposed fare hike on hold at their behest. Tejasvi Surya, MP for Bengaluru South, and Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly R. Ashok claimed the revised fares will not come into effect from February 9, as was scheduled.
However, Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL) told The Hindu that they had received no such communication. “We can decide only when official communication comes to us. So far, we have not received any communication,” a senior BMRCL official said.
This has created confusion whether the new fares will come into effect from Monday or not.
Mr. Surya and Mr. Ashok on Saturday claimed to have spoken to Union Minister of Power and Housing and Urban Affairs Manohar Lal Khattar flagging the issue and that he had directed officials to put the implementation of the revised fares on hold.
Mr. Surya claimed that Mr. Khattar assured a review of anomalies in the Fare Fixation Committee’s (FFC) recommendations and indicated that a fresh FFC could be considered if the State government submits a formal request. Soon after Mr. Surya’s claim, Mr. Ashok claimed in a post shared on X that he too had a chat with Mr. Khattar and the Minister had made similar assurances.
Both the leaders put the ball in the State government’s court. “It is now up to the State government to act in the interest of the people. The Congress government led by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah must immediately abandon its rigid and insensitive approach and initiate the process of forming a new Fare Fixation Committee (FFC),” Mr. Ashok said.
Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had, in a statement issued on Friday, put the onus on the Union government to fix Namma Metro fares and the State was bound to implement the fares recommended by the FFC, an independent committee.
Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar claimed the State was not even consulted on fare revision. Contradictin this, Mr. Surya claimed it was based on letters from the State that the FFC was formed. Union Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy alleged that the State government was trying to mislead people and the Centre’s share in BMRCL was only 20%.
The BMRCL had, on Thursday, announced a zone-wise fare revision under its Annual Automatic Fare Revision mechanism, with the revised fares scheduled to take effect from February 9. The new structure involves a marginal increase of ₹1 to ₹5 across 10 fare zones, with fares recalibrated based on distance slabs across the Namma Metro network.
The announcement triggered strong backlash from commuters, as it came on the back of last year’s sharp fare hike. On February 9, 2025, BMRCL implemented a steep fare increase, with some slabs witnessing hikes of over 100%, leading to widespread protests across Bengaluru. Following public outrage, BMRCL later said the anomaly was due to technical issues in the fare calculation and capped the hike at 71% from February 14, 2025.
As commuter anger resurfaced after Thursday’s announcement, the issue soon turned into a political slugfest between the BJP and the Congress, with both sides trying to blame the other over the fare hike.

In a big reform, the State government has introduced auto-conversion of land use in the notified Master Plan area within the Greater Bengaluru Authority (GBA) area. Now, one can directly apply for a plan approval as per the Master Plan, and conversion will be done as part of the process automatically. A new software to facilitate the same was launched by Revenue Minister Krishna Byre Gowda on Saturday.
“With the enabling provision of auto conversion, GBA now has the legal framework to convert B-Khata properties into A-Khata,” Mr. Byre Gowda said, adding that this will help lakhs of property owners who have purchased unauthorised sites in the past. Getting A Khatha will add legal strength to such sites, enable them to obtain loans, increase the value of their property, ease transactions, and approvals.
GBA is now running a one-time scheme to issue A-Khata to B-Khata properties, if the site owner pays 5% of the guidance value. Deputy Chief Minister and Bengaluru Development Minister D.K. Shivakumar recently said that the GBA had received 1.2 lakh applications, of which 45,000 had been rejected.
Earlier, even lands falling within the Master Plan required separate conversion, despite the concept of “deemed conversion.” This process typically took 4 to 6 months and often led to delays, harassment, corruption, and increased costs due to middlemen, Mr. Byre Gowda himself acknowledged.
“The auto conversion of land is intended to help legal, faster, and easier development of land. Thus, help common people to buy affordable sites. Ease of governance and compliance is hoped to reduce the cost and time of land development. This will benefit not only residential development, but is also available to industrial and other uses as permitted in the Master Plan. With this reform, the Revenue Department is hoping to plug bad governance and corruption at the source itself,” he said.
“By bringing online transparent time-bound and automatic processes, discretion is reduced. All these steps, along with E-Khata and integration of different records, will reduce litigation and bring greater guarantee to property ownership,” he further said.

TITLE: Karnataka High Court confirms death penalty for three men in gang rape and murder of minor

--------------------
The High Court of Karnataka has confirmed the death sentence for three men convicted of the gang rape and murder of an eight-year-old girl at a tile factory in Mangaluru, declaring the 2021 crime as a “rarest of rare” cases.
A Division Bench comprising Justice H.P. Sandesh and Justice Venkatesh Naik T. in its February 4 verdict has dismissed the appeals of the convicts, identified as Jayban Adivasi and Mukesh Singh, both natives of Madhya Pradesh, and Manish Thirki, a native of Jharkhand, and upheld the capital punishment awarded by a Mangaluru special court for cases registered under the provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, in November 2024.
The incident occurred on November 21, 2021, on the premises of the tile factory where both the victim’s parents, who are natives of Jharkhand, and the accused persons worked.
The Bench found sufficient evidence to establish that the men, in a premeditated conspiracy, lured the child with sweets, took her to a secluded room on the tile factory premises, and subjected her to sequential rape and assault. And when she cried out due to bleeding injuries, Jayban Adivasi smothered her to death. Three of them then concealed her body in a drainage, the Bench noted.
The Bench affirmed the conviction by analysing a chain of circumstantial evidence, statements of eyewitnesses who had seen the victim girl with the three accused, conclusive DNA evidence linking the men to the crime, recovery of blood-stained clothing, and CCTV camera footage. The Bench noted the presence of chewed food particles in the victim’s teeth, corroborating the prosecution’s claim that she was lured with sweets.
Assessing the materials on record, the Bench said that “there are no mitigating circumstances favouring the accused to reduce the sentence, since it is a gangrape of a minor girl, who was aged about 7 years and 7 months at the time of commission of the offence”.
“If a lesser sentence is imposed, it will give a wrong message to society and the public at large, and this act of subjecting the minor girl to satisfy their lust would be encouraged as such act has to be curbed with iron hands,” the Bench observed.
The trial against another man, Munim Singh, a resident of Madhya Pradesh, who is arraigned as accused number-4 in the case, is pending as he absconded after obtaining bail from Mangaluru court before trial began.

Union Minister for Railways Ashwini Vaishnaw on Saturday said that electrification work on the Hassan–Mangaluru section is currently under way, paving the way for the launch of the Bengaluru–Mangaluru Vande Bharat train service. Once electrification is completed, train services will be introduced on the Karwar–Mangaluru–Bengaluru route, significantly improving rail connectivity to Karnataka’s coastal region.
Addressing a press conference at the BJP office in Bengaluru, Mr. Vaishnaw said, “Karnataka is witnessing major railway modernisation. This includes the redevelopment of 51 Amrit Bharat railway stations at an estimated cost of ₹2,110 crore, alongside the operation of 12 Vande Bharat trains in the State”.
Referring to projects announced in the Union Budget recently, the Minister said that the proposed high-speed rail corridors connecting Bengaluru with Chennai and Hyderabad would enhance connectivity among three of South India’s key economic centres. “Once operational, the travel time between Bengaluru and Chennai is expected to reduce to 73 minutes, while the Bengaluru–Hyderabad journey would take around two hours,” he said.
On the long-pending Bengaluru suburban railway project, Mr. Vaishnaw said that the work on all four phases is progressing. Dedicated suburban tracks will be built alongside existing railway lines, and a new design framework has been finalised to expedite execution of the project.

--------------------
World-class cancer care facilities will be available under one roof in central Kerala with the commissioning of the new building complex of the Cochin Cancer Research Centre (CCRC), constructed at a cost of ₹449 crore.
Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will inaugurate the facility on Monday. Health Minister Veena George and Industries Minister P. Rajeeve will be present on the occasion.
The CCRC will be a valuable addition to the cancer care landscape of Kerala, which already boasts two major premier cancer care institutions in the public sector—the RCC in Thiruvananthapuram and MCC in Thalassery.
The CCRC will provide advanced and high-quality cancer care, marking a significant milestone in Kerala’s efforts to establish the best of cancer treatment and research in the State. The facility will be a source of great relief to hundreds of cancer patients in central Kerala who would not have to travel far to access care.
The CCRC has been developed on 12.63 acres within the Kalamassery Medical College campus, comprising nine buildings with a total built-up area of 6.3 lakh square feet.
The new building complex has 16 elevators, sophisticated and modern operation theatres, and parking facilities for 550 vehicles. It houses 12 fully equipped operation theatres designed for complex surgeries, including one reserved exclusively for future robotic surgical procedures.
The CCRC will also place a huge thrust on cancer research in the State, with a 10,000 square feet area allocated exclusively for research activities.
The new complex is equipped with sophisticated facilities for scanning, X-ray, radiation therapy, and other critical services, integrated with AI-led technologies.
It is the first hospital building in Kerala to receive EDGE certification. All current power requirements of the building will be met through solar energy, making it a green building that is 25% carbon-neutral. It also hopes to attain full carbon neutrality by 2050, aligning with the State government’s aspirations for the same.

--------------------
Concerns have been raised over the government’s move to reduce the number of working days of government offices to five a week. It is feared that the decision would make it harder for the public to access administrative services.
National Janata Dal district leader K.U. Irshad described the move irrational. He warned that it could trigger public resentment at a time when people were already forced to make repeated visits to offices even for minor matters.
He said that in institutions such as village offices, panchayats, taluk offices and collectorates, people often have to wait for days to complete procedures related to certificates, land records, welfare scheme applications and pension processing.
The situation in courts is also worrying, he said, pointing to a large backlog of cases, including many that have been pending for years in consumer and family courts.
“When procedures cannot be completed on time even with six working days a week, reducing working days will only push people into greater hardship,” said Mr. Irshad.
He noted that despite the widespread introduction of digital services, problems such as delays in file movement, unnecessary procedural complexities and unequal access to services continued to persist.
Any move to cut working days would send a wrong message to society, he said. “Priority should instead be given to improving the quality and efficiency of public services,” he said. Mr. Irshad demanded that the government reconsider its decision.

BJP president Nitin Nabin on Saturday (February 7, 2026) said the Union Budget 2026 has brought substantial gains to Kerala, with a sharp increase in the State’s tax devolution and Central grants, besides major allocations for infrastructure and railway development.
He was speaking at a discussion on the Union Budget organised by BJP Intellectual Cell here. Mr. Nabin said Kerala has received special consideration in railway development, including the allocation of Vande Bharat and Amrit Bharat trains.
On Kerala’s development, Mr. Nabin said the Union government is guided by Deendayal Upadhyaya’s philosophy of Antyodaya, which focusses on serving the last person in society. Benefits for agricultural sectors such as cashew and cocoa would reach Kerala, he said.
He said Kerala’s share in tax devolution has increased by 33%, amounting to around ₹8,973 crore, while Central grants doubled from ₹13,000 crore to ₹26,000 crore.
“The Centre shows no parsimony when it comes to development of Kerala,” he asserted.
Highlighting welfare schemes, Mr. Nabin said 1.55 crore beneficiaries in Kerala are covered under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana, 85 lakh people have Ayushman Bharat cards, 28 lakh farmers benefit from PM-Kisan, and over 10,000 Jan Aushadhi centres are functioning in the State. He also said the Centre is strengthening coastal shipping and inland waterways, which would provide economic support to the coastal State.
Mr. Nabin said the Prime Minister’s efforts to revive cultural centres such as Kashi and Ujjain have boosted tourism significantly, and similar support for Kerala’s heritage would energise the local economy. He reaffirmed the BJP’s commitment to protecting Kerala’s cultural heritage, including the sanctity of Sabarimala.
Expressing concern over radicalism, Mr. Nabin said Kerala is passing through a difficult phase that has impacted local businesses. A secure environment is essential for business growth, and the BJP would not compromise on national security, he said.
Drawing a parallel with Bihar’s improved business climate under the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), he said the BJP aims to transform Kerala into an investor-friendly State. “Under Narendra Modi’s leadership, I assure you that a BJP government will be formed in Kerala in 2026,” he said, adding that the party is committed to building a developed Kerala as part of a developed India by 2047.
State president Rajeev Chandrasekhar, State general secretaries A.S. Suresh and Shobha Surendran, along with other party leaders and representatives from various walks of life, participated in the programme.

in the face of poor implementation of the plan and inability to offer basic infrastructure at the location of resettlement, the J&K government has decided that “58 existing hamlets within the Dal Lake will be developed as ‘eco-hamlets’.” File

The Jammu and Kashmir government has abandoned the ₹416.72-crore resettlement plan for Dal Lake dwellers. To a question from National Conference (NC) legislator Tanvir Sadiq, it told the J&K Assembly that the project achieved “only 27% progress” in 17 years.
The plan was conceived by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress leader Sonia Gandhi to preserve and restore the lake, which attracts tourists from across the globe. The Singh government approved the plan in 2009.
The project sought to relocate and rehabilitate around 9,000 families from the Dal Lake ecosystem to tackle growing pollution, mitigate impact on aquatic life and preserve the shrinking lake.
However, in the face of poor implementation of the plan and inability to offer basic infrastructure at the location of resettlement, the J&K government has decided that “58 existing hamlets within the Dal Lake will be developed as ‘eco-hamlets’.”
“Work on six hamlets has already been taken up under the UT Capex budget, with one – Kachri Mohalla – already completed as a modern village,” the J&K government told the Assembly.
According to the new plan, an in-situ conservation model will replace the old scheme, and “residents will be allowed to stay in ‘eco-hamlets’ developed within the water body”.
The shift in the policy has come in the wake of a report submitted by a high-level committee, headed by the Divisional Commissioner of Kashmir, last year. It described the Dal Lake dwellers as an “integral part of the lake ecosystem”. The committee called for the continued stay of these dwellers on the lake, while also stating that it was “equally important to keep it [the lake] vibrant, dynamic and lively”.
The government claimed that a sewerage network for six hamlets had been laid, and detailed project reports for modular sewage treatment plants were under preparation. A ₹212.38-crore project, named ‘Integrated Management Programme for conservation of Dal-Nigeen Lake ecosystem’, had been accepted in principle by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, it said.
The five-year project aimed to address sewerage in 28 internal hamlets, treat inflow from catchment areas and dredge interior channels, the reply stated, adding that it awaited the final approval from the Finance Department.
Under the ManmohanSingh government’s plan, 7,526 kanals of land were acquired at Bemina in the outskirts of Srinagar, and the colony was named Rakh-e-Arth Resettlement Colony. Each Dal Lake dweller was issued a land plot, ₹1.05 lakh for structure and ₹3.91 lakh as one-time compensation. However, the project re-settled only 1,808 families of around 9,000 Dal lake families, officials said.

Chandrababu Naidu and Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Science and Technology Jitendra Singh laying the foundation stone for Amaravati Quantum Valley, at Uddandarayunipalem in the capital region on Saturday. Union Minister P. Chandra Sekhar and IT Minister N. Lokesh are seen.
Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu on Saturday described the laying of the foundation for the Amaravati Quantum Valley (AQV) as a historic moment not only for the State but also for the country, asserting that the initiative would place India at the forefront of global quantum revolution.
The foundation stone for the first integrated quantum valley ecosystem was laid by Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Science and Technology Jitendra Singh and Mr. Naidu, at Uddandarayunipalem in Amaravati, where Quantum Valley Towers would be built in 50 acres.
Addressing the gathering on the occasion, Mr. Naidu said, “It marks more than the construction of buildings, as it also symbolises the creation of a strong base of global talent that will drive the quantum transition in the decades to come.”
Noting that the United Nations had declared 2025 as the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology (IYQ), Mr. Naidu said quantum technology would become a critical pillar as technological capabilities expanded worldwide.
While India had missed the agricultural and industrial revolutions, it had successfully embraced the IT revolution, he observed.
Comparing it with the Hitec City in Hyderabad, which then was a game-changer, the Chief Minister asserted that Amaravati would be developed on similar lines as a global hub for quantum technology.
Mr. Naidu said the AQV would emerge as a centre for quantum designs, products and intellectual property, with research spanning defence, healthcare, energy, finance and climate modelling. He expressed the confidence that global discourse would soon shift from Silicon Valley in the U.S. to Quantum Valley in Amaravati.
Highlighting the unique land pooling model adopted for building the capital city, with farmers as key stakeholders, the Chief Minister thanked the IBM, TCS and L&T for partnering with the State government to establish India’s first 133-qubit quantum computer centre.
Mr. Jitendra Singh, in his address, lauded Mr. Naidu’s long-term vision. “The Chief Minister has planned for technologies that will shape the future decades in advance,” he said. The Union government had launched the National Quantum Mission with an allocation of ₹6,000 crore to position India as a global technology leader, he added.
“Amaravati will become a hub not only for quantum computers but also for quantum professionals, with advanced research in defence, healthcare and finance,” he said, adding that B.Tech courses in quantum studies were already underway and M.Tech programmes would be launched soon.

TITLE: Modi Govt Kicks Off Mega Dam Project On Chenab After Pausing Indus Treaty With Pakistan | Exclusive
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/modi-govt-kicks-off-mega-dam-project-on-chenab-after-pausing-indus-treaty-with-pakistan-exclusive-9887566.html
--------------------
India has started work on the mega Rs 5,129 crore worth Sawalkote Hydroelectric Project on the River Chenab in Jammu and Kashmir—the first such new project to get the green light from the Narendra Modi government after the abrogation of the Indus Water Treaty.
News18 has accessed the documents of the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) Limited inviting companies on February 5 to build this mega project in the Udhampur and Ramban districts of Jammu and Kashmir. The Sawalkote Hydroelectric Project, which in Stage One will see a 1,406 MW project coming up and a 450 MW project in Stage Two, is located on the Chenab River between the Baglihar Project to its upstream and the Salal Project to its downstream. This will be a “run of the river" project.
“Construction methodology and selection of equipment have been planned with the aim to commission the project as early as possible," reveal the documents accessed by News18, showing the urgency. Acting swiftly on projects of strategic significance following the suspension of the Indus Water Treaty, an expert committee of the environment ministry cleared the 1,856 MW project last October. Now, NHPC has invited bids to build it.
The documents say that the major construction works shall start after necessary initial mobilisation. “Available working season in a year in the project area shall be 12 months for all underground works & for surface works with full progress rate during non-monsoon period and with 50% progress rate in monsoon period."
The project could take 9 years to complete, as per the documents.
News18 reported last month that the Centre has issued firm directions to fast-track four major hydropower projects on the Chenab river system. Officials had been asked to commission the Pakal Dul and Kiru projects by December 2026, complete the Kwar project by March 2028, and accelerate construction on the strategically sensitive Ratle Dam.
The most consequential of the projects is the Pakal Dul hydropower project in Kishtwar. At 1,000 MW, it is the largest project in the Chenab basin and, at 167 metres, the highest dam in India. Crucially, it is India’s first storage project on a western river that flows into Pakistan. Built on a tributary of the Chenab, the project was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in May 2018.
With the Indus Waters Treaty effectively in abeyance, the Centre has now ordered that Pakal Dul be commissioned by December 2026. Once operational, it will give India the ability not just to generate power but to regulate the timing of water flows—a capability Pakistan has long viewed with concern.
Running parallel is the Kiru project, also located in the Kishtwar district. The Kiru Dam, rising 135 metres on the Chenab, is a run-of-the-river project, but its strategic value lies in how it fits into a chain of projects upstream and downstream.
The Centre has set the same December 2026 deadline for Kiru, making it clear that both projects are expected to come online together.
The third pillar of this push is the Kwar project, another run-of-the-river dam on the Chenab with a height of 109 metres. A major engineering milestone was achieved in January 2024 when the Chenab was successfully diverted to enable construction. That diversion was closely tracked in Pakistan. The Centre has now directed that Kwar be commissioned by March 2028, locking in a firm timeline.
Then there is the Ratle project, perhaps the most contentious of them all. The 850 MW project involves a 133-metre-high dam on the Chenab and has been opposed by Pakistan for years, particularly over the design of its spillways. During his recent visit, the Power Minister laid the foundation stone for the dam’s concreting works, signalling that Ratle is now being fast-tracked. The Chenab was diverted through tunnels for this project in 2024, and the dam is expected to be ready by 2028.
Beyond these headline projects, India is also moving ahead with Dulhasti Stage-2 on the Chenab. The project received clearance from the Environment Ministry’s panel last December and will come up after Dulhasti-I, which is already operational. Pakistan has recently objected to this clearance as well, arguing it was not informed—an objection India has rejected.
The Chenab is part of the Indus basin—Pakistan’s lifeline. Nearly three-fourths of Pakistan’s water originates from the western rivers that flow from India into Pakistan. Over 90 per cent of Pakistan’s agriculture depends on this basin, and almost the entire network of its dams and canals is built around it. In effect, nine out of ten Pakistanis rely on water that first flows through Indian territory.
India has skipped all Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) proceedings following the Pahalgam attack.

TITLE: India Could Be One Of The Best Choices For Legal Migration To Europe: Greek Defence Minister
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/india-could-be-one-of-the-best-choices-for-legal-migration-to-europe-greek-defence-minister-9887619.html
--------------------
Greek Defence Minister Nikos Dendias on Saturday said India and the wider Indian subcontinent could become among Europe’s most viable partners for legal migration, as the continent grapples with an ageing population and shrinking workforce.
Speaking at the India-EU Forum 2026 in New Delhi, Dendias described migration as a long-standing global reality and stressed the need for Europe to design structured and balanced migration pathways to address its demographic challenges.
“Migration is a global phenomenon. It existed in the past and will continue in the future," he said, adding that Europe’s population growth is “almost negative," creating an urgent demand for younger workers.
Against this backdrop, he noted that the Indian subcontinent’s demographic profile makes it a strong candidate for legal migration partnerships.
“With its current population structure, the subcontinent could be one of the best choices for legal migration," Dendias said, while noting that such frameworks must be carefully designed to ensure mutual benefits for both countries of origin and destination.
The Greek minister also flagged concerns over illegal migration, calling it a destabilising challenge fuelled by organised human smuggling networks.
He urged stronger international cooperation to counter what he described as a large-scale, profit-driven criminal activity.
Beyond migration, Dendias reflected on the historical and cultural links between Greece and India, referencing Alexander the Great’s expedition to the region.
He described India as an enduring presence in Greek mythology and suggested that contemporary cooperation offers an opportunity to renew and deepen bilateral ties.
The inaugural India-EU Forum, organised by the Ministry of External Affairs in partnership with the Ananta Centre, concluded on Saturday after two days of discussions on trade, security, technology and geopolitics.
Held from February 6 to 7, the Track 1.5 forum brought together more than 200 policymakers, industry leaders and strategic experts from India and European Union member states.
External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar delivered the opening address on February 6, while Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal participated in a special session the same day. Nikos Dendias addressed a dedicated fireside chat on February 7.

TITLE: ‘Didn't Mean To Insult': MP Minister Apologises Again For Remarks On Col Sofiya Qureshi
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/didnt-mean-to-insult-mp-minister-apologises-again-for-remarks-on-col-sofiya-qureshi-9887409.html
--------------------
Madhya Pradesh Tribal Affairs Minister Kunwar Vijay Shah has offered another apology for his objectionable remarks against Colonel Sofiya Qureshi amid a Supreme Court-mandated deadline for his prosecution, saying he did not intend to insult a woman officer.
In May last year, Shah sparked a political row for his remarks against Col Qureshi, who became one of the most prominent faces of media briefings when India launched Operation Sindoor against terror hideouts in Pakistan. In a viral video, Shah was seen referring to the woman army officer as a “sister of terrorists".
His remarks were widely criticised by political leaders, and an FIR was filed against him. Speaking to reporters on Saturday, Shah said he had never intended to insult a woman officer, the armed forces or any section of society.
“I have said this many times earlier, and I am reiterating it today that I did not intend to insult any woman officer, the Indian Army or any section of society," he was quoted as saying by NDTV, adding that his remarks were made in a “moment of patriotic excitement".
“It is extremely painful for me that such a controversy arose due to a small error on my part. I believe my feelings will be seen in the right context. I have always had immense respect for the Indian Army and will continue to do so," he added.
Shah said maintaining “decorum and sensitivity of words" was extremely important in the public and vowed to exercise control over his speech in the future. The Madhya Pradesh High Court had ordered the police to file an FIR against him last year for the controversial remarks.
Supreme Court Raps MP Govt For Delay
On January 19, the Supreme Court pulled up the Madhya Pradesh government to he delay in granting permission to prosecute Shah for his remarks. The bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) Surya Kant, Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Joymalya Bagchi directed the state government to take a call on the grant of sanction to prosecute Shah.
“You are sitting over the SIT report since August 19, 2025. The statute casts an obligation on you and you must take a call. It is January 19 now," CJI Kant remarked.
On July 28, 2025, the top court had pulled up Shah for not placing a public apology over his remarks on record against Col Qureshi, saying he was “testing the court’s patience". It had pointed out that the minister’s conduct was prompting it to doubt his intentions and bonafide.
The FIR was registered against Shah under sections 152, 196(1)(b) and 197(1)(c) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS). Since the top court’s view last month, the Congress has demanded Shah’s resignation from the Madhya Pradesh cabinet.

TITLE: 'If Intent Is Pure...': Piyush Goyal Credits PM Modi's 'Masterclass' For India-US Trade Deal
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/if-intent-is-pure-piyush-goyal-credits-pm-modis-masterclass-for-india-us-deal-ws-l-9887017.html
--------------------
Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal on Saturday credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “masterclass" and US President Donald Trump’s leadership in securing a landmark India-US trade deal, emphasising that the two countries share a good relationship and mutual respect.
Speaking in an exclusive interview with CNN-News18, Goyal said it was PM Modi and Trump’s leadership that gave impetus to the trade deal and helped smooth engagement between the two sides. “If your intent is pure, if you believe in fair play on both sides and respect each other’s sensitivities, and are committed to the well-being of your nation while recognising strengths, it leads to mutual understanding," he said.
He called the deal a powerful “win-win" arrangement for both countries to strengthen trade engagement. “When we look at the $30 trillion US economy and the $4 trillion Indian economy that is rapidly growing to become a $30 trillion economy in 2047, we both collectively provide a force multiplier, which helps us achieve the target of $500 billion purchases in five years," he said.
His remarks came after an interim deal between India and the US was announced on Saturday, culminating months of negotiations amid tariff-related tensions. The deal provides for a reduction in reciprocal US tariffs on Indian goods to 18 per cent.
PM Modi’s ‘Masterclass’
Goyal further lauded PM Modi, calling him a “pragmatic leader" who recognises India’s comparative strengths and the sensitive areas, such as farmers and fishermen. “This unique and clear understanding of PM Modi has helped us navigate the whole process," he added.
He compared PM Modi to a “masterclass" who is very practical and offers real-life solutions. “Over the last 12 years of working with him, we have all actually grown in terms of our understanding of principles of negotiation, and our understanding of how to look at the best interests of your nation. Most important is his holistic thinking," he told CNN-News18.
The Commerce Minister said India’s focus is on acquiring ICT products, data centres and quantum computing equipment from the US to become an international player in modern-day technological areas.
India-US Ties
He also asserted that India shares a good relationship with the United States, who respected each other’s sensitive areas. He also rejected criticism that the deal could affect Indian farmers, adding that several Indian exports are facing zero tariffs.
He also said he foresaw no problems with the US in the future, citing the friendly relations between the two sides and the fact that teams had finalised all matters after months of negotiations. “We are not that much apart in terms of our abilities to conclude a good deal. We are not competitors, we complement each other. We respect each other’s sensitivities. Both leaders guided teams," he added.
He said India was already self-sufficient in rice, wheat, sugar, soyabean, corn, GM products, poultry, millets, certain fruits and green peas, groundnuts and non-alcoholic beverages. These products that were sensitive for the farmers and were protected under the new deal. “On other products, there has been a calibrated opening. In many cases, there has been some phasing out over a period of time and tariff rate quotas have been given."
Goyal expressed confidence that the trade deal could generate several opportunities for collaboration between the two countries.

TITLE: Prescription For Crises: Govt May Ask Pharma Firms To Fund Free Medicines For Emergencies
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/prescription-for-crises-govt-may-ask-pharma-firms-to-fund-free-medicines-for-emergencies-9885630.html
--------------------
India is examining a proposal to mandate pharmaceutical companies to set aside a share of their profits for free medicines during health emergencies, News18 learned.
The proposal seeks an amendment to the Drugs Rules, 1945, to include a mandatory provision requiring pharmaceutical companies to spend “at least one per cent of their net profit for providing free medicines in medicine bank" to be used by the central government during “health emergencies, disaster or any other circumstances considered necessary".
The proposal is still under deliberation and has been placed before the country’s top statutory decision-making body on technical matters related to drugs and cosmetics, the Drugs Technical Advisory Board.
The move, according to the agenda document accessed by News18, is being examined to assess whether emergency access to free medicines can be strengthened through regulatory changes without conflicting with company law.
The proposal was deliberated at DTAB’s 90th meeting held on January 25, 2024, after which the board recommended that the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare may seek the opinion of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs on the matter.
Subsequently, comments were received from the corporate affairs ministry, which flagged legal constraints. The agenda document notes that “the broad framework for CSR is laid down under Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013", along with Schedule VII of the Act and the Companies (CSR Policy) Rules, 2014.
It further clarifies that “the Government does not issue specific direction or intervention in the manner or geographical area in which companies choose to spend their CSR funds", highlighting limits on directing CSR expenditure through sector-specific rules.
The corporate affairs ministry has indicated that any attempt to mandate CSR-linked spending through drug regulations would need to be legally aligned with company law. The document states that “CSR is governed by Companies Act, 2013," and therefore suggests that “the authority for CSR activity may be quoted from Schedule VII, Companies Act, 2013 and Companies (CSR Policy) Rules, 2014 and proposed amendment in Drugs Rules, 1945 need to be in sync".
More significantly, it cautions that “any amendment in the CSR framework would require an amendment to the Companies Act", suggesting that changes through the Drugs Rules alone may not be sufficient.
The matter has now been placed back before DTAB, with the agenda concluding that “DTAB may kindly deliberate and give its recommendations in the matter".
The matter continues to be reviewed, with regulators weighing public health needs against existing corporate law provisions.

India clinched the U-19 World Cup title for a record-extending sixth time after defeating England by 100 runs in the final held in Harare, Zimbabwe.
With this win, India strengthened their position as the most successful team in the history of the U-19 World Cup.
A major highlight of the final was opener Vaibhav Sooryavanshi, who delivered a brilliant performance on the biggest stage of his young career. The teenage batter scored a stunning century, reaching the milestone in just 55 balls and playing a key role in India’s dominant win.
The 14-year-old Sooryavanshi smashed a record 80-ball 175, an innings comprising an astonishing 15 fours and 15 sixes as India also broke the record for the highest total ever in a U19 World Cup final. His innings is also the highest individual score in a summit clash of the tournament.

TITLE: Rent Promises, Red Flags & Runaway Dues: Saket Court Seeks Police Report On '32nd Milestone' Project Promoters
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/rent-promises-red-flags-runaway-dues-saket-court-seeks-police-report-on-32nd-milestone-project-promoters-9885011.html
--------------------
What began as a promise of guaranteed rentals and glossy commercial returns has now landed the promoters of Gurugram’s “32nd Milestone" project in a Delhi courtroom, with a magistrate seeking a detailed police response to allegations of cheating, fund diversion, and large-scale financial irregularities.
A Judicial Magistrate First Class at Saket Courts has issued notice on an application seeking registration of an FIR and a slew of stringent measures against the promoters and entities behind the commercial project, including freezing of bank accounts, a forensic audit of finances, suspension of passports, and issuance of Look Out Circulars. The order was passed on February 5 by JMFC Devanshi Janmeja, directing the police to file an Action Taken Report (ATR). The matter is scheduled for further hearing on March 13.
The application has been moved by investor Arvind Gupta, who has accused the promoters of financial misconduct, cheating, and siphoning of investors’ funds. Action has been sought against M/s 32nd Vistas Private Limited, Growth Hospitality LLP, and their promoters, including Dhruv Dutt Sharma, Shirin Sharma, Mamta Sharma, and others.
According to the complaint, the investor had purchased a commercial unit in the project after being assured that the unit would be demarcated shortly. The promoters allegedly offered guaranteed lease rentals for a period of 30 years, along with a buyback option at any stage if the investor chose to exit. A leasing arrangement was subsequently executed, under which the unit was placed on a long-term lease with assurances of regular monthly rental income.
However, the complaint alleges that lease rental payments stopped from August 2025 onwards. It further claims that the promoters failed to deposit Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) from September 2024 and defaulted on GST dues, statutory filings, and employee-related contributions such as ESI and PF, allegedly causing losses to investors, employees, and the public exchequer.
The complainant has alleged that investors were repeatedly told that rental payments and TDS deposits had already been credited but were not reflecting due to “technical issues", claims that later turned out to be false. It is further alleged that fabricated TDS certificates were circulated among investors to create the impression that statutory deposits had been made, despite no such entries appearing in official records.
When the investor sought demarcation and possession of the purchased unit or invoked the buyback option, the promoters allegedly expressed their inability to hand over possession. The application suggests that one possible reason could be multiple sales of the same commercial units.
Serious allegations of diversion and siphoning of funds have also been raised. The plea claims that despite earning rental income from operational restaurants and commercial establishments at the project, the promoters failed to clear dues owed to investors, employees, financial institutions, and statutory authorities. It is also alleged that substantial borrowings were raised from banks and private investors and were misused.
The application further states that protests have been taking place outside the project premises, offices have allegedly been shut, and essential utilities such as electricity and water supply disconnected due to non-payment of dues, while the promoters are claimed to be untraceable.
Concerns have also been raised regarding alleged expenditure on promotional campaigns and high-profile endorsements. The plea refers to associations involving public figures such as Malaika Arora, Abhay Deol, Karan Johar, Manish Malhotra, and Akshay Kumar, and seeks investigation into the financial trail of such promotional spending at a time when investor dues allegedly remain unpaid. No allegations have been levelled against these celebrities, and the plea confines itself to examining the source of funds used for such promotions.
On these grounds, the application seeks registration of an FIR, attachment of assets, forensic audit of accounts, suspension of passports of the promoters, and issuance of Look Out Circulars to prevent them from leaving the country.
Taking note of the allegations, the Saket court has directed the police to submit a detailed status report and listed the matter for further consideration on March 13.
The company has said in a statement that recent delays in rental payments have been driven by a short-term vacancy in a limited portion of its Gurugram property, arising from normal tenant churn and a change in tenancy, and that “replacement leasing is already underway and being prioritised".
Notably, the legal action in Delhi follows recent FIRs registered by Gurugram Police against the owner and certain officials associated with “32nd Avenue", the popular retail and entertainment hub, after investor protests.

LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/in-rare-move-delhi-police-book-ips-officer-others-over-illegal-detention-unauthorised-raids-9884615.html
--------------------
Delhi Police’s vigilance unit has registered a case following an internal inquiry into a November 2023 police operation carried out in Mizoram. The case was registered after an inquiry concluded that there was prima facie material suggesting procedural and jurisdictional irregularities during the operation.
According to the FIR, the case has been filed under Sections 166, 341, 342, and 409 of the Indian Penal Code to allow a formal criminal investigation into the conduct of officers involved against IPS Shankar Choudhary, a 2011 batch officer, along with others.
The inquiry examined a cross-state police action conducted between November 21 and 30 in 2023 by a Delhi Police team in Mizoram in connection with a narcotics investigation. The FIR records that the team stayed and conducted operations outside Delhi’s territorial jurisdiction and that questions were later raised by Mizoram authorities about authorisation and custody procedures.
The document talks about an unauthorised stay and operations without lawful written orders from a competent authority.
The inquiry reviewed CCTV footage, travel records, PCR logs, and witness accounts to reconstruct the events.
According to the FIR, the vigilance inquiry found sufficient preliminary material to justify criminal registration, so the matter could be independently investigated.
“These observations constitute prima facie material for registration of a case to enable fair and independent investigation," the report states. “The purpose of the present registration is to enable a fair and independent investigation into the circumstances of the operation."
The FIR names IPS officer Shankar Choudhary as part of the raiding team whose conduct is under review.
The document records, “Shankar Choudhary IPS… was part of the raiding team which stayed and conducted operations in Mizoram during the period under inquiry."
On authorisation, the inquiry notes, “The officer stayed in Mizoram and continued operational activity without obtaining written permission from the competent authority."
The report also raises concerns over detention procedures: “Illegal detention… demonstrates that Harrison House premises were taken under control and individuals were confined without lawful authority."
Investigators further recorded, “No proper documentation of seizure, custody or inter-state coordination was found at the time of inquiry."
According to the FIR, the Delhi Police officials only provided assistance in conducting the raid under the bona fide impression that the Mizoram Police team, led by a senior police officer who earlier served as DCP/Dwarka, was carrying out the investigation legally.
“The onus was on Mizoram Police to comply with the procedural safeguard, prepare all necessary documentation related to search, seizure and arrest/detention including case diaries," the FIR says.
It further states that the role of Delhi Police officials was limited to making an entry whenever the staff moved with Mizoram Police and a detainee was brought to the police station or Anti-Narcotic Squad of Dwarka/South West.
“Upon holistic examination of the facts, evidence, and testimonies, the following findings emerge: Shankar Choudhary, IPS, acted beyond his legal and territorial authority. He conducted unauthorised raids and seizures within Delhi, violating legal and administrative protocols. He kept a suspect, Harrison, in illegal custody for four days at Mizoram House. He failed to document seized property, thereby violating legal, procedural and evidentiary norms. Delhi Police Officials (HC Shalju, HC Vikash, HC Prashant) accompanied the officer and participated in raids without requisite sanction. Their actions, while irregular, do not establish mens rea or criminal culpability but warrant departmental action," the report says.
Recommendations were made to book Shankar Choudhary for abusing authority, wrongful confinement, and misappropriation of seized property.

--------------------
External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Friday told the Parliament that the Indian government is closely monitoring the ongoing situation in Iran after a wave of protests triggered by economic stagnation, and its embassy in Tehran was in regular touch with Indian nationals.
“The Government is closely monitoring the situation in Iran. The Embassy of India in Tehran is in regular contact with Indian nationals, including students, in Iran, and is providing them regular advice," he said in the Parliament. “The Embassy continues to assist, advise, and guide Indian citizens as required."
“The Government does not currently view Indian nationals in Iran as stranded, given that Iranian airspace remains open and there is regular air connectivity between Iran and India and with the countries in the region. A special evacuation has therefore not been arranged by the Government so far. The Government continues to assess the situation as circumstances evolve," he also said.
He also informed the House that there were 9,000-10,000 Indian nationals across 16 provinces in Iran, mainly students (and their families), workers, pilgrims, tourists, business persons and seafarers. “Since Iranian airspace remains open as on date, Indian nationals wishing to leave Iran have been advised to do so using available means, including commercial flights," he said.
He also highlighted a telephonic conversation with his Iranian counterpart Abbas Araghchi, where they discussed the evolving situation in and around Iran. He also reaffirmed that India remains in touch with various interlocutors regarding the situation.
This came against the backdrop of the Iranian authorities’ deadly response to anti-government protests that began in late December and continued through last month, in which thousands of people were killed and tens of thousands arrested, prompting military threats from US President Donald Trump.

Recently, in the Budget 2026 unveiled on February 1, India earmarked zero funds for the Chabahar port in Iran despite the landmark 10-year agreement signed in 2024 for India to operate the Shahid Beheshti terminal. Analysts suggest this withdrawal is a precautionary response to the renewed geopolitical friction involving the United States.
Furthermore, Trump has also asserted that India will buy Venezuelan oil instead of Iranian crude, signalling a possible shift in global energy trade flows. However, India said it will prioritise its own energy needs and remains open to all crude deals.

--------------------
In a major institutional reform aimed at transforming urban mobility in the national capital, the Delhi government has initiated the process of drafting a comprehensive Bill for the creation of the Delhi Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (DUMTA) along with a dedicated Delhi Urban Transport Fund (DUTF).
The proposed legislation seeks to rationalise, integrate and coordinate Delhi’s presently fragmented transport ecosystem under a single, coherent planning and governance framework.
The move marks a significant milestone in the government’s vision to create a modern, efficient, people-centric and environmentally sustainable transport system for the Capital.
To fast-track and ensure inclusive drafting of the proposed law, the Chief Minister has set up a high-level task force chaired by the Chief Secretary to prepare and submit the draft Bill at the earliest. The move reflects the government’s urgency and responds to long-standing demands from experts and civic stakeholders for a unified transport authority to coordinate planning, investment and operations, a press statement said.
Recognising that Delhi’s rapid urbanisation, rising population and mounting vehicular pressure demands systemic solutions rather than piecemeal interventions, the Chief Minister has taken a proactive step by setting the legislative process in motion.
The task force includes senior officials from key departments and representatives of major civic and transport bodies such as DDA, MCD, DMRC, DTC, NCRTC and Indian Railways. The Chief Minister has also proposed co-opting leading urban transport experts to integrate global best practices with local needs.
Explaining the rationale behind the initiative, Chief Minister Rekha Gupta noted that Delhi’s transport agencies have historically functioned in silos, with limited coordination in route planning, infrastructure development and service delivery.
“DUMTA will bring cohesion to Delhi’s entire urban mobility system. By placing all modes of transport like metro, buses, regional rail, railways and feeder services, within a single planning jurisdiction, we will ensure that mobility solutions are integrated, efficient and citizen-focused," the CM said.

India is moving to formally define ‘biological drugs’ under its medicines law, as the category expands with the launch of some of the world’s top-selling therapies, including anti-obesity and diabetes blockbuster semaglutide, News18 learnt.
The move comes as drug regulators grapple with fast-evolving manufacturing technologies that blur the lines between synthetic medicines and biologically derived products, often produced within the same facility. The Drugs Technical Advisory Board (DTAB) is now set to deliberate on a proposal that seeks to introduce a legal definition of biological products, mandate origin-based labelling, and update legacy schedules under the Drugs Rules, 1945, to reflect modern biologics.
The matter has now been formally placed before the apex drug approval panel, Drugs Technical Advisory Board, with the agenda document concluding that “DTAB may kindly deliberate and give its recommendation in the matter."
If approved, industry experts believe the changes would mark a significant overhaul of India’s biological drug regulation, bringing long-overdue legal clarity at a time when biologics and peptide-based therapies are rapidly reshaping the pharmaceutical landscape. The move is also significant considering India itself is planning to become hub of biological and biosimilar drug making with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announcing the “BioShakti Pharma Hub" scheme in the union budget last Sunday.
According to the agenda document accessed by News18, the proposal has been triggered by a growing number of applications received by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation, where manufacturers are seeking regulatory approval to produce both synthetic and recombinant products at the same site. The document said that “CDSCO receives multiple applications wherein manufacturers seek permission to manufacture synthetic and r-DNA origin drug products in the same manufacturing facility."
Regulatory agency in the document noted that this convergence has become especially prominent in peptide-based therapies. “Certain peptide-based therapeutic products, such as Semaglutide and similar products are available in both synthetic and r-DNA origin and in injectable as well as oral dosage forms," the agenda paper says, underlining the regulatory complexity such products pose.
While the existing framework allows limited flexibility, the regulator acknowledges that the rules lack clarity on core definitions. “Schedule M of the Drugs Rules, 1945 provides provision for campaign-based manufacturing with appropriate cleaning validation and risk mitigation measures," the document said but adds that “the substantive provisions of the Drugs Rules do not define ‘Biological drugs’."
The absence of a formal definition has also created uncertainty around licensing, particularly when different categories of drugs are produced at the same location. The agenda paper flags that “currently, there are no provisions on licensing overlap between facilities licensed under Form 28 and Form 28D at the same site," raising concerns about regulatory oversight, inspections and compliance.
To address these gaps, the proposal recommends incorporating a definition of “biological products" into both the Drugs Rules and the New Drugs and Clinical Trials (NDCT) Rules, 2019. Citing global standards, it reproduces the World Health Organization’s definition, describing biological products as “a product containing a substance produced by or extracted from biological sources, such as living cells or organisms, and which require complex manufacturing processes and control."
The document further clarifies that “biological products include vaccines, blood and blood components, allergenic, somatic cells gene therapies, tissues, recombinant therapeutic proteins and monoclonal antibodies."
In a move aimed at improving transparency, the regulator has also proposed mandatory origin-based labelling. The agenda note states that “mandatory labelling provisions may be introduced to clearly indicate the origin of the drug as ‘Synthetic Origin,’ ‘r-DNA Origin,’ ‘Human Origin,’ or ‘Animal Origin,’ as applicable."
Additionally, the proposal calls for “consequential amendments" to Schedule C and Schedule C1 of the Drugs Rules, 1945, to explicitly include biological-origin products in both parenteral and non-parenteral forms, reflecting the growing diversity of modern biological therapies.

TITLE: NIA Raids Government Medical College Anantnag Linked To 'White Collar' Terror Module
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/nia-raids-government-medical-college-anantnag-linked-to-white-collar-terror-module-ws-l-9884205.html
--------------------
The National Investigation Agency (NIA) conducted a search operation at the Government Medical College in Anantnag district of Jammu and Kashmir on Friday. This was in connection with the “white collar" terror module that was dismantled in November last year.
According to officials, the NIA team arrived at GMC Anantnag to carry out the searches related to the recovery of a rifle found in a doctor’s locker in November of the previous year. Dr. Adeel Ahmad Rather was one of the nine individuals arrested during the investigation into the terror module, which also led to the discovery of a significant amount of explosives in Faridabad, NCR.
In a parallel development, security forces continued their search operations in the Koil Karewa area of Pulwama district. Officials stated that the operation was initiated following intelligence reports about the presence of terrorists in the region. No arrests or significant recoveries have been made so far in this ongoing operation.
One Terrorist Killed In J-K’s Kishtwar
Earlier this week, a suspected Pakistani terrorist was killed in an operation in the snow-bound higher reaches of Jammu and Kashmir’s Kishtwar district. The operation took place on Wednesday.
“In the continuing search and elimination of terrorists in the Kishtwar region, where the hunt has already led to several contacts in the dense forests and challenging terrain, a contact was re-established with the terrorists on the run in the ongoing joint operation (Trashi-I), by the troops of Counter-Insurgency Force Delta, White Knight Corps, J&K Police and CRPF at around 5:45 pm today in the general area of Dichhar, Kishtwar. One terrorist has been successfully neutralised. Operation is in progress," Army’s White Knight Corps said in a post on X.

TITLE: 'Ego-Driven Killing': How Overseas Gangsters Orchestrated AAP Leader's ‘Remote Control’ Murder
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/ego-driven-killing-how-overseas-gangsters-orchestrated-aap-leaders-remote-control-murder-ws-l-9884114.html
--------------------
The killing of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Lucky Oberoi has once again exposed the growing challenge posed by overseas-based criminal networks directing violence in Punjab from thousands of kilometres away. CCTV visuals showed a hooded assailant shooting Oberoi at close range before fleeing the scene on a scooter, pointing to a well-planned execution rather than a spontaneous act.
Top intelligence sources have told CNN-News18 that the murder was allegedly orchestrated by Jograj Singh, also known as Joga Pholriwal — a known gangster originally from the Jalandhar–Phulriwal belt — who is currently believed to be operating from either the United States or Canada. According to security agencies, the killing did not stem from a deep political conspiracy but was triggered by pride, online provocation, and the unchecked influence of criminals operating from abroad.
Intelligence sources allege that a minor altercation between Oberoi and Jograj Singh escalated over social media in the days leading up to the murder. Investigators claim the online exchanges were not random and played a direct role in provoking the attack. “This was a classic case of ego-driven violence amplified through digital platforms," a source claimed.
Sources further revealed that Jograj Singh began his criminal journey as a small-time offender involved in intimidation, assault, and extortion-related activities in Punjab. Mounting pressure from law enforcement eventually forced him to flee the country. Once abroad, distance provided him a degree of immunity, allowing him to operate with greater confidence and reduced fear of immediate arrest.
Security agencies have described the killing as a “remote control murder" — an emerging pattern in Punjab’s crime landscape. According to Punjab Police and central intelligence agencies, overseas handlers no longer pull the trigger themselves. Instead, they use encrypted messaging apps, social media provocations, and digital payments to recruit and motivate local foot soldiers to carry out violent acts.
Jograj Singh is also said to be associated with Sonu Khatri, another gangster based overseas. Intelligence sources suggest that Khatri functions less as a street-level criminal and more as a network facilitator. Agencies believe his role includes connecting overseas gangsters with local shooters, arranging logistics, and routing money through informal channels to finance murders.
The Oberoi killing, intelligence sources warn, underscores a dangerous trend where digital reach and transnational criminal networks are turning minor disputes into deadly outcomes, posing a growing challenge for Indian law enforcement agencies.

--------------------
The Karnataka government on Thursday gave its approval to use ballot papers and ballot boxes for upcoming panchayat elections. The decision clears the way for changes in the law ahead of the Panchayat polls.
Speaking about the same, State Minister HK Patil said that the approved Karnataka Gram Swaraj and Panchayat Raj (Amendment) Bill, 2026, will allow elections to be conducted using traditional voting methods instead of electronic machines.
Patil stated that the existing law does not contain provisions for ballot papers and boxes, and necessary legal changes will now be made wherever required. He confirmed that the forthcoming Panchayat elections will be conducted through this method.
The state government has expressed concerns about the use of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs). It believes public confidence in the machines has declined, prompting the shift to paper ballots.
Last September, the Congress government had already decided to recommend to the State Election Commission that future panchayat and urban local body elections be held through ballot papers rather than EVMs, citing questions raised by people over their credibility.

--------------------
Amid the ongoing woes of Delhi air pollution, the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), a prime construction and maintenance agency of the central government, has procured 405 air purifiers between 2021 and 2025.
As per the official data, the highest number of air purifiers — 156 units — were purchased during the last financial year (2024-25), the Lok Sabha was informed on Thursday.
The data was provided in response to a question asked by TMC MP Mahua Moitra. Union Minister of State for Housing and Urban Affairs Tokhan Sahu informed that the air purifiers were issued to government offices, chambers, VVIP lounges and dining halls of judges and registrars of the Supreme Court of India.
Detailing the use of the device, it was mentioned that the air purifiers were also installed in courtrooms and offices associated with the apex court.
Besides this, the air purifiers were also provided to the offices of ministers, ministries at Nirman Bhawan, Sewa Bhawan, Vigyan Bhawan and key institutional locations such as the Constitution Club of India.
Air purifiers were also issued to the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha secretariats, besides CPWD offices in Jodhpur and Varanasi.
In the written reply, it is clearly mentioned that in 2021-22, the CPWD purchased 24 air purifiers, which rose to 81 units in 2022-23. The numbers then grew in 2023-24 with the procurement of 144 air purifiers, followed by the highest purchase in 2024-25 in the last five years.
The reply included the details of the purchases made through the government’s online procurement portal, which showed air purifiers of Eureka Forbes, Honeywell, Phillips, Dyson and other brands being bought over the four years.
Apart from major construction projects, the CPWD, which comes under the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry, also looks after the maintenance of central government buildings.

--------------------
A motorcyclist was found dead inside a massive pit at a road construction site in West Delhi’s Janakpuri area on Friday morning, triggering allegations of negligence from his family. The deceased was identified as Kamal, a resident of Kailashpuri.
The Delhi government later ordered a probe into the case, Urban Development Minister Ashish Sood confirmed.
Water Minister Parvesh Verma has announced an ex gratia of Rs 10 lakh for the family of the deceased. The Delhi Jal Board has also set up a committee to probe the death of the motorcyclist who allegedly fell into a construction pit dug by the water agency.
According to the relatives of the man, he was returning home late on Thursday from his office in the Rohini area and had remained in touch with family members during the commute.
When he failed to reach home, they began searching for him, visiting several police stations through the night, including those in Janakpuri, Sagarpur, Vikas Puri and Rohini.
Family members said they received a call from the police around 7.30 am informing them about an accident.
When they reached the site, they found Kamal’s body inside the pit along with his motorcycle.

They alleged negligence by the Delhi Jal Board, which was carrying out construction work at the location, and also raised the possibility of foul play, claiming someone might have killed Kamal and dumped his body in the manhole.
Police said all angles were being examined.
Responding to the incident, Delhi Jal Board has expressed “deep sorrow" over the tragic accident that occurred at the pipeline rehabilitation project site in Janakpuri and conveyed its condolences to the bereaved family.
A serious view has been taken of the tragic accident at the Janakpuri Line Rehabilitation Project site.Delhi Jal Board has constituted a high-level Inquiry Committee to ensure a transparent investigation into the incident.

The Board said a committee has been constituted to investigate the incident, and assured that strict action will be taken if negligence is found at any level. It added that regular inspections of safety measures are being carried out at all workplaces. The board has urged citizens to report any unsafe worksite on the toll-free helpline number 1916.
According to news agency PTI, authorities received a call around 7 am about the incident in Janakpuri, following which personnel rushed to the spot.
A senior officer told the agency that preliminary investigations indicated the pit was part of a Delhi Jal Board worksite and that it had been “properly barricaded."
“We are investigating the matter to ascertain the exact sequence of events," the officer was quoted as saying.
DELHI MAN FALLS TO DEATH IN PIT: THE POLICE’S VERSION
According to the Delhi Police, the man worked at the HDFC Bank, and his daily shift usually ended at nearly 11 pm.
On Thursday, as his shift ended, he called his family and informed them that he was at Janakpuri District Centre and was on his way home.
As the police were informed about the family, at nearly 12.30 am, that Kamal had not reached home, a search for him began. Subsequently, the police traced his mobile phone’s location, which was nearly 200 mts away from the accident spot.
The Delhi Police conducted a search operation in the area for nearly two hours during the night, with head constables searching the surroundings for any clues.
Kamal’s body was found in the morning when someone reported that a man and a bike were lying in a pit.
Police reached the spot, and a team from the fire brigade was called.
The body was fished out at nearly 8.30 am.
AAP BLAMES BJP
Saurabh Bharadwaj, Delhi unit chief of the Aam Aadmi Party, shared the pictures of the accident on his official X handle.
In his post, Bharadwaj wrote, “Shocking !!! An innocent biker fell into a deep pothole on the road, got stuck, lay there all night, and died."
“The BJP government in Delhi has learned nothing from the Noida incident. They just keep lying every day," he alleged.
The incident comes weeks after a similar case in Noida, where 27-year-old software engineer Yuvraj Mehta died after his car fell into a waterlogged pit near a construction site.
The incident had happened in Sector 150 area during the intervening night of January 16 and 17.
In the recent case, authorities in Delhi said forensic teams and local officers were reconstructing the sequence of events in Kamal’s case, examining whether safety barricades were intact, checking nearby CCTV footage and recording statements from witnesses and family members.
Officials stressed that no conclusion would be drawn until the probe is completed.

TITLE: A Farmer, A Megaphone And His Radish Harvest Outside A Govt Office In Karnataka

--------------------
On a recent morning in Tumakuru district, visitors to the Madhugiri taluk office were met with an unusual sight. A farmer stood outside the building with a megaphone, speaking calmly but firmly about a problem that, he said, had gone unresolved for months.
Beside him was a scooter loaded not with files or placards, but with freshly harvested radish.
The farmer, Prasanna Kumar from Dodderi Jakkenahalli village, said he has been seeking a proper connecting road to his agricultural land. According to him, the absence of a motorable access road has made it difficult to transport produce and carry out routine farming work.
Prasanna told officials and onlookers that he had repeatedly approached the local administration for help. Over time, the issue moved beyond the village level and reached higher authorities.
Orders Issued, But No Action on Ground
According to Prasanna, the matter was taken up with the Lokayukta, which directed officials to resolve the issue within a month. He also said he approached senior political leaders, including the chief minister and the revenue minister, following which letters were issued asking the local administration to act.
Despite these directions, Prasanna claimed no work had begun even after nearly two months. The lack of progress, he said, pushed him to stage a public protest.
Allegation of Bribe Demand
Standing outside the taluk office, Prasanna alleged that officials linked to the village administration and revenue department demanded money to move the file forward. He accused the village accountant and panchayat-level revenue inspectors of seeking a bribe.
“I don’t have cash to pay," he said through the megaphone, explaining why he chose to bring radish from his field. His message was symbolic: if money was the obstacle, he was willing to offer what he had grown instead.
The Radish Protest Goes Viral
Videos and photographs of the farmer’s protest, radish stacked on a scooter and slogans amplified through a megaphone quickly spread on social media. The visuals drew widespread attention, with many users interpreting the protest as a reflection of frustration with bureaucratic delays and alleged corruption.
Following the online attention, senior officials responded. Gotur Shivappa, assistant commissioner of Madhugiri, said he had instructed the tahsildar to look into the farmer’s complaint on priority.
Officials Deny Bribery Allegations
Revenue officials, however, rejected the farmer’s claims. Srinivas, the current tahsildar of Madhugiri, said the issue was not administrative delay but a family dispute.
According to him, a previous tahsildar had already arranged for an eight-foot-wide road, and an existing asphalted road already provided access to the land. Officials also said they had visited the village and that the remaining disagreement involved relatives and an adjacent plot.
While the farmer maintains that official inaction and alleged bribe demands forced him to protest publicly, authorities insist the road issue has largely been addressed and that the conflict is personal rather than procedural.
With the matter now under scrutiny and senior officials involved, attention has shifted to what action follows and whether the farmer’s access road will finally move from paper to ground.

TITLE: 'People Rejected You': SC Rejects Prashant Kishor-Led Party's Plea Challenging Bihar Elections
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/people-rejected-you-sc-rejects-prashant-kishor-led-partys-plea-challenging-bihar-elections-9883643.html
--------------------
The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed a petition filed by Jan Suraaj, the political party led by poll strategist-turned-politician Prashant Kishor, challenging the outcome of the Bihar Assembly elections held in November last year.
Refusing to entertain the plea, a bench headed by Chief Justice Surya Kant made sharp remarks on the party’s electoral defeat, saying, “The people rejected you and now you are using this judicial platform to gain publicity?"
Justice Joymalya Bagchi also questioned the maintainability of the petition, asking Jan Suraaj’s counsel how such claims could be raised directly before the apex court.
The bench declined to hear the matter under Article 32 and asked the petitioner to approach the Bihar High Court instead.
Jan Suraaj had sought to have the election results declared null and void, alleging large-scale violations of the Model Code of Conduct by the ruling Janata Dal (United)–Bharatiya Janata Party alliance.
The party argued that the state government’s decision to disburse Rs 10,000 to one woman per family during the election period compromised the fairness of the polls.
According to the petition, the benefit was extended to an estimated 25–35 lakh women voters while the Model Code was in force, amounting to “corrupt practices" by the ruling coalition.
Kishor had earlier claimed that the JD(U) distributed crores of rupees per constituency and said the party should not have won more than 25 seats under normal circumstances.
In the election, however, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) emerged as the largest party, winning 85 seats, far exceeding both its 2015 tally and Kishor’s own predictions.
The Supreme Court noted that the broader issue of election freebies is already under its consideration in a separate case.
In earlier observations, the court had warned that competitive promises of financial benefits could push states towards fiscal distress and has referred the issue to a three-judge bench.
On Friday, the court said it was serious about examining the matter but would prefer petitions from “public-spirited" individuals rather than parties that had suffered a complete electoral defeat.
Jan Suraaj’s challenge follows a disappointing electoral debut for the party, which contested 238 seats but failed to win a single constituency, ending with a vote share of under four per cent.
Kishor, who had previously engineered successful campaigns for both the BJP and JD(U), had predicted a decisive outcome for his party, either a major breakthrough or total failure.

--------------------
The Madras High Court on Friday dismissed a petition filed by actor and Tamilaga Vetri Kazhagam (TVK) founder Vijay, who had challenged a Rs 1.5 crore penalty imposed by the Income Tax Department.
Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorty rejected the plea and upheld the demand notice issued by the department. The penalty relates to the assessment year 2015–16 and concerns alleged non-disclosure of income.
According to the tax authorities, documents seized during a 2015 search at Vijay’s residence indicated that he had not declared Rs 15 crore earned from the film Puli. Based on these findings, the department issued an order on June 30, 2022 imposing the penalty.
Vijay, however, maintained that he had declared an income of Rs 35.42 crore for the financial year 2016–17 and challenged the department’s action in court.
A single judge had earlier admitted his petition on August 16, 2022 and granted interim relief by staying the operation of the penalty order.
With Friday’s ruling, the High Court has now dismissed his challenge and allowed the tax department’s action to stand.
Vijay argued that the penalty order ought to have been issued before June 30, 2019 and claimed that the delay made it invalid. The Income Tax Department, however, maintained that the action was lawful under the provisions of the Income Tax Act and urged the court to reject his petition.
After considering both sides, the court agreed with the department’s stand and dismissed Vijay’s plea.

Parliament Budget Session Highlights: The Lok Sabha has been adjourned after witnessing a ruckus by the Opposition leaders on Friday. The MPs of the opposition walked out of the lower house and staged a protest against the government over the India-US trade deal.
Earlier on Thursday, the Lok Sabha was adjourned amid the ruckus by the opposition.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke on the Motion of Thanks on the President’s address in the Rajya Sabha. He also attacked Congress leader and Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi over a controversial “traitor” remark made against BJP MP Ravneet Singh Bittu, calling it an insult to the Sikh community and a reflection of Congress’ “arrogance at its peak.
“What happened yesterday — the ‘Yuvraj’ of Congress, who has a ‘shaatir dimaag’ called a member of this House a traitor. His arrogance is at its peak. He did not call others who left Congress traitors, but he said it to this MP because he is a Sikh. This is an insult to Sikhs, an insult to the Gurus. This shows the hatred Congress carries,” PM Modi said.

Raj Sabha proceedings began at 2 AM.
BJP MP PP Chaudhary criticised the Congress over disruptions during the ongoing session, saying the party lacked facts and ideology. He urged the Opposition to adopt a constructive role in Parliament instead of what he called a destructive approach.
“The way the Congress disrupted the House in this session, they have no facts and ideology… The Congress should take a constructive approach, but it has a destructive one,” he said.
Rajya Sabha has been adjourned till 2 PM.
Opposition MPs are holding protest against the government at the Makar Dwar of the Parliament.

Lok Sabha proceedings continued with sloganeering by the Opposition.
A ruckus began in Lok Sabha again after the proceedings began at 12 PM.
Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi criticised personal remarks made against former Prime Ministers, calling them “reprehensible”. She said those aligned with the BJP and RSS ideology should also acknowledge the contributions of past Prime Ministers.
Lok Sabha proceedings adjourned till 12 PM amid ruckus by Opposition.

From 3:30 pm, the Lok Sabha will take up Private Members’ Business, during which several Bills are set to be introduced. These include proposals for constitutional changes, electoral law amendments, and welfare measures for farmers, fishermen, students, senior citizens, women and workers, along with legislation related to education, healthcare, environment, artificial intelligence, digital platforms, labour reforms and social security.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi criticised Congress leader and Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi in Rajya Sabha on Thursday over his alleged “traitor” remark against BJP MP Ravneet Singh Bittu, calling it an insult to the Sikh community and a sign of Congress’ “arrogance at its peak”.
The Lok Sabha will start the general discussion on the Union Budget at 11 AM, beginning with Question Hour. The House is also scheduled to take up Private Members’ Business later in the afternoon, where several proposed laws — including constitutional changes, electoral reforms and welfare measures — are expected to be introduced.

TITLE: Delhi To Launch Double-Decker Tourist Buses For Key Heritage Sites Soon | Check Routes And Fares
LINK: https://www.news18.com/cities/new-delhi-news/delhi-to-launch-double-decker-tourist-buses-for-key-heritage-sites-soon-check-routes-and-fares-ws-l-9883094.html
--------------------
The national capital is gearing up to introduce a new sightseeing experience for visitors with the launch of double-decker tourist buses later this month. The initiative, led by the Delhi government, will link major heritage and cultural landmarks through a specially designed tourism circuit across the heart of the city.
Senior officials said the service, likely to start in February, is being developed primarily for domestic and foreign tourists, with a strong focus on the central vista and nearby national monuments. The aim is to make some of Delhi’s most prominent attractions easier to access through a single, organised route.
Major Heritage Sites To Be Linked Via This Service
The planned circuit will include destinations such as the Pradhanmantri Sangrahalaya, National War Memorial, Bharat Mandapam, the new Parliament complex, Kartavya Path and Dilli Haat. Officials said the project seeks to present these landmarks as part of a unified tourism experience rather than isolated sites.
The use of double-decker buses is expected to enhance sightseeing, with elevated seating offering wider views of monuments and ceremonial avenues. Authorities believe this format will provide a more engaging and relaxed way for visitors to explore the city.
In addition to daytime operations, the tourism department is also working on evening sightseeing services. While the night-tour route has largely been finalised, details on operating hours are yet to be announced.
An electric double-decker bus, along with two other buses, is expected to begin service around February 20, coinciding with the first anniversary of the Delhi government. The electric vehicle has been supplied by a private firm under a corporate social responsibility initiative. Originally housed at the Okhla depot under the transport department, the bus has now been transferred to the tourism department.
Check Fares
According to officials, the service will operate from the Pradhanmantri Sangrahalaya and cover several major landmarks along the route. The fare has been fixed at Rs 500 for adults and Rs 300 for children aged between six and twelve years, news agency PTI reported.
A guide will be on board to brief passengers about the historical and cultural significance of each location. Information on booking procedures and schedules will be released ahead of the official launch.
Double-decker buses were once a familiar sight on Delhi’s roads, run by the Delhi Transport Corporation under the name “Suvidha", before they were discontinued in 1989 following the gradual withdrawal of the ageing fleet.

TITLE: Roads, Mining, Hydel Projects Claimed Nearly 1 Lakh Hectares Of India's Forest Land Since 2020
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/roads-mining-hydel-projects-claimed-nearly-1-lakh-hectares-of-indias-forest-land-since-2020-9882951.html
--------------------
Nearly 97,050 hectares of forest land was diverted for non-forestry purposes in the last five financial years, starting 2020-21, the Union Environment Ministry told Parliament. Madhya Pradesh accounted for the largest share, with 902 such proposals for non-forestry use approved and only six rejected between 1st April 2020 and 31st March 2025.
The government said that it gave the go-ahead to as many as 10,026 proposals during this period and rejected just 120 proposals—an overwhelmingly high approval rate, with only a handful of rejections. Some regions, like the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, where 26 projects were approved, saw no rejection. Jammu and Kashmir, as well as Manipur, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram in the Northeast, also saw no rejections.
Out of the total projects considered during the last five years, most of them were approved in Gujarat (1560), with Haryana (1424) and Uttar Pradesh (1188) following closely behind.
Roads cut the deepest into India’s forests, with nearly 22,233 hectares of forest land diverted for construction of roads alone. Mining and quarrying followed close behind, claiming 18,913 hectares of forest land, while hydel and irrigation projects claimed 17,434 hectares, and power transmission lines nearly 13,859 hectares. Remaining diversions were mostly for Defence (6,041 hectares), railways (5,957 hectares), and other developmental projects.
Responding to questions, Minister of State (Environment, Forests, and Climate Change) Kirti Vardhan Singh said the diversion was approved under the Van (Sanrakshan Evam Samvardhan) Adhiniyam, 1980. “The central government, following the prescribed statutory approval process, takes prompt decisions on proposals for diversion of forest land, including all development projects, that are complete in all respects," he told Parliament.
As per the conditions of approval, the states/UTs concerned have to ensure that a minimum number of trees are felled, and wherever feasible, translocation of trees is to be done, and the permission for felling of trees is given by the concerned states/UTs, he added.
While Madhya Pradesh recorded the maximum diversion of forest land—24,346 hectares—it was followed by Odisha (12,875 hectares), Gujarat (6,850), and Arunachal Pradesh (6,656 hectares), as per the data from 2020-21 to 2024-25.
The government attributed the reduction in timelines observed in the processing of Environmental Clearance (EC) proposals to “comprehensive regulatory reforms undertaken by the Environment Ministry, supported by technology-driven interventions such as GIS layers, Decision Support System". The minister also cited the recently launched online single-window system for processing such proposals, as well as amendments to the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006, and office memorandums issued from time to time for reducing the duration.
The government had also recently given appraisal powers to the State Environment Impact Assessment Authorities (SEIAAs) for sectors like mining, irrigation, and power projects, and also increased Expert Appraisal Committee meetings to at least twice a month to speed up proposal review.
Under the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006, project proposals are examined by an Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC), which reviews their environmental impacts. The committee recommendations are then placed before the ministry, which takes the final decision on granting or rejecting environmental clearance. Forest diversion proposals from states are reviewed by an advisory committee under the Van (Sanrakshan Evam Samvardhan Adhiniyam), 1980.

--------------------
The Government of India, the Government of Nagaland and representatives of the Eastern Nagaland Peoples’ Organisation (ENPO) on Wednesday signed a historic agreement in New Delhi.
The pact paves the way for the creation of the Frontier Nagaland Territorial Authority (FNTA) for six eastern districts of Nagaland that include Tuensang, Mon, Kiphire, Longleng, Noklak and Shamator and provides for the devolution of powers over 46 subjects to the new authority.
The agreement was signed in the presence of Union Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation Amit Shah and Nagaland Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio.
Calling the day “a very significant moment" for a dispute-free Northeast, Shah said the Modi government is committed to resolving every long-pending issue through dialogue and democratic means. He noted that since 2019, the Centre has signed 12 major agreements in the region, stressing that, unlike earlier governments, the current administration ensures their implementation “in letter and spirit."
Shah assured ENPO representatives that the Centre would actively support the development of Eastern Nagaland and shoulder its responsibilities. A fixed amount will be allocated annually for the region’s development, while the Union Ministry of Home Affairs will bear the initial expenditure for setting up the FNTA.
The Home Minister said people of Eastern Nagaland had long felt deprived since the state’s formation and acknowledged the region’s strategic importance. He credited sustained efforts by the Ministry of Home Affairs for bridging differences between the ENPO and the Nagaland government, leading to the resolution of the dispute.
Expressing gratitude to Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio and the Nagaland cabinet, Shah said their openness and cooperation helped take negotiations to a logical conclusion. “There will now be no obstacles in the path of Eastern Nagaland’s development," he said, adding that the agreement reflects the government’s commitment to fulfilling the genuine aspirations of the people.
Under the arrangement, a mini-secretariat for the FNTA will be set up, headed by an Additional Chief Secretary or Principal Secretary. Development outlay for Eastern Nagaland will be shared in proportion to population and area. The agreement clarifies that it does not affect the provisions of Article 371(A) of the Constitution.
The pact envisages accelerated development of Eastern Nagaland through greater financial autonomy, enhanced decision-making, improved infrastructure, economic empowerment and optimal use of resources. Senior officials from the Centre and the Nagaland government, along with the Deputy Chief Minister and other dignitaries, were present at the signing ceremony.

TITLE: 'To Protect Buyers, Deliver Their Dream Homes': SC Asks NBCC To Take Over Stalled Supertech Projects
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/to-protect-buyers-deliver-their-dream-homes-sc-asks-nbcc-to-take-over-stalled-supertech-projects-ws-l-9881884.html
--------------------
The Supreme Court on Thursday intervened to bring relief to thousands of Supertech homebuyers, issuing a landmark ruling for the state-owned National Buildings Construction Corporation to take over and finish 16 stalled projects under the real estate developer.
The court said this is to protect thousands who have waited over a decade for their Supertech housing units and to finally deliver their “dream homes" to them.
By invoking its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution, the SC said the National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) must take over. A bench comprising Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi used these plenary powers to uphold a December 2024 order by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).
The court said approximately 51,000 homes had been booked between 2010 and 2012, leaving families in limbo for years. To ensure progress remains uninterrupted, the bench has prohibited other legal bodies, including all high courts and tribunals, from issuing orders that might freeze the ongoing work. This is intended to allow the NBCC to complete the debt-ridden projects expeditiously and without further judicial interference.
The apex court said judicial priority is now focused entirely on the delivery of completed homes equipped with essential utilities, rather than the immediate demands of corporate creditors. Chief Justice Surya Kant made it clear that the interests and dues of financial and operational creditors will only be addressed after the delivery of fully-furnished houses to the buyers. These must have all the assured facilities, including water, electricity, sewage connections, roads, and parks.
As a result of this prioritisation, financial lenders are expected to accept reduced payments, or a “haircut", to facilitate the recovery process. The bench described these reduced payments as “just and equitable" and ruled that the NBCC’s takeover is not contrary to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).
“We find that the order passed by the NCLAT on December 12, 2024, in bringing the NBCC on record for the completion of the pending housing projects is neither unfair nor contrary to the provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC)," the bench ordered while taking recourse of Article 142, which grants the top court plenary power to pass any decree or order necessary for doing “complete justice" in any case.
The NBCC will now undertake the projects – previously estimated to cost approximately Rs 9,500 crore – with the support of an expert committee. While disposing of the pleas, the bench noted that parties may still approach the court should any new developments obstruct the ongoing construction.
On February 21, 2025, the court had stayed an order appointing the NBCC as the project management consultant to complete the 16 housing projects of Supertech at a cost of nearly Rs 9,500 crore.

TITLE: Poll Body's Big Attack On TMC Govt, Cites 'Systematic Pattern Of Violence' Against Officials
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/ecis-big-attack-on-tmc-govt-claims-systematic-pattern-of-violence-against-poll-officials-ws-kl-9882552.html
--------------------
The Election Commission of India (ECI) has accused the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government in West Bengal of “systematic pattern of violence and threats" against election officials, while also alleging police of unwillingness to act against such incidents.
After West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee appeared in the Supreme Court and spoke against the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, the poll body filed a counter in the apex court, alleging numerous instances of violence, intimidation and obstruction against election officials engaged in the SIR process.
Sujeet Kumar Mishra, Secretary, ECI, alleged a “pervasive reluctance" among local police authorities to register FIRs in response to grievances articulated by BLOs, and many of them were only filed after the direct intervention of the DEO (District Election Officer). While other states promptly adhered to ECI directives regarding SIR, West Bengal willfully neglected to do so.
Bengal CEO’s Office Gheraoed
In its response, the ECI claimed that protesters claiming to be BLOs attempted forceful entry into the office of Bengal’s Chief Electoral Officer (CEO), broke the police blockade and vandalised the office. It said officers were prevented from entering and leaving the office complex as the office was also gheraoed, resulting in significant impediments to the execution of duties by officers.
The ECI said it directed the Kolkata Police Commissioner to ensure that no untoward incident occurs again. Despite explicit directives to the police, the protesters were not removed and remained in the office premises for 28 hours. It further said that the CEO was the sole electoral official in the country who had been accorded ‘Y+’ category security.
It also detailed a disturbing pattern of conduct “previously unseen during electoral roll revision exercises" in Bengal, including a statement by a cabinet minister that he will “break the legs of Election Commission". The poll agency observed that groups of women, allegedly mobilised by political operatives, obstructed the activities of BLOs and EROs.
‘Provocative’ Statements Of Mamata Banerjee, Police Inaction
The Election Commission also observed that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee “persistently delivered a series of public addresses that are inherently provocative, thereby engendering an atmosphere of intimidation among the election officials tasked with the separation and revision of the electoral roll."
It also accused the CM of engaging in fear-mongering, disseminating misleading and erroneous information about the SIR process and threatening election officials, which prompted several observers to withdraw from their SIR responsibilities due to fear of violent assaults.
It also said BLOs are facing overwhelming stress due to systematic police indifference and the failure to register FIRs, interference by Booth Level Agents of political factions. A roll observer reported that women’s mob in Debipur shouting “BJP dalal" slogans, chasing team with broomsticks after the CM’s “kitchen tools" call.
The affidavit blamed “inadequacies of state machinery" and “prevailing climate of political interference" for a “singular and alarming breakdown" in West Bengal SIR. The Commission warned that political rhetoric from TMC leaders vitiates conditions for a “free, fair and fearless" revision process in West Bengal.
Mamata Banerjee has previously characterised the exercise as a vehicle for “unspeakable harassment", alleging it has resulted in “as many as 140 deaths" and violates the Representation of the People Act. In a series of letters addressed to the CEC, she has sounded an alarm on what she describes as “institutional overreach" and a “dangerous erosion of trust" in democratic processes.

LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/pm-modi-quotes-indira-gandhi-to-criticise-congress-govts-functioning-knew-shortcomings-but-ws-l-9882188.html
--------------------
Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a sharp attack on former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s development record, citing what he called systemic rigidity in India’s planning apparatus that hampered infrastructure projects for generations. Addressing Parliament during the Motion of Thanks to the President’s Address, PM Modi invoked Indira Gandhi’s own acknowledgment of the disconnect between policymakers and ground realities, using it to criticize the Planning Commission she once chaired.
“I had gone to Himachal Pradesh. When I returned, I told the Planning Commission that our workers need mules, not jeeps. But we were told that the funds are only available for jeeps; there is no policy to fund mules. They said, if there are no proper roads, then what use is a jeep," PM Modi said, quoting Indira Gandhi’s remarks.
PM Modi said this reflected “a system that knew its shortcomings but did not reform itself."
The Planning Commission, established in 1950 with Jawaharlal Nehru- Indira Gandhi’s father- as its first chairman, was responsible for drafting and implementing India’s Five-Year Plans. The Planning Commission was dissolved in 2014 under PM Modi’s government and replaced with NITI Aayog.
PM Modi highlighted the Congress party’s historical failure to deliver timely and efficient development, asserting, “A significant part of our energy is being spent on correcting the mistakes of the past. It takes great effort to erase the image that was created in the minds of the world during that period."
The Prime Minister also cited the Sardar Sarovar Dam on the Narmada River as a case study of delayed execution and policy inertia under previous administrations. The multipurpose dam’s foundation stone was laid in 1961 but it officially became operational only in 2017- more than five decades later and roughly 30 years after construction began in earnest.
The Sardar Sarovar Dam, part of the broader Narmada Valley development initiative, faced numerous obstacles over its decades-long journey. Construction was stalled in the 1990s by court orders related to rehabilitation and resettlement conditions for displaced communities. Procedural and clearance issues further bogged down progress, keeping it mired in administrative hurdles.
PM Modi contrasted the delays and inefficiencies of past governments with his administration’s emphasis on future-ready policies, strategic governance and faster project execution, arguing that India is now on a more decisive development path.
“That is why we have placed strong emphasis on future-ready policies. Today, the country is being governed on the basis of policy and strategy," PM Modi said.

--------------------
The Bihar government has announced a strict crackdown on the playing of obscene and double-meaning songs in public places and vehicles, warning of legal action, including fines and imprisonment, for violators.
Deputy Chief Minister and Home Minister Samrat Choudhary has issued firm directions to the police headquarters, instructing officers across all districts to immediately stop the playing of vulgar songs, whether in Bhojpuri, Magahi, Maithili or any other language. He has asked the police to launch special drives to identify offenders and initiate strict legal action against them.
Mr Choudhary said the decision was taken in the interest of social decency and public safety, noting that obscene songs played in public spaces have a deeply negative impact on society, particularly on children. He added that such content not only promotes vulgarity but also undermines women’s safety and dignity. Banning obscene songs, he said, is essential to creating a secure and respectful environment for women.
As part of the move, obscene songs will no longer be permitted in buses, auto-rickshaws, taxis, trains or any other public place. Following the government’s directive, Bihar Police has launched a statewide campaign along with a public appeal under the slogan “No obscene songs, build a civilised society".
The police have clarified that playing obscene or double-meaning songs in public will now be treated as a serious punishable offence. Drivers and vehicle owners found violating the order will face heavy fines and may also be sent to jail.
Under the new enforcement measures, police will register cases under Sections 296 and 79 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023, along with other applicable provisions. Citizens have been urged to oppose such acts and report violations to the nearest police station.
The state government has emphasised that public participation is crucial to eliminating obscenity from public life. Bihar Police, appealing to citizens, said a civilised and safe society can be achieved not only through strict laws but also through collective responsibility and cooperation.

--------------------
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India’s recent trade agreements with the United States and the European Union have generated a sense of economic stability and forward momentum, while creating wide-ranging opportunities for the country’s youth. Addressing the Rajya Sabha during the Motion of Thanks to the President’s Address, PM Modi described the agreements as “future‑ready" pacts that are strengthening India’s position in the global economy.
“After the trade deal with the US, there is a feeling of stability and a sense of forward movement," he said.
The Prime Minister said India is increasingly signing major trade deals with key global partners.
“In the past few days, we have signed agreements with nine significant nations. The most comprehensive of these is with a bloc of 27 countries, including the European Union," he added.
PM Modi highlighted that major economies are keen to strengthen trade ties with India. “Countries around the world are eager to expand trade relations with India. Whether it is the EU deal or the recent pact with the US, these agreements are receiving broad international praise," he said.
He also stressed the global significance of these agreements.
“When we signed the trade deal with the EU, the world became more confident about the greater likelihood of global stability. After the trade deal with the US, the world became even more confident that with stability, they can sense a speed too. This is a positive sign for the world," the Prime Minister said.
Highlighting the domestic impact, PM Modi said the agreements would directly benefit India’s youth across regions and social groups.
“The US trade deal will be most beneficial to the youth, including those from urban areas and rural, as well as for girls and boys. The demand for young professionals is growing around the world, and since so many foreign companies are setting up here, the opportunities are abundant for Indian young professionals as well," he said.
Placing India’s economic trajectory in a broader geopolitical context, the Prime Minister said the world is witnessing a major transition.
“There was a new world order after the Second World War, and now the world is moving towards a new world order. The bent is towards India, which is a vishvabandhu," he said.
Launching a sharp attack on the Congress, PM Modi said past governments had left behind a damaged global image.
“A significant part of our energy is being spent on correcting the mistakes of the past. It takes great effort to erase the image that was created in the minds of the world during that period. They left things in such a damaged state," he said.
He said this is why the NDA government has prioritised long-term policy planning.
“That is why we have placed strong emphasis on future-ready policies. Today, the country is being governed on the basis of policy and strategy," PM Modi said, taking a swipe at past controversies.
“Even now, when people speak about them, they don’t talk about trade deals. They talk about deals like Bofors," he said.
Asserting that global confidence in India is steadily rising, the Prime Minister said, “Global trust in India is growing. Guided by the mantra of ‘reform, perform, transform,’ we have moved forward, and the reality today is that the nation has boarded the Reform Express."
Describing the current decade as a defining phase for India, he added, “The first quarter of the 21st century has completed. But this second quarter is decisive, just like the second quarter of India’s freedom struggle in the last century was. I can clearly see that in the direction of building Viksit Bharat, this second quarter is going to be equally capable."

--------------------
The long-running dispute over nearly 45,000 square metres of land at Asaram’s ashram in Motera, Ahmedabad, has reached a decisive end, with the Gujarat High Court allowing the state government to reclaim the land, paving the way for the removal of illegal constructions and future development.
Following the ruling, authorities have accelerated preparations to clear unauthorised structures from the ashram complex. The land has been earmarked for expansion of the Sardar Patel Sports Enclave, a key project linked to the state’s preparations for the Commonwealth Games 2030.
According to official records, the premises contained at least 32 illegal structures, valued at around Rs 500 crore. Investigations found that these structures were not only illegal but were also being used for commercial purposes. Citing violations of building rules and encroachment on government land, the collector’s office had earlier issued notices to the ashram trust.
The trust subsequently sought to regularise the constructions by paying an “impact fee", but the request was rejected by the authorities, leading to the legal battle. Delivering the verdict, Justice Vaibhavi Nanavati ruled in favour of the state, observing that the government’s action was justified in view of serious rule violations and the larger public interest involved in development projects.
With the court’s clearance, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation is now authorised to remove the illegal structures at any time after completing security and procedural formalities. Officials said the land would be utilised for a modern sports complex, training facilities and a proposed Olympic village as part of the Sports Enclave project.
The verdict is being seen as a significant boost to Gujarat’s infrastructure plans, particularly its ambition to host the Commonwealth Games 2030. State officials have maintained that world-class sports facilities are essential for the event and that the Motera land is strategically critical to these preparations.
Asaram, who is serving a life sentence in a rape case and was recently granted conditional bail on medical grounds, visited the Surat ashram on January 2 after nearly 13 years. Videos showing followers welcoming him with music and celebrations had drawn public attention.

TITLE: 'Sahkar, Not Sarkar': Amit Shah Launches Bharat Taxi Service, Promises Big Benefits For Drivers
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/sahkar-not-sarkar-amit-shah-launches-bharat-taxi-service-promises-big-benefits-for-drivers-9881648.html
--------------------
Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday launched Bharat Taxi, a cooperative-owned platform that enables drivers to operate as owners, ensuring zero commission and eliminating surge pricing. The service aims to compete with apps like Uber and Ola.
The Cooperation Ministry described Bharat Taxi as a transformative initiative in the mobility sector, placing drivers —referred to as sarathis (charioteers) — at the centre of ownership, operations, and value creation, thereby freeing them from exploitative aggregator-based models.
Speaking at the launch event, Amit Shah said the Bharat Taxi service will provide major convenience for taxi drivers, saying that “sahkar (helper), not Sarkar (government)" is formally entering the taxi sector.
“In this system, every driver (Sarathi) is the owner of the taxi, and this structure will bring a revolutionary economic transformation. Like Amul in Gujarat, this is a unique cooperative model of its kind in the world. The wheels of your taxi will run for the benefit of the Sarathi community—this is the spirit of cooperation," he said.
Shah further revealed that Bharat Taxi was envisioned as a unified mobility platform that offered two-wheelers, three-wheelers and four-wheelers. “Bharat Taxi “Sarathi Didi" will play a key role in ensuring the safety, dignity, and empowerment of women riders and drivers," he added.
No Commissions, Lower Fares
The Home Minister said the taxi service will be rolled out in three years, and the government will charge 20% of the revenue earned by the platform, while the rest will be transferred into the accounts of each Sarathi.
“Until now, fares were first credited to the company’s account and a commission was deducted. That system ends here. Bharat Taxi will charge zero commission. Not even one percent," he added. “All payments will be transferred directly from the customer to the Sarathi’s account — no middleman, no delays."
Furthermore, the platform will also exclude booking fees, heavy platform charges, and hidden commissions from the Sarathi app, making it more convenient for drivers and travellers. All the profits earned will be directly transferred into accounts of the drivers associated with the Bharat Taxi service. However, Amit Shah also cautioned drivers to maintain professional standards and behaviour with travellers.
The event was also graced by Union Minister of State for Cooperation Krishan Pal Gurjar; Union Minister of State for Cooperation Murlidhar Mohol; Dr. Ashish Kumar Bhutani, Secretary, Ministry of Cooperation and other senior dignitaries.
The Cooperation Ministry said Amit Shah will distribute share certificates to the top six performing Sarathis, further reinforcing the core principle of ‘Sarathi Hi Malik’. Each honoured Sarathi will be provided with a personal accident insurance cover of Rs 5 lakh and a family health insurance cover of Rs 5 lakh, reflecting Bharat Taxi’s commitment to driver welfare and long-term social security.
Bharat Taxi prioritises social security for Sarathis through health insurance, accident insurance, retirement savings, and a dedicated driver support system. Support centres are being operated at seven key locations in Delhi. The platform provides rapid emergency assistance, verified ride data, and allows drivers the freedom to work on other platforms without any exclusivity clauses. To promote women’s empowerment, initiatives such as “Bike Didi" are being implemented, under which more than 150 women drivers have joined Bharat Taxi so far.

The West Bengal government has informed the Election Commission that it is ready to make available 8,505 Group B officers of the state or its instrumentalities for the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in the State, sources said.
This assumes significance as the counsel appearing for the poll panel had argued in the Supreme Court on February 4, 2026, that the West Bengal government provided the services of only 80 Grade 2 officers for overseeing the SIR exercise.
A Bench comprising Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and N.V. Anjaria is slated to hear on Monday (February 9, 2026) a batch of pleas, including the one filed by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, relating to the ongoing SIR process in the State.
Sources said that Ms. Banerjee, who on February 4 became the first serving chief minister to argue in the top court, may come to the apex court on Monday (February 9, 2026) again.
They said the West Bengal government has informed the poll panel that it is ready and willing to make available 8,505 Group B officers of the State or its instrumentalities for the SIR exercise there.
On February 4, senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, appearing for the poll panel, told the apex court that the state had provided the services of only 80 Grade 2 officers, such as SDMs, for overseeing the SIR process.
Mr. Dwivedi also said that only low-ranked government employees, such as Anganwadi workers, were provided by the West Bengal government for the exercise.
Ms. Banerjee had countered the ECI's charges and said the state had provided whatever was sought by the poll panel.
The chief minister had vehemently urged the top court to intervene in the SIR process in West Bengal to "save democracy", alleging that the State was being targeted and its people were being bulldozed.
The top court took note of Banerjee's petition against the SIR exercise and said that genuine persons must remain on the electoral rolls.
It issued notices and sought replies to the petition by February 9 from the Election Commission and the chief electoral officer of West Bengal.
The Bench also asked the poll panel to instruct booth-level officers and electoral roll officers to be more sensitive while issuing notices on grounds of minor discrepancies, such as mismatched spelling of names, etc.
On January 19, the top court passed a slew of directions, observing that the SIR process in West Bengal should be transparent and not cause any inconvenience.

The government will soon constitute a High-Level Committee on Banking for Viksit Bharat to draw up a blueprint to create mega-lenders capable of meeting the financing needs of a developed India, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said.
Credible and creditable: On Union Budget 2026-27
"We want the committee to tell us what kind of things we need to do so that banking is made available for funding Viksit Bharat," she told PTI videos in an interview.
Asked if it would suggest a merger of public sector banks, Ms. Sitharaman said one should not narrow it down like that.
"It is for India's banking sector to be made big enough, big enough in the sense, made or primed to take care of Viksit Bharat funding. You have to reach Viksit Bharat destination...it (Viksit Bharat) needs money, it needs financing, it needs credit, it needs banking facility to reach the common man." When asked about the timeframe for formation of the committee, she said, "We will do it at the earliest".
ALSO WATCH  Watch: Union Budget 2026 | Key takeaways
"I propose setting up a ‘High Level Committee on Banking for Viksit Bharat’ to comprehensively review the sector and align it with India's next phase of growth, while safeguarding financial stability, inclusion and consumer protection," she had said in the Budget speech on February 1, 2026.
To achieve scale and improve efficiency in the public sector NBFCs, as a first step, the Budget also proposed to restructure the Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and Rural Electrification Corporation (REC).
"A lot of work has happened in the ministry concerned. They have come up with this expectation. Let's see how they play it out," she said, when asked if a merger is on the cards.
REC is a subsidiary of State-owned power sector lender PFC. Both entities play a key role in funding power generation, transmission and distribution projects.
In March 2019, PFC completed the acquisition of a majority stake in REC Ltd by transferring ₹14,500 crore to the government.
PFC acquired 103.94 crore shares, constituting 52.63% stake, held by the government in REC, along with the management control. The acquisition price was worked out to ₹139.50 per share. This stake acquisition came following the in-principle approval from the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs.
Both PFC and REC are Navratna central public sector enterprises, and this acquisition was a step toward consolidating companies operating in the same space.
Last week, the PFC board gave in-principle approval for the merger of the non-banking finance company REC Limited with itself.
The board approval for the merger of PFC and REC came after an announcement made in this regard in the Budget on Sunday (February 1, 2026).

The Tamil Nadu government is currently studying the impact of the Home Again programme run by the non-governmental organisation (NGO) The Banyan, in collaboration with the government, and in partnership with other NGOs, in five districts. Based on this, it would like to take the programme to all districts in the State, said Chief Secretary N. Muruganandam.
Speaking at an event held to launch an impact report of the Emergency Care and Recovery Centre (ECRC) and Home Again programmes, on Saturday, he said halfway home initiatives were also being run, supported by the Department for the Welfare of the Differently Abled, and the impact of these were also being studied.
Mr. Muruganandam said the government was ensuring that residents of all homes for the mentally ill were being provided with services such as Aadhaar cards, pensions, ration cards, and priority was being given to them for housing and skill training.
He highlighted the importance of the need to focus on mental healthcare in the backdrop of the rising incidence of mental illness across the country, especially in a highly urbanised State such as Tamil Nadu, which also has a rising ageing population.
Earlier, during a panel discussion on sustainability and bridging care gaps, Supriya Sahu, Environment and Forests Secretary,  stressed the need for continuity of funding and community engagement in order to be able to ensure sustainability for any initiative, including the ECRC programme. J. Radhakrishnan, Chairman and Managing Director, TNEB, and Chairman, TNPGCL, underscored the need for attention during disasters during which vulnerable people were more affected.
P. Senthil Kumar, Health Secretary, said 32 districts had functional ERCR and seven more were in the pipeline, highlighting the challenges of mobilising resources and the need for further strengthening of systems. Speaking during a previous panel discussion M. Lakshmi, Commissioner for Welfare of the Differently Abled said the Home Again programme had helped reunite several people with their families, while many more had managed to find livelihood opportunities and reintegrate into society.
Archana Padmakar, chief executive officer, The Banyan, speaking on the impact report, noted the creation of 1,091 beds over five years for the homeless mentally ill, 138 Home Again houses across the country, and, significantly, the fact that 50% of those who accessed these services had gone back to their families, with re-admission rate being only 2%. She noted that a large number of those accessing the services had multiple co-morbidities including HIV, tuberculosis, diabetes, and suffered from malnutrition. She also highlighted The Banyan’s focus on smaller being better — smaller units, moving from custodial to community care, and patient-centric care.
The event also saw awards being presented to civil society organisations and government officials running ECRC and Home Again centres across the districts. Former Chief Secretary of Kerala, S.M. Vijayanand, Darez Ahmed, MD and CEO of GuidanceTN, Arun Thamburaj, Mission Director, National Health Mission, Tamil Nadu, and M. Malaiappan, Director, Institute of Mental Health, were among those who participated.

DMK president and Chief Minister M.K. Stalin said on Saturday (February 7, 2026) that Tamil Nadu should give “zero”-seat tally to the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the Assembly election as the BJP-led Union government had given “zero” to Tamil Nadu in the Union Budget and did not fulfil the genuine demands of the State.
Addressing the South Zone DMK Youth Wing conference near Kariyapatti in Virudhunagar district, Mr. Stalin said Tamil Nadu had been the ‘numero uno’ State in the country in all departments during the last five-year rule of the DMK. “It has been ranked number one in the Union government’s ratings and also by national and international magazines. Tamil Nadu’s progress has no parallel,” he said.
However, Tamil Nadu has got nothing in the Union Budget, belying the anticipation that the poll-bound State would get some benefits from the Union government. Mr. Stalin said all that Tamil Nadu demanded was more funds for disaster management, Metro Rail, drinking water schemes, and railway projects, permission for the new airport in Hosur, 50% devolution of Central funds to the State, exemption from NEET, expedited construction of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Madurai, and the promise of not reducing the number of Lok Sabha seats under delimitation. But nothing has been granted by the Union government. “They gave us zero. The BJP-led NDA should be given zero in the Assembly election, similar to what they got in the 2024 Lok Sabha election,” Mr. Stalin said.
He ridiculed AIADMK general secretary Edappadi K. Palaniswami for claiming that he was the head of the NDA in the State. However, the BJP has made the AIADMK a branch of the national party, and he was not raising his voice in the interest of Tamil Nadu, he alleged.
Mr. Stalin also criticised the AIADMK’s proposed protest against the DMK for preventing the Viksit Bharat-Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB-G RAM G) scheme.
“Does Mr. Palaniswami even know the name of this new scheme? The Union government did not give [funds for providing] jobs even for 50 days when the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme guaranteed jobs for 100 days. How will the Union government ensure that the jobs are given for 125 days as promised, this when the States have been made to contribute 40% of the funds [towards the scheme]?” he asked.
The BJP that has tasted only defeat in the State and the AIADMK, which has seen multiple defeats, should not only be defeated again in the upcoming Assembly election but also with a bigger margin to make the State more progressive, the Chief Minister added.

The Shahalibanda police registered a case of cheating and criminal intimidation against a person, following a complaint by a resident, who alleged financial fraud and threats linked to a failed business arrangement.
The complaint was lodged on Sunday by the victim, who said that he did not approach the police earlier as he was intimidated by the accused.
As per the police, Ayub Khan, a rowdy-sheeter, lured the victim into a business partnership in 2024, and asked him to invest ₹4.70 lakh. Later, the accused misappropriated the profits and took gold ornaments weighing about six tolas from the complainant on the pretext of clearing debts. The ornaments were allegedly mortgaged and not returned.
When the complainant sought settlement of his dues, Ayub allegedly threatened him with serious consequences, police said.

Launching a broadside against the Bharat Rashtra Samiti (BRS), Deputy Chief Minister Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka said the party which pushed the State into a debt burden of ₹8 lakh crore during its 10 years rule is now asking for votes in the upcoming municipal elections.
“Should people vote for a party that looted the State for 10 years,” he asked while addressing a public meeting after holding a huge election rally in the poll-bound Wyra town of Khammam district on Sunday.
Addressing a huge gathering on the penultimate day of electioneering, Mr. Vikramarka said, “The previous BRS rulers betrayed the people and looted public money, leaving the State in a precarious financial position. After coming to power, the Congress government implemented a plethora of pioneering welfare schemes for the welfare of all.”
These welfare initiatives include construction of Indiramma houses, free travel for women in the TGSRTC buses, free fine rice and free electricity of up to 200 units to households under Gruha Jyoti scheme.
He said, “The previous BRS government failed to conduct Group-I recruitment examination during its 10-years tenure. The Congress government has successfully conducted Group-I, Group-II and Group-III examinations and filled 70,000 government jobs within two years of coming to power.”
The “people’s government” initiated a slew of concrete measures to support women self-help groups by extending interest-free loans and providing skill development training in their pursuit of economic empowerment, he added.

The budget has brought some cheer to India’s research community, particularly for those involved in astronomy and space research, as it has earmarked ₹13,416.20 crore for the Department of Space for 2026-27.
A large chunk of the allocation has been set aside for deep-space exploration and astrophysics, including to build two advanced telescope facilities: the 30-m National Large Optical-Infrared Telescope and the National Large Solar Telescope near Pangong Lake in Ladakh.
Also in focus is the COSMOS-2 planetarium in Amaravati, Andhra Pradesh, to be completed soon, and improving the control systems of the Himalayan Chandra Telescope in Hanle, Ladakh. Currently, only the U.S., China, Japan and the European Union prioritise astronomy research to a high degree and constantly invest large sums to upgrade their terrestrial and space telescopes. So, astronomers have said, the telescope allocations will improve space research capability and science outreach in India.
However, experts also raised concerns about a significant drop in expenditure, with the actual expense falling short of budgetary estimates. This underutilisation has in the past led to bottlenecks in the planning and executing major projects.
“There were several proposed space missions which were finally not supported,” Bhaswati Mookerjea, professor and chairperson of the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, said.
Dr. Mookerjea added that although this budget “is an extremely positive step for astronomy in India,” the importance of following it through couldn’t be overstated: “The execution of big projects in India would still require some streamlining of resources with checks and balances.”
Only a few large astronomical observatories are capable of frontier research and groundbreaking discoveries worldwide, which means researchers have to compete for observation time. And when funding agencies favour their own national researchers, international scientists’ access becomes increasingly restricted, and Indians are no exception.
To make matters worse, an astrophysicist (who didn’t wish to be identified) told this reporter that India’s problem is compounded by the attitude of bureaucrats and administrators.
“They are close-minded regarding concepts like buying fractional time on large telescopes or missions — measures that are not only essential to foster stronger international collaborations and keep us at the forefront of astronomy research, but also serve as a stop-gap arrangement till we have our own large telescopes,” the astrophysicist said.
For far too long has the country relied on overseas facilities for high-resolution data and specialised equipment to do space science, including collaborative projects such as radio, optical, and space-based observations. Acquiring strong domestic capabilities in space science and astrophysics is thus imperative if India is to reduce its dependence on foreign observatories.
Building large-scale, next-generation observatories for cutting-edge space research, however, involves overcoming formidable financial and technological hurdles. These challenges often require collaborative partnerships with international teams and pooling resources and expertise with them is often the only way for Indian scientists to participate in ambitious projects. Adequate funding, effective governance and partnership with domestic industry offer a realistic solution to shrug off this dependence on foreign facilities and research data.
Fortunately, India’s astronomy and space research ecosystem is being steadily strengthened with the addition of cutting-edge technology platforms. These include optical and radio telescopes, such as the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) near Pune, and data processing centres capable of AI-driven data analysis. These efforts, alongside the new budgetary push, could boost India’s research capabilities, with the growing shift towards public-private partnerships in space research adding to the optimism.
“Basic science and big budget experiments all over the world require funding from state agencies” Dr. Mookerjea said. “While there are many private enterprises in the space sector, proper channeling of their efforts and overall quality control and monitoring would require setting up of statutory bodies involving government agencies.”
“In the past decade or so we have seen many startups in the space sector, often working in close collaboration with Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) experts,” Abhimanyu Susobhanan, assistant professor of physics at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Thiruvananthapuram, said. “The Department of Space established the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre in 2020 to promote such partnerships. This is a positive sign as such partnerships will promote innovation and attract private investment in the space sector.”
For that to happen, however, policymakers should acknowledge “the imperative for strategic resource allocation and collaborative initiatives to maximise the scientific output from the country’s astronomical assets.” But, he cautioned, “we also have to keep in mind that private interests may not always align with the interests of the nation as a whole.”
An important upside of developing homegrown cutting-edge resources in space science is that it will encourage students to engage in advanced research in the country, arresting the steady brain drain to institutions abroad. But that has been easier said, with a lot of homework still being required before it becomes a reality. For instance, the GMRT is the world’s largest radio telescope array operating at low frequencies and attracts astronomers from across the world. But in the absence of a comparable optical telescope in the country, Indian scientists are forced to stand in line for telescope time at foreign facilities, as they do for doing research in high frequency radio astronomy.
Similarly, India doesn’t have any telescope that operates in the critical sub-millimeter wavelengths.
“The sub-millimetre sky is a unique window for probing the architecture of the universe and structures within it, from the dusty sub-millimetre galaxies to the ringed nature of proto-stellar disks,” Dr. Mookerjea said. “A proposal is in the pipeline and it is also a part of the Astronomy & Astrophysics Mega Science Vision 2035.”
Only when such projects are realised can India’s march towards becoming a leader in space exploration gather pace.

TITLE: AAP leaders accuse Congress’ Bajwa of making derogatory remark against Punjab Cabinet Minister

The ruling AAP in Punjab on Sunday (February 8, 2026) slammed Congress leader Partap Singh Bajwa, accusing him of making objectionable remarks against Cabinet Minister Harbhajan Singh.
Congress leaders, however, rejected the charge and accused the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) of attempting to twist facts and misuse the sensitive issue of Dalits for political mileage by levelling false allegations against Mr. Bajwa.
In a joint statement in Chandigarh, Finance Minister Harpal Singh Cheema, Forest Minister Lal Chand Kataruchak, and AAP leader Baltej Pannu alleged that the Congress party has an “anti-Dalit” mindset and asked Mr. Bajwa to apologise within 24 hours, failing which strict legal action will be taken.
Mr. Cheema said Harbhajan Singh is a personality who rose out of poverty, cleared the civil services examination through hard work, and became an excise and taxation officer. He resigned from his job to join the Aam Aadmi Party, the Finance Minister added.
“The Aam Aadmi Party gave him respect and made him a Minister. But today, Partap Singh Bajwa used extremely derogatory words against him, which is an insult to the entire Dalit community,” Mr. Cheema claimed.
He alleged that all Dalit Ministers are on the Congress party’s target. Using such language against Dalits is extremely unfortunate, he said.
“This is a big insult to the Dalit community of Punjab. It is a matter that discourages children who move ahead in their lives through hard work in Punjab,” he added.
The Finance Minister further alleged that many Congress leaders are “repeatedly targeting Dalits and Scheduled Caste people of Punjab and insulting them in public rallies”.
Forest Minister Kataruchakk said that this is not a new remark by Mr. Bajwa. “From time to time, he targets leaders who rise from among workers and Dalits. Earlier, too, he made many comments against Dalit leaders,” he claimed.
AAP leader Pannu said that Mr. Bajwa's remark points to how much “hatred” Punjab Congress leaders carry in their minds about the Dalit community. “They are calling Harbhajan Singh a ‘band player’,” he said.
Defending Mr. Bajwa, Congress leader Aruna Chaudhry said that the AAP was attempting to create controversy out of a non-issue.
She said the people of Punjab, including the Dalit community, are politically aware and capable of recognising genuine casteist remarks without needing AAP to act as “self-appointed defenders”.
“AAP is rattled because Leader of Opposition Bajwa is exposing their failures and corruption both inside the Assembly and among the public. To divert attention, they are resorting to false narratives and baseless allegations,” she said in a statement.
Chairman of the Punjab Congress Scheduled Caste Cell, Kuldeep Vaid, said the AAP has crossed all limits of political decency by falsely accusing Mr. Bajwa of making a “casteist slur” against a Cabinet Minister.
There was no mention of any individual’s caste in Mr. Bajwa’s remarks, and AAP was deliberately misleading the public, he alleged.
“AAP leaders seem incapable of understanding the difference between a political pun and a casteist slur. Their attempt to provoke sentiments and exploit the Dalit community for political gain is highly condemnable,” Mr. Vaid said.
Several senior Congress leaders, including MLAs Vikram Chaudhry and Balwinder Singh Dhaliwal, along with Ex MLAs Pawan Kumar Adia, Santokh Singh Bhalaipur and Joginder Pal Bhoa, also came out in support of Mr. Bajwa.
They collectively condemned AAP’s attempt to malign his image and mislead the public.

Chief Minister M.K. Stalin being felicitated at a function by JACTTO-GEO for considering the demands of its members.
Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin said on Sunday that the Union government was creating a financial crisis in a planned manner for the State, and his government had been overcoming it not only politically but also administratively, even while fulfilling the demands of government employees.
He was speaking at a ceremony organised by the Joint Action Council of Tamil Nadu Teachers’ Organisation and Government Employees’ Organisation (JACTTO-GEO) to thank him for considering the demands of its members.
Mr. Stalin said the Tamil Nadu Assured Pension Scheme (TAPS) was implemented at a crucial juncture when the Centre had been consistently reducing the State’s share of tax revenue and was not releasing even the allocated funds properly. Changes in the Goods and Services Tax regime had reduced the State’s tax revenue, he said.
The DMK government had fulfilled the long-pending demands of teachers and government employees by recognising their valuable contribution to society. A government is a synthesis of elected representatives and its employees. The Council of Ministers and the government employees are two sides of a coin. This was the path shown by former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi, whose rule was a golden period for the government employees and teachers, he said.
Mr. Stalin said the government employees play a crucial role in delivering welfare schemes formulated by the government to the people. Calling the work done by the teachers a noble service to society, he said that because of them, Tamil Nadu stands as one of the best States for education in India.
He said the credit for the implementation of the DMK government’s flagship schemes since 2021 goes to the government employees. The Chief Minister said the Old Pension Scheme was stopped when the AIADMK was in power. This made the hard-working government employees suffer. But the DMK government was compassionate and inclusive, he said.

The Ernakulam rural police and the Excise on Sunday (February 8) registered nine cases under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act as they launched an intensive raid among migrant labourers in and around Perumbavoor amid a rise in complaints over drug peddling. Three migrant women, who were staying in lodges without valid documents, were taken into custody during the drive.
Searches were conducted in the dwelling places of migrant people, the market and buses by over 100 police and excise personnel. The dog squad and bomb squad were also involved in the raids led by Perumbavoor ASP Hardik Meena. The action was part of the steps initiated by District Police Chief (Ernakulam rural) K.S. Sudarshan to prevent conflict between residents and migrant labourers in the area.
As part of the measures, the police have decided to form a committee involving departments and organisations concerned and representatives of local people and migrants to address the law and order issues relating to the migrant population and local people, the police said on Sunday.
Perumbavoor sub-divisional police officer will be the convener of the committee, while the inspector of police, Perumbavoor station, will be the joint convener. Heads of Perumbavoor municipality and Vengola and Vazhakulam grama panchayats, as well as representatives of political, religious and cultural forums, will be the office-bearers of the panel.
The committee will be formed with the aim of conducting a comprehensive study into the alleged drug and alcohol use and related crimes among the migrant population and taking necessary steps. The committee will meet every month, and the police will chalk out their strategy based on the inputs from the meetings.
Earlier this week, the District Police Chief held a meeting with residents of Perumbavoor and assured action against offenders involved in the drug trade and other illegal activities. He also warned of strict action against vigilante activities by residents.

As denotified, nomadic, and semi-nomadic tribes (DNTs) across the country come together to demand a “separate column” for themselves in the 2027 Census forms, linguist and cultural scholar professor G.N. Devy has warned that India risks further alienating these communities—classified as “criminal” under the colonial-era 1871 Criminal Tribes Act and left uncounted since the formation of the Republic—if they are not explicitly counted.
In an exclusive interview with The Hindu, professor Devy—who headed the Ministry of Social Justice’s Technical Advisory Group on DNTs in 2006, and co-founded the DNT-Rights Action Group (DNT-RAG) with author Mahasweta Devi—said that inclusion of the DNTs must begin with a declaration by the Census Commissioner that these communities will be counted explicitly. He added that the problem of alienating over 10 crore people could become much bigger than that of counting them.
Edited Excerpts:
What opportunity does the upcoming Census present for the welfare of DNTs, given that caste will be enumerated in 2027?
The census and the Criminal Tribes Act (CTA) were both instituted in 1871. While the census has continued unbroken, except for this time, the plight of DNTs has also continued, with no proper count, except in 1931. The Iyengar Committee in 1950, the NHRC in the early 2000s, the Renke Commission in 2008, and the Idate Commission (2017) have all called for a census of DNTs. Yet questions such as ‘Have you been a DNT?, Have you been nomadic or semi-nomadic? Or denotified former criminal tribe?’ have never been included in Census schedules.
If that is not done this time, and if the DNTs are taken for a ride again with no specific data emerging at the end of the exercise, India will alienate close to 10 crore or more people from the mainstream. The problem can be much bigger than the problem of calculating, tabulating, and making a proper list.
This should have been a primary question even in the household surveys. It would be of great interest to any household surveyor to account for nomadic communities. People without houses are counted as a general classification. That speaks about houseless people, but not about DNTs.
This exclusion has been the worst. This is a motiveless malignity, and the census has no reason to exclude them. But the Census excludes them just because it did so earlier.
How can the government ensure the Census is truly inclusive of DNTs?
First, the census should declare that DNTs will be enumerated. That message will go around the communities across the country. Now, saying that “we will enumerate everybody, and therefore that will also include DNTs’, is like saying that “we are not doing an independent and exclusive census of the DNTs”. So that must be done. They do not need any special permission to introduce the question.
Secondly, the technology used should be accessible. Where it is not, there must be a system for people to go to an office and declare their DNT status. Third, the Census must avoid creating a long and unmanageable list of documents, because historically, even panchayats have refused to issue birth certificates to DNTs. And the fourth, after the census gets its data on DNTs, they must quickly consult the Anthropological Survey of India and get that data verified. And this data must be open for scrutiny by scholars as far as the DNTs issue is concerned.
There is a resentment among many DNT communities over their misclassification into SC/ST/OBC lists when they seek a list of their own. Must the DNT classification be exclusive of these identities?
The question of identity is never singular. The DNT identity is not exclusive of other identities. There is intersectionality. This is a complexity in the bureaucratic process. I accept that. But that is no fault of the DNTs. We cannot tell them that we have already messed up our bureaucratic processes, and therefore, we can no longer think of you. That’s not a good justification. These processes can be improved. Fortunately, with the help of technology, multiple classifications and multiple classificatory tags can be sorted out easily.
Amidst calls for separate quotas for DNTs, exclusive of SC, ST, and OBC identities (where they might exist), how can these reservations account for this intersectionality?
The demands for reservations, DNT reservations, and DNT representation in the Assembly, Panchayat or Parliament have been around for quite a while. But there are two different issues: the first is just to count the DNTs and create a factual report on who they are, where they are, and how many they are. The second question is whether they should be given reservations or not. That will depend on the results of the Census.
The political decisions on whether to give reservations to DNTs or not and whether it should be aligned with the SC or ST reservation, or independent, are the next step. But in the absence of credible data, no such decision can be taken at all. To fear that such a decision will have to be taken, and therefore not to do enumeration, is not a logical line of action. Let the count take place first. Governments can then decide, and the people themselves will also know whether to demand reservations or drop the demand.

Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal on Sunday (February 8, 2026) refuted any allegations of friction between him and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and that Ministers other than him did not know the contours of the agreement with the U.S., telling The Hindu in an interview that “people have mixed up two different issues”.
In the interview, as well as in previous press conferences, Mr. Goyal said that the Ministry of External Affairs would answer questions on whether India would be stopping its Russian oil imports, as U.S. President Donald Trump has claimed.
Opposition parties had alleged that even Mr. Jaishankar was not answering the question, and was instead passing it on to the Commerce Minister, citing an interview Mr. Jaishankar gave during his trip to Washington.
Watch: U.S.-India trade deal | What are the red flags? | Worldview
“See the question to which he [Mr. Jaishankar] replied,” Mr. Goyal said in the interview. “The question was about the nuances of the trade deal. So if there’s anything about the trade deal, obviously I will reply. People have mixed up two different issues.”
“If you ask the Agriculture Minister about the trade deal, he won’t answer,” he added. “If you ask me about what’s happening with, let’s say, the oil mission, I wouldn’t be able to respond. I would have a general idea, but I would not like to make a statement on record without full knowledge of facts. Each person handles his own responsibility.”
India-U.S. trade deal: Piyush Goyal rejects claims India yielded to U.S. demands
Mr. Goyal also sought to address the concerns of the farmers unions as well, asserting that “not a single farmer had anything to worry about” as sensitive items have been excluded from the deal, while others have been dealt with through quotas, phased duty eliminations, and margins of preference.
“Different tools have been used to protect our farmers, so I see absolutely no reason for any farmer to complain,” he said.
Excerpts from the interview:
What has been the departure in this deal from India’s previous relationship with the U.S.?
I think it’s in continuation of our very strong and important strategic relationship. They are one of our most important partners in the world. We are both large democracies. We have shared interests in several sectors. We have a strong defence partnership. We have a strong technology partnership. We have a strong critical minerals partnership. We also are members of two Quads together, so it’s a very, very powerful relationship. The trade agreement further enhances our relationship and elevates it to a much deeper friendship.
But didn’t these trade issues create a knot in that relationship?
As much as we expand our cooperation and engagement with the world’s largest economy, a $30 trillion market that is opening up for us, I’m sure it will only be good for the country.
Were the negotiations difficult?
Not at all. It was just like any other negotiation. Every country has to work towards getting a fair, equitable and balanced agreement. Everybody has sensitivities, just like we have sensitivities of, let’s say, certain farm produce. They have sensitivities on certain produce on their end. Everybody ensures that you take care of your defensive interests. And clearly everybody is looking for openings, new opportunities to expand trade in a manner that the people, the businesses of both countries can benefit.
Could you give us some insight on the behind-the-scenes process?
I would think more work happened virtually. And that’s one of the learnings from COVID. Most negotiations happened virtually right until the end. I was here, my teams were here, and they were there. We would have phone calls of and on if the issue was small, if it was substantive we would have video conferences.
What was the one issue that took time to reach an agreement on?
I don’t think there’s any such issues, any one issue that was a road block to the agreement. It was a very smooth and very amiable dialogue in a very friendly atmosphere with a lot of fun and frolic and laughter and also intense negotiation.
Our red line was related to agriculture…
Largely. All of India’s sensitivities, every single one of them, have been safeguarded. The sensitivities have been protected by carefully seeing what are the products where India is self-sufficient, farmers have good production, we don’t import at present or will not be required to import, and we have excluded these from the scope of this agreement.
So meat is not covered, for example, except turkey. Poultry is excluded. Dairy is excluded. No GM food products are included. No concessions have been given on soybean, corn, rice, wheat, sugar, cereals, millets like jawar, bajra, raggi, kodo, amaranth, fruits like banana, strawberries, cherries, citrus fruits, pulses in which we are self-sufficient in India, like green peas, kabuli chana, moong, oil seeds, certain animal feed, ground nuts, honey, malt and its extracts, non-alcoholic beverages, flour and the meals made of flour, starch, essential oils, ethanol for fuel, and tobacco, among others.
So after this, the farmers have really no cause for complaint and have absolutely nothing to be worried about.
But some farmer groups, such as those growing cotton, are unhappy…
This will help cotton farmers because exports can grow leaps and bounds. We have a competitive edge in textiles compared to our competitors. Now, markets in the U.K., Europe, EFTA countries, Australia, New Zealand, so many new markets, all in the developed world, at 0% duty are going to support our textiles. In America, our reciprocal tariff of 18% is amongst the lowest among our peer group of competing economies, so effectively the demand for cotton is going to go up.
We do need to import the extra long staple cotton, which we don’t have in India in insufficient quantity. So, if we give them an opening in or a quota in cotton, it’s actually good for the Indian ecosystem. Exports will grow, and as exports grow, the demand for domestic cotton also grows.
There’s so many items where they are opening up the large U.S. market for our farm produce and processed foods to be exported. We already are a large exporter. We export $54 billion-$55 billion every year of these products. In that situation, we are now looking at how we can double that.
Sadly, the opposition parties have such a small and weak mindset that they’re trying to distort the story and misguide our innocent farmers. I want them to understand that we are opening up new opportunities in Europe, US, Australia, New Zealand.
Further to that, with the U.S., we have also got 0% reciprocal tariff on a large variety of agriculture products such as spices, masalas, tea, coffee and their extract, copra and coconut oil, many nuts like areca nut, Brazil nut, cashew nut, chestnut, which you make in India, fruits and vegetables like avocado bananas, guavas, mangos, kiwis, papayas, pineapples, shiitake mushrooms.
What are the areas where American demands could be accommodated?
There are many areas, like tree nuts, for example. We have been importing pistachios for decades, right from the Congress time. There are certain things in which you don’t have in sufficient quantity and we’ve done a very calibrated opening in all of these products.
Wherever we need those products, we have opened them. Wherever we think we need to also keep a restriction, we have kept quotas. In some cases, we’re giving a margin of preference, not a full duty reduction. In some cases, it’s a phased elimination over a period of time. So, different tools have been used to protect our farmers, so I see absolutely no reason for any farmer to complain.
One general concern has been the commitment to buy $500 billion of US goods…
Well, it’s an intention. And it comes out of the fact that we have a big demand for particular goods that you don’t have in India, which we have to import. For example, energy such as crude oil, LNG, LPG, we have to import, we don’t have it in sufficient quantity in India. In aircraft, we have already placed orders worth $50 billion with Boeing. In addition to that, we need engines and spare parts. Plus the airline companies tell us they’re placing more orders.
We’ll probably need anywhere between $80-100 billion of planes and their parts and engines in the next 5 years. On ICT products, when we give concessions to data centres and hope to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in data centres and AI and quantum computing, we will need equipment, we will need NVIDIA chips and GPUs.
We made an assessment and we realised that even today we are importing $300 billion of these goods from different parts of the world. A large part of it comes from geographies that are not our preferred sources.
Is this deal concentrating our supply chain towards the US?
This $300 billion that we are importing right now is growing every year. We estimate that in the next 5 years, we will need $2 trillion of all of these products, which can also come from the US. I have a full intention to buy that and to diversify from our existing sources.
The joint statement mentions that the two countries would take “complementary actions to address non-market policies of third parties”. Is this aimed at China?
I would not like to speculate on any one particular geography, but any country that has non-market economy practises, we have to take care against such countries that distort the market. They affect jobs, business opportunities, and investments in our country, and therefore, we work with trusted partners and America is one of our most trusted partners. We would like to engage with them on these issues in a spirit of cooperation.
Our trade deals with some other countries involved liberalising Indian labour movement, but this one does not…
None of the trade deals ever deal with immigration. Trade deals have an element of people for implementing the objectives of the trade deal. So, for example, if somebody gets a contract to do the plumbing in a hotel in Switzerland, I will need to send people to do the plumbing. So trade deals only address mobility from that perspective. Even with the European Union, the deal we have provided is that if somebody goes as a student, they will get a nine month visa to be able to work there.
Every trade deal stands on its own legs, but bear in mind, immigration is never discussed in a trade deal. So even with the European Union, the mobility partnership is outside the trade deal. It’s a separate partnership.
The joint statement also had a line that says that both countries can modify their commitments if the other changes agreed upon tariffs. Did India insist on this inclusion?
It’s a standard WTO provision, that if any country changes the situation that exists at the type of entering into an agreement to the detriment of the other country, by which the effects of the free trade agreement don’t flow as they are intended to flow, then the other country has a right to rebalance. It’s also not that we are doing it for the first time.
Do you think that now the older multilateral organisations, especially economic ones like the WTO are now redundant?
Not at all. Multilateral organisations play a very important role. India respects WTO rules of trade. I believe they add value to the global order, to the rules-based global trading business. But I think we have to accept that with changing times, there will be some changes. We are actively in dialogue at the WTO to look at WTO reforms.
The question of great interest is on India’s policy on Russian oil…
I don’t deal with that subject. It is not part of my joint statement or the trade deal.
But your colleague in the Ministry of External Affairs made a statement that he’s not dealing with that issue and that you are.
See the question to which he replied. The question was about the nuances of the trade deal. So if there’s anything about the trade deal, obviously I will reply. People have mixed up two different issues. If you ask the agriculture minister about the trade deal, he can’t answer. If you ask me about what’s happening with, let’s say, the oil mission, I wouldn’t be able to respond. I would have a general idea, but I would not like to make a statement on record without full knowledge of facts. Each person handles his own responsibility.
Do you still feel that we will see the formal agreement by mid-March?
Oh yes. Unlike with other countries, where we did the framework agreement and then got down to the nitty-grities, in the U.S. case, we’ve done a full negotiation of all the issues literally line by line. So, the negotiation part is nearly complete. We’ll be able to close it quickly.
The joint statement came before because the reciprocal tariff has to come down to 18%. The executive order of reducing it to 18%, we hope to see next week.

Promising help to Karnataka in uplifting farmers through infrastructure development, Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Sunday said that the Centre will, without any discrimination, help the State in agri processing and value addition activities to help increase farmers’ income.
“The Centre will not discriminate farmers based on their political affiliations. It is the responsibility of the State and the Central governments to work for farmers’ welfare. Farmers are above all political affiliation,” he said here at the valedictory function of the International Trade Fair.
His statement came in response to State Agriculture Minister N. Cheluvarayaswamy who, pointing out at effective implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Formalisation of Micro food processing Enterprises, sought further financial assistance in different schemes for developing food parks, cold storages, transport services, branding and exports of Karnataka’s agri produce to bring better income to farmers.
Mr. Cheluvarayaswamy also said that agriculture should grow beyond politics.
Offering a slew of helping measures from the Centre, the Union Minister said that though Karnataka is the largest producer of toor dal in the country, the average yield per hectare is less than the national average. “Under pulse mission, the Centre will offer help to increase productivity through scientific and technical support.”
Announcing the setting up of 25 ‘seed villages’, he said that the Centre will particularly assist setting up of ‘seed villages’ where farmers would produce their own seeds, in the toor dal growing regions of the State.
“The Centre will encourage FPOs, farmers’ organisations, and private sector with a financial support of ₹25 lakh each to set up 35 dal mills,” he said.
Acknowledging that coconut production had declined owing to old or disease-afflicted coconut plantations, Mr. Chouhan said that the Coconut Development Board will encourage the planting of new high yielding varieties of coconut. Technical teams have been set up to help prevent diseases in coconut trees, and that Karnataka should utilise their services, he added.
The Union Minister said: “Rice varieties that could reduce labour cost, consume 20% less water and could be harvested 18 to 20 days earlier are being developed. The ICAR is developing special varieties that could suit the needs of Karnataka. The Centre will help Karnataka take its millets and processed food produce to the international market.”
He also said that the Centre will release ₹154 crore under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana shortly along with another ₹191 crore.
The Union Agriculture Minister also visited the Indian Institute of Horticulture Research here and interacted with scientists to understand research and extension activities. He also interacted with farmers and incubatees who have benenfited from IIHR technologies. He also interacted with directors of the ICAR institutes located in Bengaluru.

Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy clarified that the government was neither considering abolishing any existing district nor creating new districts at this stage, and asked the people not to fall for the scare being generated by the Bharat Rashtra Samiti (BRS).
Mr. Reddy strongly objected to what he described as “false propaganda” being spread by the BRS over the reorganisation of districts in Telangana. He categorically denied claims that the Bhupalpally district was being abolished, asserting that there was no such proposal before the government. The BRS was deliberately misleading the public by circulating rumours.
The Chief Minister said any future discussion on district reorganisation would be taken up only after seeking the opinions of all stakeholders and the Opposition parties, and holding a detailed debate in the State Assembly. He cautioned people against falling prey to what he termed the Opposition party’s “conspiracy politics” aimed at gaining political mileage through misinformation.
Mr. Reddy also rebutted allegations made by the BRS on Singareni Collieries issues and clarified that the medical unfit board would be removed. He assured that recruitment on compassionate grounds in Singareni would continue without interruption. Further, the government would take steps to resolve the long-pending issue of 217 dismissed Singareni workers, the Chief Minister said, reiterating his government’s commitment to protecting workers’ interests.

Asaduddin Owaisi
All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) president Asaduddin Owaisi criticised Karimnagar MP Bandi Sanjay Kumar, questioning the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s nationalism claims over reduced Russian oil procurement, and said a vote for Bharat Rashtra Samithi would help the BJP.
Mr. Owaisi was addressing a public meeting in Karimnagar, where the party has fielded 15 candidates for the upcoming municipal elections. He said the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh must explain their silence after the USA reportedly warned of reimposing 25% ad valorem duty if India continued to buy Russian oil, directly or indirectly.
He sought to know where the BJP’s nationalism was when a “white-skinned” foreign leader was issuing threats over India’s sovereign economic decisions. He claimed that India had reduced Russian oil imports while China benefited by buying cheaper crude oil.
Turning to local issues, Mr. Owaisi said that despite Karimnagar being listed as a Smart City, basic infrastructure such as roads, drainage and electricity remained inadequate, with Muslim localities especially neglected. He also alleged that, at the behest of the local MLA, 25 houses were demolished overnight in the city.
Taking a dig at Karimnagar legislator Gangula Kamalakar, Mr.Owaisi said the latter had retained his Assembly seat earlier only because of the AIMIM’s support. He warned that after the elections, the legislator would gravitate towards the BJP and asserted that a vote for the BRS in Karimnagar would effectively aid the BJP. He appealed to voters not to back such candidates, describing it a waste of their mandate.
Mr.Owaisi also urged mosque committees and Muslim scholars to speak out against the Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls. He alleged that the BJP intended to harass and disenfranchise Muslims not through the Citizenship Amendment Act, NRC or NPR, but through the SIR process.

Several irrigation projects in Karnataka have either stalled or slowed down owing to inaction by the Union government, said Chief Minister Siddaramaiah at Siraguppi village in Dharwad district on February 8.
He was speaking at the launch of several development works in Navalgund Assembly constituency, including a restraining wall to control floods in Bennihalla. The event was organised by the Water Resources Department and Karnataka Irrigation Corporation Limited. The flood control infrastructure will cost an estimated ₹200 crore in the first phase. The Chief Minister launched around 72 development works at the cost of ₹150 crore.
“The third phase of the Krishna Upper River Project has been stalled by the Union government. We have urged the Union Ministers concerned to issue a gazette notification that can enable us to start work, but in vain. Similarly, the Union government is yet to provide the necessary clearances to the Kalasa Banduri Nala project. The Central Wildlife Board is yet to approve our application, though the other departments have issued clearances and the Supreme Court approved the project in 2018. If all permissions are obtained, the work can start tomorrow itself,” the Chief Minister said.
On the Mekedatu drinking water project, Mr. Siddarmaiah said the project involves the usage of 65 tmcft of water. But it is stuck as the Union government is yet to clear the State’s proposals. The courts have already dismissed objections filed by Tamil Nadu, he added.
“The Upper Bhadra River project was considered a project of national importance in the Union Budget. The Centre promised to release ₹5,300 crore for the same, but no money has been released so far,’’ the Chief Minister pointed out.
“Some people are going around saying that the Karnataka government is not taking up development works as it has exhausted resources on guarantee schemes. That is far from the truth,” Mr. Siddaramaiah stated.
He added that several development works are under way across the State. “For example, we have taken all necessary steps to start work on the Kalasa Banduri Nala project. Since the Supreme Court approved the project, we called and finalised tenders and fixed the agency. However, work is yet to begin as we have not received the necessary clearances from the Union government,’’ the Chief Minister said, adding that “our government has spent around ₹25,000 crore on irrigation projects since coming to power’’.
He said that the Union government is collecting ₹4–5 lakh crore in taxes from Karnataka, but is releasing grants of only around ₹60,000 crore. “We have raised our objections against this,’’ he noted.
The Chief Minister criticised the BJP-led NDA government for introducing the VB-G RAM G scheme after making several changes to the MGNREGA Act. “For two decades, this scheme provided livelihood to rural folk, reduced distress migration to cities, and ended starvation deaths,” he added.
A look at the beneficiary statistics of MGNREGA reveals that 53% of beneficiaries were women. Out of the total beneficiaries, 28% are from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes — 17% and 11%, respectively. “The welfare scheme that aimed to provide jobs to the youth, women, and the unemployed has been abandoned. It is extremely unfortunate. However, we will not keep quiet. We will fight against this. We will fight to re-establish the MGNREGA scheme,” Mr. Siddaramaiah stated.
He said he is committed to making Navalgund a model constituency. “Several development works have been launched in the constituency. There are demands to build an underground drainage system in Annigeri town. It will be discussed before the Budget,” the Chief Minister noted, adding that the ₹200-crore flood prevention project was taken up at the insistence of N.H. Konaraddi, MLA.
Earlier, an estimated cost report of ₹1,610 crore was submitted to the Union government. “But since the Centre delayed approvals, we decided to take up the first phase at a cost of ₹200 crore. Due to the flash floods in the stream, about 37 villages and 20,000 hectares of land were flooded. This will be avoided by the restraining wall and other structures,’’ the Chief Minister said.
Mr. Siddaramaiah said he is a believer in Basavanna’s ideology of “inclusive and not othering”. We are running a welfare state. We have spent around ₹1.16 lakh crore on the five guarantee schemes. About ₹54,000 crore is used annually for the guarantee project. On an average, ₹4,000–5,000 is given to every family each month, or around ₹50,000 per year in direct benefits, he said.
Ministers H.K. Patil, Satish Jarkiholi, Santosh Lad, Prasad Abbayya, MLA, Salim Ahmed and F.H. Jakkappanavar, MLCs, leaders Shakir Sanadi and S.R. Patil, I.G. Sanadi, former MP, A.H. Hindasgeri, former Minister, Kusumavati Shivalli, former MLA, and others were present.

Jan Suraaj founder Prashant Kishor on Sunday (February 8, 2026) launched the ‘Bihar Navnirman Yatra’ from West Champaran district, saying the campaign would focus on rebuilding and strengthening the organisation across the State.
Despite attracting significant public attention, Jan Suraaj failed to win a single seat in the 2025 Bihar Assembly elections, where it contested 238 seats.
Talking to reporters in Bettiah, Mr. Kishor said, “The yatra will focus on rebuilding and strengthening the party’s organisation across the State to present an honest and accountable political alternative in Bihar.”
He asserted that the party has remained active among the people even after the Assembly elections, and the yatra will now help it expand and reorganise its grassroots network at the district level.
“To ensure that our Bihar Navnirman Abhiyan materialises seamlessly on the ground, I will spend some time in each district and meet old associates and new aspiring ones to strengthen the party’s organisational structure,” Mr. Kishor said.
Mr. Kishor asserted that during his yatra, the party will address the issue of a poll promise related to financial assistance for women under the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rozgar Yojana.
Under the programme, the State Government transferred ₹10,000 each to 1.56 crore women in Bihar in multiple phases, with a major proportion receiving the funds before the polls. The government had announced that the beneficiaries will later be provided up to ₹2 lakh each to build on their businesses.
“Jan Suraj workers would reach households across the district to ensure that the benefit is delivered to women. Government’s failure to fulfil the commitment would indicate that the announcement was made only for electoral gains,” Mr. Kishor claimed.
Notably, the Bihar Government, in its cabinet meeting on January 29, had decided to provide the additional financial assistance of up to ₹2 lakh to selected beneficiaries of the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rozgar Yojana after an assessment period of six months.
“The amount will be given in phases to the women entrepreneurs who will properly utilise the ₹10,000 fund at the end of the assessment period,” a statement issued by the government noted.

--------------------
A day after admitting to receiving funds from the proprietor of the Nedumparambil Credit Syndicate (NCS), Pathanamthitta MP Anto Antony on Sunday found himself at the centre of a political storm over alleged opaque election funding.
The Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] has seized on the admission by the Congress MP to mount a direct challenge, preparing to move the Election Commission on the charge that Mr. Antony failed to disclose the receipt of campaign funds in his official expenditure statement.
Speaking to mediapersons here on Sunday, Health Minister Veena George, who lost to Mr. Antony in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, sharpened the attack by publicly questioning the scale and source of his campaign finances. “Did he actually spend ₹2 crore during the election? Did he disclose the receipt of this fund to the Election Commission and while submitting his annual income tax returns?” Ms. George asked.
K.P. Udayabhanu, a CPI(M) State committee member and the first to raise allegations of financial fraud against the Pathanamthitta MP, went a step further by demanding a detailed probe into alleged land transactions involving Mr. Antony in Bengaluru. He also wanted the Special Investigation Team probing the Sabarimala gold scandal to examine Mr. Antony’s financial transactions in Bengaluru.
The Enforcement Directorate, which is probing alleged money laundering by the non-banking financial company, too has included this aspect within the scope of its investigation.
Mr. Antony, however, declined to respond to media queries on the controversy. Earlier, he had acknowledged receiving funds from N.M. Raju, the NCS proprietor, to finance his election campaign and claimed that the amount was repaid within two months. He, however, has refused to disclose the amount actually received from this source, fuelling speculation. Mr. Raju, on the other hand, has maintained that the MP received the money without any documentation and is yet to repay the amount.

Digi Kerala 2.0, the second phase of the State government’s digital literacy programme, is set to be launched with focus on cyber security, artificial intelligence (AI) awareness, training for using the Local Self-Government department’s K-SMART application, and digitisation of basic documents.
On August 21, 2025, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had declared Kerala as the first fully digitally literate State in India, marking the completion of the first phase of the Digi Kerala project, a grassroot-level intervention across all local bodies to bridge the digital divide. In the first phase, as many as 21.87 lakh people were trained in the usage of digital devices for basic purposes.
One of the major focus areas of the second phase of the project is cyber security, considering the increasing number of cyber fraud cases in recent times. People will be trained to identify various threats hidden in online spaces and the possible ways in which fraudulent operatives target victims. Added to this, the focus on AI awareness will help the trainees not only to get an idea of the possibilities of AI and its responsible use, but also to identify AI-generated content which is often used on online platforms to propagate fake narratives.
The State government had in 2024 launched the K-SMART application to make available services of local self-government bodies digitally over a uniform platform. Services including building permit applications, civil registration applications, trade licenses, and grievance redressal are now being delivered through K-SMART.
Minister for Local Self-Governments M.B. Rajesh had said during the first phase of the project that it was part of the government’s long-term plan to equip all sections of the population with the knowledge of accessing digital services after it made available most of its services online through the K-SMART platform.
After undergoing training under Digi Kerala 2.0, the trainees will be able to use K-SMART without approaching help desks or third parties. The trainees will also be equipped to use the DigiLocker service to digitise all basic documents.

The Transport Department on Sunday stated that it would implement the Rah-Veer scheme across the State to encourage citizens to provide immediate assistance to road accident victims and help reduce fatalities. The move entails a cash incentive of ₹25,000 to those who save lives.
According to the scheme, people who come forward as “Good Samaritans “ and help save the life of an accident victim will be recognised and rewarded by the government. They will be called Rah-Veers and apart from the cash incentive, they will be given a certificate of appreciation.
The department said a circular had been issued to all District Collectors to constitute district-level committees so as to lay down the procedure for selection and ensure wide publicity of the initiative. Details of those who provide immediate assistance and shift victims to hospitals will be recorded by the police and hospital authorities, following which cases will be recommended to the district committee for scrutiny.
These committees will be headed by the concerned District Collector. They will forward approved names to the Transport Commissioner for release of the incentive.

With a focus on enhancing defence cooperation, Greek Defence Minister Nikos Dendias and Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh will hold a bilateral meeting on Monday (February 9, 2026) at the Manekshaw Centre in New Delhi.
The discussions are expected to focus on enhancing cooperation in the defence sector, a senior Defence official said.
Speaking at the India-EU Forum 2026 on Saturday (February 7, 2026), Mr. Dendias described India as an indispensable partner for Europe, highlighting New Delhi’s growing strategic and economic importance for the European Union and Greece in particular. He noted that European perceptions of India have evolved significantly over time, adding that India is now viewed as a “necessary-to-have” partner.
Defence ties between India and Greece have seen steady momentum in recent months. In January this year, the two countries held the inaugural India-Greece Joint Services Staff Talks in New Delhi, marking a step towards institutionalising defence cooperation.
Earlier, in September 2025, the Indian Navy and the Hellenic Navy conducted their maiden bilateral maritime exercise in the Mediterranean Sea. The exercise, which concluded on September 18, 2025, was carried out in two phases, a harbour phase at Salamis Naval Base from 13 to 17 September, followed by a sea phase on 17 and 18 September. The Indian Navy was represented by the guided missile stealth frigate INS Trikand.
The upcoming ministerial talks are expected to further consolidate the growing defence partnership between the two countries.

TITLE: ‘Kerala Will See Change’: Amit Shah Slams ‘Failed Development’ Under Communists Ahead Of Polls
LINK: https://www.news18.com/politics/kerala-will-see-change-amit-shah-slams-failed-development-under-communists-ahead-of-polls-9888819.html
--------------------
With months left for the Kerala Assembly elections, Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday criticised the communist government in the state and said India must move away from communist ideology. He said Kerala would soon see change.
Speaking at an event titled ‘Chhattisgarh@25: Shifting The Lens’, the Union Home Minister said the government intends to completely eliminate Maoist influence and urged people to recognise what he described as the damaging effects of communist ideology.
According to him, regions under communist rule have lagged in development. He also alleged that, in the name of tribal welfare, people were pushed towards armed activity, calling the ideology destructive in nature.
Shah said, “We will uproot the Maoist problem from its roots. But the public of this country must understand this ideology. Wherever communist rule has existed, development has failed to take place. In the name of tribal welfare, people were instead handed weapons. This ideology itself is a symbol of destruction."
He added that communists barely exist today. “Today, communists have to be searched for with a telescope- they barely exist anymore. Only Kerala remains, and this time that too will come to an end. The people themselves will do it. The people of Thiruvananthapuram have already begun," he said.
Shah also appealed to Maoists to surrender and said the government would welcome them. He said the country needs to get rid of the “destructive" communist ideology at the earliest.

TITLE: After Poll Setback, Prashant Kishor Launches ‘Bihar Navnirman Yatra’ To Rebuild Jan Suraaj
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/after-poll-setback-prashant-kishor-launches-bihar-navnirman-yatra-to-rebuild-jan-suraaj-ws-l-9888664.html
--------------------
Jan Suraaj founder Prashant Kishor on Sunday launched the ‘Bihar Navnirman Yatra’ from West Champaran, saying the campaign aims to rebuild and strengthen the organisation across the state.
Even after attracting significant public attention, Jan Suraaj failed to win a single seat in the 2025 Bihar Assembly elections, where it contested 238 seats.
After launching the yatra, Kishor said, “The yatra will focus on rebuilding and strengthening the party’s organisation across the state to present an honest and accountable political alternative in Bihar."
He said the party has continued its engagement with the public even after the Assembly elections and that the yatra will help expand and reorganise its grassroots network at the district level.
“To ensure that our Bihar Navnirman Abhiyan materialises seamlessly on the ground, I will spend some time in each district, and meet old associates and new aspiring ones to strengthen the party’s organisational structure," Kishor said.
He said that during his yatra, the party will address the issue of a poll promise related to financial assistance for women under the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rozgar Yojana.
Under the scheme, the state government transferred Rs 10,000 each to 1.56 crore women in Bihar in multiple phases, with a large number receiving the amount ahead of the elections. The government has said the beneficiaries will later be eligible to receive up to Rs 2 lakh each to expand their businesses.
“Jan Suraj workers would reach households across the district to ensure that the benefit is delivered to women. Government’s failure to fulfil the commitment would indicate that the announcement was made only for electoral gains," Kishor claimed.
The Bihar cabinet on January 29 cleared up to Rs 2 lakh in additional assistance for selected beneficiaries of the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rozgar Yojana after a six-month review.
“The amount will be given in phases to the women entrepreneurs who will properly utilise the Rs 10,000 fund at the end of the assessment period," a statement issued by the government noted.

TITLE: Delhi CM Rekha Gupta Launches 500 EV Buses, DTC Fleet Touches 4,286

--------------------
Chief Minister Rekha Gupta said that the Delhi government on Sunday launched 500 electric buses, taking the total EV fleet of the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) to 4,286.
She attended the launch of 500 EV buses and the Delhi–Panipat inter-state bus service at Ramlila Maidan.
Rekha Gupta said that Ramlila Maidan symbolises a turning point in Delhi’s political history, recalling how previous governments had “deceived the people and betrayed their trust" at the same venue. She added that it was now through Ramlila Maidan that her government had earned the confidence of Delhi’s citizens and presented them with a promise of development.

“This step will not only boost transportation and connectivity in the city but also help in cutting down air pollution," Gupta said at the launch event which was also attended by BJP president Nitin Nabin.
She said by 2028, the DTC plans to increase its total bus fleet to 14,000. “These EV buses will help improving the air quality and the transport needs of the city. These are AC buses, low-floor with panic buttons and several other features," she added.
Transport Minister Pankaj Singh said that three inter-state bus services connecting Delhi and Panipat have also been launched.
“Delhi government is constantly working on the transport sector. One such measure is providing last mile connectivity to residents. We have recently signed an MoU with Bharat Taxi in this regard and soon a new EV policy and an E-rickshaw policy will also be in place," the chief minister said.
Delhi Minister Parvesh Verma on Sunday spoke about the launch of 500 electric buses and the Delhi–Panipat inter-state bus service at Ramlila Maidan, saying the developments marked the beginning of a larger transformation.
He said the initiatives were “just the trailer" and that the “full picture is yet to come," recalling that exactly one year ago the people of Delhi had given the Bharatiya Janata Party 48 seats.
Thanking the public for their support, Verma added that several projects had already been initiated and many more would be rolled out in the coming months.

TITLE: ‘Not Surrender, It’s Negotiation’: Pakistani Analyst Decodes India-US Trade Agreement | Exclusive
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/not-surrender-its-negotiation-pakistani-analyst-decodes-india-us-trade-agreement-exclusive-ws-l-9888326.html
--------------------
Pakistani analyst Najam Sethi called the India-US interim trade agreement “a negotiation".
“It is not a surrender. It is a negotiation. These decisions don’t happen overnight. The negotiations must have gone on for months. PM Modi was quiet throughout," said Sethi.
“It is not zero tariff on all items…It includes items that are no threat to Indian industries," he said
The analyst said PM Modi negotiated smartly while the Indian opposition is creating unnecessary fuss. Sethi said that India’s zero-tariff concessions apply only to a small, specific list of US items such as certain wines, cosmetics, soybean oil, tree nuts, and processed fruits, not a broad flood of goods These reductions cover very few products and won’t significantly hurt domestic sectors or undermine Make in India, as the deal protects sensitive areas like dairy, grains, and key agriculture, he said.
Many in Pakistan, including analysts like Sethi, see this as a smart bargain by Modi and India gains better access without losing much, making the opposition’s noise seem unnecessary and politically motivated.
Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal on Saturday underlined the government’s commitment to farmers while concluding the framework of the bilateral trade agreement with the US. In his statement, the Minister said that dairy, fruits, vegetables, spices, and other grains have been protected in the India-US trade deal to safeguard the interests of domestic farmers.
In a post on X, Piyush Goyal said the trade deal will mark a powerful step forward in the direction of a self-reliant India.
“Farmers Safe, Country Developed… In the India-US trade agreement, dairy, fruits, vegetables, spices, and other grains have been protected. This will safeguard the interests of domestic farmers, strengthen local agriculture through preferential access to such a large market, and mark another powerful step forward in the direction of a self-reliant India," he said.
Both India & US are working to create resilient supply chains for an uninterrupted supply of critical minerals to support industries.#IndiaUSJointStatement pic.twitter.com/urzZFtZF3S— Piyush Goyal (@PiyushGoyal) February 7, 2026
“India is not losing anything in trade deal and even Pakistani voices have openly admitted that India lost nothing but only the Indian opposition spreading fear. Domestic political outrage is not linked from actual economic impact and the opposition is creating anxiety unnecessarily," said Indian government sources.
Pakistani commentators see continuity in India’s trade posture and they also feel it was India’s calculated move without losing anything.

--------------------
Currently, Karnataka is served by 22 Vande Bharat services (11 pairs), operating on both originating and terminating routes, which connect multiple cities across the state. Of these, 14 services either originate from or terminate in the Bengaluru region, highlighting the city’s role as a major rail hub.
The proposed new service will run on the Bengaluru–Mangaluru route and is expected to significantly cut travel time between the state capital and the coastal city.
Addressing a press conference in Bengaluru on Saturday, Union Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the service would be launched once key preparatory work is completed.
“A new Vande Bharat service connecting Bengaluru and Mangaluru will be launched soon after the completion of electrification and safety certifications," Vaishnaw said.
The minister added that Karnataka is witnessing major upgrades in railway infrastructure, noting that a record ₹7,748 crore has been allocated for the state’s rail sector.
The upcoming Vande Bharat Express is expected to be equipped with several advanced safety and comfort features, including:
Once operational, the new Bengaluru–Mangaluru Vande Bharat is expected to modernise rail travel in Karnataka further and improve connectivity between the state’s interior and its coastal belt.

TITLE: IWT Paused, Infra Fast-Tracked, Pakistan Irked: A Look At India’s Projects On Chenab
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/iwt-paused-infra-fast-tracked-pakistan-irked-a-look-at-indias-projects-on-chenab-ws-kl-9888041.html
--------------------
As India placed the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) in abeyance in April 2025 following the Pahalgam attack, it has shifted from a policy of “restraint" to one of “strategic execution".
By treating the treaty as suspended, India is no longer following data-sharing or prior-notification requirements with Pakistan for new or existing projects on the Chenab River.
The IWT is a landmark water-sharing agreement signed on September 19, 1960 between India and Pakistan, brokered by the World Bank. It established a framework for managing and distributing the waters of the Indus River system, which has remained largely functional despite decades of regional conflict.
The treaty divides the six major rivers of the Indus basin into two groups:
Eastern Rivers (Ravi, Beas, Sutlej): Allocated to India for unrestricted use.
Western Rivers (Indus, Jhelum, Chenab): Allocated to Pakistan.
India is permitted limited “non-consumptive" use of these rivers for domestic, agricultural, and run-of-the-river hydroelectric power generation, provided it follows strict design specifications to avoid harming Pakistan’s interests.
It provides for a Permanent Indus Commission (PIC), abilateral body with a commissioner from each country tasked with data exchange, annual meetings, and initial conflict resolution. In case of disputes, it has a three-tiered mechanism starting with the PIC, followed by a Neutral Expert for technical issues, and finally an ad-hoc Court of Arbitration for major disputes.
As India held the IWT in abeyance, it has halted meetings of the Permanent Indus Commission and fast-tracked projects on western rivers (like Ratle and Pakal Dul) without the previously required technical notifications to Pakistan.
It has also rejected rulings from the Court of Arbitration, which India currently labels as “illegal."
Sawalkote HEP (1,856 MW): This is the first major new project to receive a “green light" post-IWT halt. On February 5, 2026, NHPC invited international tenders worth ₹5,129 crore for its construction. It has been designated a “Project of National Importance" and will be the largest in J&K once completed (estimated 9-year timeline).
Dulhasti Stage-II (260 MW): Approved by a Ministry of Environment panel in December 2025. This project is an extension of the existing Stage-I and was cleared specifically under the logic that IWT notification requirements are currently void.
Pakal Dul HEP (1,000 MW): Being fast-tracked for a “non-negotiable" commissioning deadline of December 2026. Crucially, this is India’s first storage project on a western river, giving it the ability to regulate water flow timing into Pakistan.
Kiru (624 MW) & Kwar (540 MW): Both are run-of-the-river projects being accelerated. Kiru is targeted for December 2026, while Kwar is now set for March 2028.
Ratle HEP (850 MW): Long-contested by Pakistan, this project’s construction is now being treated as a sovereign decision. It is being fast-tracked for a 2028 completion.
India has initiated desilting and reservoir enhancement at the Salal and Baglihar projects to improve storage and power generation, activities previously restricted by the treaty.
Since the halt, India has reportedly restricted or fluctuated water flows from existing dams like Baglihar and Salal. In May 2025, downstream flows at Pakistan’s Marala headworks reportedly dropped by up to 90% during maintenance operations.
In June 2025, India initiated a feasibility study for a 113-km canal to divert surplus water from the Chenab basin in J&K toward the Ravi and Beas systems in Punjab and Rajasthan.

--------------------
A top Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) source has confirmed that actor-turned-politician and party chief Vijay is likely to contest from two seats in the Tamil Nadu 2026 assembly elections.
According to the sources, Vijay has finalised Virugambakkam constituency in Chennai as his electoral battleground. The actor-turned-politician is also expected to file his nomination from Trichy East, signaling a strategic push to expand his party’s presence across key urban and regional strongholds.
The confirmation comes amid widespread speculation about the actor’s political debut at the state level.
Earlier, Vijay stated that his party, the TVK, has emerged as a major political force with the backing of the people and claimed it is the only party capable of defeating the DMK in the upcoming elections.
Vijay dismissed speculations of a triangular or multi-cornered contest, stating that the true electoral battle would be a straight fight between the TVK and the ruling DMK, which he confidently predicted would face defeat.
“People talk about triangular or four-corner contests. One is represented by the TVK backed by the people, the second is DMK, and the third is BJP and its many allies. Only the TVK, which is a people’s force alone can defeat the DMK," he added.

TITLE: BJP's Devyani Rana Slams J&K Budget In Maiden Assembly Speech, Yet Wins NC Applause
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/bjps-devyani-rana-slams-jk-budget-in-maiden-assembly-speech-yet-wins-nc-applause-9887959.html
--------------------
BJP MLA Devyani Rana made a strong impression in her maiden speech in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly on Saturday, launching a pointed critique of the Union Territory’s budget while drawing rare applause from members of the ruling National Conference (NC).
As Rana rose to speak on the budget presented by Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, NC legislators were seen thumping their desks in encouragement, a gesture that was repeated at the end of her address, despite her sharp criticism of the government’s financial priorities.
Ahead of the speech, Speaker Abdul Rahim Rather urged members to support the first-time legislator, who won the recent by-election from Nagrota following the death of her father, senior political leader Davinder Singh Rana.
Davinder Singh Rana, once a prominent NC leader and close associate of Omar Abdullah, had joined the BJP a few years ago, a move the chief minister has publicly described as one of his biggest political regrets.
Following Rana’s death after the October 2024 Assembly elections, Abdullah had delivered an emotional tribute in the House, recalling their long association.
Reflecting this personal history, the NC had mounted only a symbolic contest against Devyani Rana in the Nagrota by-election, with Abdullah notably refraining from criticising her during campaigning.
On Friday, Abdullah, who also holds the finance portfolio, presented a Rs 1.13 lakh crore budget for Jammu and Kashmir. A day later, the House listened in near silence as Devyani Rana delivered a detailed, data-backed critique of the proposals.
In her 12-minute address, Rana questioned reduced allocations across several critical sectors, including disaster management, education and welfare schemes.
She highlighted that funding for disaster management and relief had been cut to Rs 350.76 crore from Rs 719 crore in the previous year.
She argued that such a reduction was particularly troubling in light of recent natural disasters.
“This contraction comes in a year marked by unprecedented and relentless rainfall that caused severe destruction, especially in rural areas like Nagrota," Rana said, recalling the flash floods, landslides and cloudbursts that hit Jammu and Kashmir last August and September, claiming dozens of lives and leaving hundreds of families homeless.
More than 100 pilgrims were killed in landslides during the Vaishno Devi and Machail Yatra in Kishtwar.
Rana called for enhanced investment in disaster mitigation and relief, saying it should have been a central focus of the budget. She also criticised cuts in the education sector, warning of their long-term social impact.
“If we spend Rs 193 crore less on education than last year, schools will be shut or merged. How will the child of a poor family move ahead?" she asked.
The BJP legislator further flagged gaps in welfare implementation, citing the free bus service for persons with disabilities, which she said lacked vehicles equipped with disabled-friendly infrastructure.
Despite her pointed attack on the government’s budget and policies, Rana concluded her speech to applause from both treasury and opposition benches, an unusual moment of bipartisan appreciation in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly.
