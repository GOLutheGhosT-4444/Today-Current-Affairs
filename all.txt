In a major administrative action, the Punjab government led by Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party leader Bhagwant Mann suspended two senior IAS officers with immediate effect on Saturday (February 7, 2026).
According to official orders, officers Kamal Kishore Yadav and Jaspreet Singh have been suspended.
Although the reasons for their suspension were not specified in the orders, sources said that it stemmed from a six-year delay in procuring smartphones for Anganwadi workers under the Union Government's Mission Saksham Anganwadi.
The vendor selected by the government for providing smartphones had approached the court for the delay, they further said.
Two additional IAS officers are said to have been transferred in connection with this matter, including Vikas Pratap, who was serving as the Additional Chief Secretary for Social Security.
IAS officer Yadav, a 2003-batch IAS officer, was the administrative secretary of the Department of Industries and Commerce, Investment Promotion and Promotion of Information Technology.
Jaspreet Singh, a 2014-batch IAS officer, is the managing director of the Punjab Information and Communication Technology Corporation Limited.
Both officers have been suspended under Rule 3 (1) of the All India Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1969. During the suspension period, they will remain in Chandigarh, as stated in the orders.
Meanwhile, IAS officer Gurkirat Kirpal Singh has been assigned the responsibilities for Industries, Investment Promotion, and Social Security. Singh had been without a posting for the past 11 months.
This is not the first instance of an IAS officer being suspended during the AAP regime. In February 2025, the State government suspended the then Muktsar Deputy Commissioner Rajesh Tripathi following "serious complaints of corruption."
Additionally, in August 2023, senior IAS officers D.K. Tiwari and Gurpreet Singh Khaira were suspended for making a "technically flawed" decision regarding the dissolution of panchayats.

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K.Stalin on Sunday (February 8, 2026) wrote  to Prime Minister Narendra Modi detailing the status of land acquisition for Railway projects in Tamil Nadu and sought his intervention for their speedy execution. He called for timely release of funds for land acquisition and the revival of projects placed in abeyance.
Mr. Stalin said he was constrained to write the letter in the light of some “factually incorrect information” being spread in the media in this regard. In Tamil Nadu, administrative sanctions have been accorded for land acquisition to an extent of 2500.61.06 hectares of land for implementation of various Railway Projects. Of this, Railways have not sanctioned funds for an extent of 931.52.96 hectares of land.
Administrative sanction for land acquisition in respect of two projects for which revised Land Plan Schedule (LPS) was received recently from Railways for an extent of 296.02.95 hectares of private lands are under process and will be issued shortly. Of the balance extent of 1273.05.15 hectares of land pertaining to 19 major ongoing Railway projects, land acquisition have been completed for an extent of 1198.02.34 hectares of lands (94%) and the same have been handed over to the Railways. However, in respect of five projects, the LPS is yet to be furnished by the Railways, the Chief Minister said.
Land acquisition have been fully completed in respect of major Railway Projects such as Tindivanam-Nagari Broad Gauge Line (BGL), Madurai-Thoothukudi BGL, Maniyachi-Nagercoil BGL, Kanniyakumari-Nagercoil doubling of BGL, Nagercoil-Eraniel doubling of BGL, Thoothukudi-Madurai (via Aruppukkottai) new BGL (Phase-I), Chinnasalem-Kallakurichi new BGL, Mayiladuthurai-Tiruvarur BGL, four junction point in Pattukkottai, new BGL (Salem-Karur track formation), Mannargudi-Needamangalam BGL, Chennai Beach-Korukkupet 3/4th line, and Villupuram-Dindigul BGL. For remaining projects, the land acquisition is being carried out expeditiously, the Chief Minister said.
“I wish to highlight that timely payment of compensation to landowners is an essential prerequisite for completing the land acquisition process. Regrettably, delays in the release of funds by the Ministry of Railways, often in piecemeal manner for individual projects have severely hampered progress. This has led to disruptions, prolonged uncertainty for affected landowners and delays in project execution,” Mr. Stalin said.
A pertinent example is the pending acquisition of 16.86.51 hectares for the doubling of Broad-Gauge Railway Line between Thiruvananthapuram–Kanniyakumari project. The Railways is yet to allocate the required funds amounting to ₹ 289.78 crore for settling compensation. This is a major project in Tamil Nadu, also under monitoring through the PMG portal of the Government of India. A lumpsum and timely allocation of funds for land acquisition, rather than piecemeal releases, would enable uninterrupted and expeditious completion of these critical Projects, he said.
According to him, the State government has accorded highest priority to railway projects and established a robust monitoring mechanism. The Chief Secretary and the Transport Secretary regularly convene monthly coordination meetings with Railway officials to resolve implementation bottlenecks and expedite land acquisition for pending projects, he said.
“At this juncture, I would also like to express concern over the relatively limited allocation of new railway projects to Tamil Nadu in recent years. As the second-largest economy in the country and a major hub for manufacturing and industrial growth, Tamil Nadu continues to make substantial contributions to national GDP and exports. The State possesses immense potential to further bolster the nation’s economic progress through enhanced rail connectivity and infrastructure,” he said.
He urged the Prime Minister to intervene and direct the Ministry of Railways to release the required funds for sanctioned projects without delay, preferably in full and on a priority basis, to facilitate smooth land acquisition and compensation processes. He called for reconsidering and restarting important projects kept in abeyance by the Railways such as Thoothukudi - Madurai (Via Aruppukottai) new BGL and Tindivanam - Tiruvannamalai BGL (for which administrative sanctions has already been issued for acquisition of 931.52.96 hectares) and provide necessary funding support.
The State government was fully committed to extending cooperation for the speedy execution of railway projects, he assured.

Tamil Nadu has been identified as one of the top three States in the country, which suffer from heavy losses incurred by State Public Sector Enterprises (SPSEs).
For the year 2022-23, the top three States in this category were Uttar Pradesh (₹32,430 crore), Rajasthan (₹18,814 crore), and Tamil Nadu (₹16,048 crore), according to the volume 1 of the main report of the 16th Finance Commission. These States come under the broad group of non-north-eastern and hilly (non-NEH) States.
As in the case of other non-NEH States, a substantial portion of the losses were concentrated in the power sector. In the year in question, the now-defunct Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) had recorded a loss of about ₹9,192 crore. However, for 2024-25, the recently published Annual Integrated Rating of the Distribution Companies, compiled by the Power Finance Corporation, put the profit after tax (PAT) of the Tamil Nadu Power Distribution Corporation Limited (TNPDCL), one of the successors of the Tangedco, at ₹2,073 crore.
But this had become possible due to the State government’s largesse — the provision of tariff subsidy of ₹15,772 crore and the takeover of loss of ₹16,107 crore. More significantly, the accumulated deficit of the TNPDCL went down to ₹1,19,153 crore in 2024-25 from ₹1,66,944 crore of the Tangedco in 2023-24., thanks to the unbundling of the latter.
Describing the poor financial performance of SPSEs as “a burden on State budgets,” the Finance Commission stated that the State governments had to incur budgetary expenditure in the form of subsidies, grants, equity investments, and loans. Besides, they had to provide guarantees against the loans raised by the SPSEs. The financial support extended by State Governments to SPSEs in the form of equity, loans, and grants/subsidies through the budget during the year 2022-23 amounted to ₹2.5 lakh crore.
The Commission recorded that for 2022-23, the budgetary out go of the Tamil Nadu government to the SPSEs was ₹26,867 crore and till the end of the year in question, the outstanding guarantees stood at ₹89,768 crore.
The Commission did not include Tamil Nadu in the club of States with a high proportion of loss-making enterprises, a matter that provides solace to policy makers and people of the State.

A mysterious gas leak from a cylinder at a scrap dealer’s shop triggered panic in a locality near the Jammu airport on Saturday (February 7, 2026), prompting authorities to rush joint teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) to the scene, officials said.
Several residents of Rani Bagh complained of breathlessness following the sudden leakage of gas from an abandoned cylinder lying at the scrap dealer’s premises, they added.
According to authorities, teams of the NDRF and SDRF, wearing protective gear, along with police and fire and emergency department personnel, reached the scene and successfully contained the leak.
They assured that the situation is well under control and there is no need to panic.
An investigation has been initiated to determine the nature of the gas and how the cylinder ended up at the scrap dealer’s shop, officials noted, adding that the substance will be identified through scientific analysis, and further action will be taken accordingly.
However, officials did not rule out the possibility that the gas could be a hazardous chemical, including sulphur mustard.

Minister for Water Resources and Katpadi MLA Duraimurgan inaugurated a 25-ft high memorial pillar at Mordhana Dam.
T.N. Minister for Water Resources and Katpadi MLA Duraimurgan on Saturday inaugurated a 25-ft high memorial pillar at Mordhana dam, which was built across the Koundinya river, a tributary of the Palar, in Gudiyatham town in Vellore to commemorate 25 years of the existence of the dam that helped to irrigate 8, 367 acres of farmland in the region.
Officials of the Water Resources Department (WRD), which maintains the dam, said that the foundation stone was laid more than three decades ago in December, 1990. when Mr. Duraimurugan was the Minister for Public Works and Forests. A decade later, the dam was inaugurated by former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi in September 2000. “The dam reached its full storage capacity of 261.3 mcft for the tenth time during the 2025 monsoon. The dam also witnessed restoration works during that period,” V. Kalipriyan, Assistant Engineer (AE), WRD (Gudiyatham), told The Hindu.
Accompanied by Collector V.R. Subbulaxmi and Vellore MP D.M. Kathir Anand, Mr. Duraimurugan inspected the canal, protection wall and bund area. “Water from the dam is a lifeline for irrigation and domestic use. It helps to cultivate crops for at least three seasons a year,” said G. Ramu, a farmer.WRD officials said that the restored left canal of the dam runs 31.84 kms distance, covering at least 19 villages with around 1,710.92 hectares of farmland.
The left canal, which is three metres wide, covers a large tract of land under cultivation. Water from the Koundinya river directly irrigates around 140 acres. Another 220 acres in the region are irrigated through water from the left canal of the dam alone. WRD officials said that under the Rehabilitation and Restoration of Lakes scheme 2024-25, the left canal of the dam was taken up for restoration where deposited silt on the canal bed was removed to a depth of three metres to ensure steady water flow on it. Growth of thick vegetation especially on bund and slope of the bund was also removed.
WRD officials said that restoration of the key canal of the dam has helped for storage of excess rainwater in the dam to its full capacity during the 2025 monsoon since 2021 massive floods in the region. Excess water from the dam also overflows to 19 irrigation tanks on the downstream of the river, thereby providing adequate water for farmers in the area for cultivation. On the occasion, S. Pavalakannan, Superintending Engineer (SE), WRD, R. Venkatesh, Executive Engineer (EE), WRD, P. Gopi, Assistant Executive Engineer (AEE), WRD, and S. Ramkumar, AE (WRD) were present.

--------------------
The State government has  earmarked an amount of ₹30 crore in the Budget for ensuring continued treatment facilities for those suffering from Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA).
The government’s interventions in the area of rare diseases began in 2022 with the launch of an SMA pilot project at SAT Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram. The initiative began with the free distribution of Evrysdi – a medication which cost about ₹5.2 lakh – to SMA-afflicted children up to five years of age. In 2023, the coverage was expanded to include children up to seven years of age, according to Cure SMA, a SMA patient collective.
The Kerala United Against  Rare Diseases (KARE) scheme was introduced  in 2024 and  treatment support was further extended to children up to 12 years of age. At present, 110 children across the State are beneficiaries of the programme.
The government is also providing Scoliosis surgery free of cost through the Government Medical College Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram, to correct the spinal curvature
Cure SMA has welcomed the budgetary allocation made by the government for SMA care as it is a great support for parents struggling to ensure the survival and quality of life of  their SMA-afflicted children

--------------------
After years of uncertainty, recent steps by the Central and State governments on the Angamaly-Sabari rail project have rekindled hopes among people along the proposed corridor, despite a section of them sharing fears triggered by bitter experience from the past.
Officials claimed that the project, which remained stalled for over 25 years due to multiple hurdles, had entered the right track, with the State government announcing that it would bear 50% of the cost, including land acquisition expenses, and the Railway Ministry de-freezing the project.
Thousands of families, whose land parcels remain earmarked for the 110-km railway line covering parts of Ernakulam, Idukki and Kottayam districts, hope that with the latest steps their land will be acquired by the government, and that they will be paid due compensation without further delay.
“Unlike earlier, I’m a bit hopeful now,” M.P. Viswanathan Nair, an ex-NRI with an earmarked property in Okkal panchayat, said. He said that the Central and State governments coming together for the project had increased his confidence. He added that he had not been able to sell or mortgage his land ever since it was earmarked for the project. “Those around me who share my fate are also by and large hopeful now, though there are doubts over how much progress will be made before the Assembly elections,” he said.
Salim N.A. of Okkal shared the sentiments. “I’m hopeful too, but I will become confident only once the land acquisition offices are opened,” he said.
Sivan Kizhakkekara from Muvattupuzha, however, sounded pessimistic, though. He termed the latest developments an election stunt. He said even if land acquisition works resumed, he would demand compensation for the physical and mental agony caused by the 25-year delay.
Meanwhile, the Sabari Rail Central Action Council demanded speedy action to acquire land for the project and pay compensation to the affected landowners.
A total of 152 hectares will have to be acquired for the project in Ernakulam as per the revised land acquisition proposal, district officials said. They added that the procedures for land acquisition would resume once the Revenue department issued a notification, which was expected within a week.
The district authorities have also submitted proposals to open two more land acquisition offices, besides the existing one with bare minimum facilities. A total of 55 posts have been proposed for the three offices, officials said.

DMK president and Chief Minister M.K. Stalin said on Saturday that Tamil Nadu should give “zero”-seat tally to the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the Assembly election as the BJP-led Union government had given “zero” to Tamil Nadu in the Union Budget and did not fulfil the genuine demands of the State.
Addressing the South Zone DMK Youth Wing conference near here, Mr. Stalin said Tamil Nadu had been the ‘numero uno’ State in the country in all departments during the last five-year rule of the DMK. “It has been ranked number one in the Union government’s ratings and also by national and international magazines. Tamil Nadu’s progress has no parallel,” he said.
However, Tamil Nadu has got nothing in the Union Budget, belying the anticipation that the poll-bound State would get some benefits from the Union government. Mr. Stalin said all that Tamil Nadu demanded was more funds for disaster management, Metro Rail, drinking water schemes, and railway projects, permission for the new airport in Hosur, 50% devolution of Central funds to the State, exemption from NEET, expedited construction of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Madurai, and the promise of not reducing the number of Lok Sabha seats under delimitation. But nothing has been granted by the Union government. “They gave us zero. The BJP-led NDA should be given zero in the Assembly election, similar to what they got in the 2024 Lok Sabha election,” Mr. Stalin said.
He ridiculed AIADMK general secretary Edappadi K. Palaniswami for claiming that he was the head of the NDA in the State. However, the BJP has made the AIADMK a branch of the national party, and he was not raising his voice in the interest of Tamil Nadu, he alleged.
Mr. Stalin also criticised the AIADMK’s proposed protest against the DMK for preventing the Viksit Bharat-Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB-G RAM G) scheme.
“Does Mr. Palaniswami even know the name of this new scheme? The Union government did not give [funds for providing] jobs even for 50 days when the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme guaranteed jobs for 100 days. How will the Union government ensure that the jobs are given for 125 days as promised, this when the States have been made to contribute 40% of the funds [towards the scheme]?” he asked.
The BJP that has tasted only defeat in the State and the AIADMK, which has seen multiple defeats, should not only be defeated again in the upcoming Assembly election but also with a bigger margin to make the State more progressive, the Chief Minister added.

While the Karnataka government claims that no government school has been closed in the State, two sources of official data indicate that as many as 3,617 government schools were shut down  between 2020-21 and 2025-26.
Data tabled by the Union Ministry of Education in the Rajya Sabha on February 4, in response to a question raised by a CPI(M) member John Brittas regarding school closures across the country, shows that 947 government schools shut down between 2020-21 and 2024-25. It came down from 49,791 in 2020-21 to 48,844 in 2024-25.
Further, an October 15, 2025, order by the Department of School Education and Literacy (DSEL), Karnataka, on establishing Karnataka Public Schools, pegs the number of government schools in the State at 46,174, indicating a drastic decline. Data for 2025-26, which saw the largest closures, pegged at 2,670, is not part of the data tabled in the Rajya Sabha.
DSEL Minister Madhu Bangarappa had earlier claimed in the Karnataka Legislature session that no government school had been permanently closed in 2025-26, but only temporarily shut.
The enrolment of students in government schools in the State has declined from 47.1 lakh in 2015-16 to 38.2 lakh in 2025-26, recording a decline of 19%. The share of government schools in the total enrolment has declined from 46% to 38%.
During the same period, enrolment in private unaided schools increased from 36.3 lakh to 47 lakh, recording an increase of 29%. The number of government schools with an enrolment of 50 or less students has increased to 25,683 in 2025-26. This trend clearly indicates why government schools were shutting down year on year.
However, data tabled by the Union Ministry of Education in the Rajya Sabha shows that even the number of private unaided schools have decreased in Karnataka — from 19,915 in 2020-21 to 19,105 in 2024-25. Data for 2025-26 is not available in the public domain.
Private schools that have not been renewed for Recognition Renewal (RR) are included in the closed schools list, sources said, explaining the anomaly, but also indicating the mushrooming of schools without regulation.
“This year, about 98% of private schools in the State have not renewed their RRs. In addition, schools that have not appointed qualified teachers under the RTE Act and those that have not obtained the religious and linguistic minority certificate from National Commission for Minorities, will not be renewed,” explained developmental educationist V.P. Niranjanaradhya.
“Education is on the concurrent list. Unless a State gets substantial funds from the Union government, none can improve public education. But, year on year, allocation for education from the Union government is declining. Whatever the funds are released, they put a lot of conditions in the name of PM Shree schools, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan. Unless you comply with the National Education Policy (NEP-2020), funds are not released. RTE is a Central legislation. The share of Central and State funds for the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, which was 90:10 earlier, has now come down to 60:40. This should be reversed,” he said.

--------------------
Tejasvi Surya
Amidst a political slugfest over who is responsible for the Namma Metro fare hike, at least two BJP leaders from the city on Saturday claimed that the Union government had intervened and put the proposed fare hike on hold at their behest. Tejasvi Surya, MP for Bengaluru South, and Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly R. Ashok claimed the revised fares will not come into effect from February 9, as was scheduled.
However, Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL) told The Hindu that they had received no such communication. “We can decide only when official communication comes to us. So far, we have not received any communication,” a senior BMRCL official said.
This has created confusion whether the new fares will come into effect from Monday or not.
Mr. Surya and Mr. Ashok on Saturday claimed to have spoken to Union Minister of Power and Housing and Urban Affairs Manohar Lal Khattar flagging the issue and that he had directed officials to put the implementation of the revised fares on hold.
Mr. Surya claimed that Mr. Khattar assured a review of anomalies in the Fare Fixation Committee’s (FFC) recommendations and indicated that a fresh FFC could be considered if the State government submits a formal request. Soon after Mr. Surya’s claim, Mr. Ashok claimed in a post shared on X that he too had a chat with Mr. Khattar and the Minister had made similar assurances.
Both the leaders put the ball in the State government’s court. “It is now up to the State government to act in the interest of the people. The Congress government led by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah must immediately abandon its rigid and insensitive approach and initiate the process of forming a new Fare Fixation Committee (FFC),” Mr. Ashok said.
Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had, in a statement issued on Friday, put the onus on the Union government to fix Namma Metro fares and the State was bound to implement the fares recommended by the FFC, an independent committee.
Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar claimed the State was not even consulted on fare revision. Contradictin this, Mr. Surya claimed it was based on letters from the State that the FFC was formed. Union Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy alleged that the State government was trying to mislead people and the Centre’s share in BMRCL was only 20%.
The BMRCL had, on Thursday, announced a zone-wise fare revision under its Annual Automatic Fare Revision mechanism, with the revised fares scheduled to take effect from February 9. The new structure involves a marginal increase of ₹1 to ₹5 across 10 fare zones, with fares recalibrated based on distance slabs across the Namma Metro network.
The announcement triggered strong backlash from commuters, as it came on the back of last year’s sharp fare hike. On February 9, 2025, BMRCL implemented a steep fare increase, with some slabs witnessing hikes of over 100%, leading to widespread protests across Bengaluru. Following public outrage, BMRCL later said the anomaly was due to technical issues in the fare calculation and capped the hike at 71% from February 14, 2025.
As commuter anger resurfaced after Thursday’s announcement, the issue soon turned into a political slugfest between the BJP and the Congress, with both sides trying to blame the other over the fare hike.

In a big reform, the State government has introduced auto-conversion of land use in the notified Master Plan area within the Greater Bengaluru Authority (GBA) area. Now, one can directly apply for a plan approval as per the Master Plan, and conversion will be done as part of the process automatically. A new software to facilitate the same was launched by Revenue Minister Krishna Byre Gowda on Saturday.
“With the enabling provision of auto conversion, GBA now has the legal framework to convert B-Khata properties into A-Khata,” Mr. Byre Gowda said, adding that this will help lakhs of property owners who have purchased unauthorised sites in the past. Getting A Khatha will add legal strength to such sites, enable them to obtain loans, increase the value of their property, ease transactions, and approvals.
GBA is now running a one-time scheme to issue A-Khata to B-Khata properties, if the site owner pays 5% of the guidance value. Deputy Chief Minister and Bengaluru Development Minister D.K. Shivakumar recently said that the GBA had received 1.2 lakh applications, of which 45,000 had been rejected.
Earlier, even lands falling within the Master Plan required separate conversion, despite the concept of “deemed conversion.” This process typically took 4 to 6 months and often led to delays, harassment, corruption, and increased costs due to middlemen, Mr. Byre Gowda himself acknowledged.
“The auto conversion of land is intended to help legal, faster, and easier development of land. Thus, help common people to buy affordable sites. Ease of governance and compliance is hoped to reduce the cost and time of land development. This will benefit not only residential development, but is also available to industrial and other uses as permitted in the Master Plan. With this reform, the Revenue Department is hoping to plug bad governance and corruption at the source itself,” he said.
“By bringing online transparent time-bound and automatic processes, discretion is reduced. All these steps, along with E-Khata and integration of different records, will reduce litigation and bring greater guarantee to property ownership,” he further said.

TITLE: Karnataka High Court confirms death penalty for three men in gang rape and murder of minor

--------------------
The High Court of Karnataka has confirmed the death sentence for three men convicted of the gang rape and murder of an eight-year-old girl at a tile factory in Mangaluru, declaring the 2021 crime as a “rarest of rare” cases.
A Division Bench comprising Justice H.P. Sandesh and Justice Venkatesh Naik T. in its February 4 verdict has dismissed the appeals of the convicts, identified as Jayban Adivasi and Mukesh Singh, both natives of Madhya Pradesh, and Manish Thirki, a native of Jharkhand, and upheld the capital punishment awarded by a Mangaluru special court for cases registered under the provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, in November 2024.
The incident occurred on November 21, 2021, on the premises of the tile factory where both the victim’s parents, who are natives of Jharkhand, and the accused persons worked.
The Bench found sufficient evidence to establish that the men, in a premeditated conspiracy, lured the child with sweets, took her to a secluded room on the tile factory premises, and subjected her to sequential rape and assault. And when she cried out due to bleeding injuries, Jayban Adivasi smothered her to death. Three of them then concealed her body in a drainage, the Bench noted.
The Bench affirmed the conviction by analysing a chain of circumstantial evidence, statements of eyewitnesses who had seen the victim girl with the three accused, conclusive DNA evidence linking the men to the crime, recovery of blood-stained clothing, and CCTV camera footage. The Bench noted the presence of chewed food particles in the victim’s teeth, corroborating the prosecution’s claim that she was lured with sweets.
Assessing the materials on record, the Bench said that “there are no mitigating circumstances favouring the accused to reduce the sentence, since it is a gangrape of a minor girl, who was aged about 7 years and 7 months at the time of commission of the offence”.
“If a lesser sentence is imposed, it will give a wrong message to society and the public at large, and this act of subjecting the minor girl to satisfy their lust would be encouraged as such act has to be curbed with iron hands,” the Bench observed.
The trial against another man, Munim Singh, a resident of Madhya Pradesh, who is arraigned as accused number-4 in the case, is pending as he absconded after obtaining bail from Mangaluru court before trial began.

Union Minister for Railways Ashwini Vaishnaw on Saturday said that electrification work on the Hassan–Mangaluru section is currently under way, paving the way for the launch of the Bengaluru–Mangaluru Vande Bharat train service. Once electrification is completed, train services will be introduced on the Karwar–Mangaluru–Bengaluru route, significantly improving rail connectivity to Karnataka’s coastal region.
Addressing a press conference at the BJP office in Bengaluru, Mr. Vaishnaw said, “Karnataka is witnessing major railway modernisation. This includes the redevelopment of 51 Amrit Bharat railway stations at an estimated cost of ₹2,110 crore, alongside the operation of 12 Vande Bharat trains in the State”.
Referring to projects announced in the Union Budget recently, the Minister said that the proposed high-speed rail corridors connecting Bengaluru with Chennai and Hyderabad would enhance connectivity among three of South India’s key economic centres. “Once operational, the travel time between Bengaluru and Chennai is expected to reduce to 73 minutes, while the Bengaluru–Hyderabad journey would take around two hours,” he said.
On the long-pending Bengaluru suburban railway project, Mr. Vaishnaw said that the work on all four phases is progressing. Dedicated suburban tracks will be built alongside existing railway lines, and a new design framework has been finalised to expedite execution of the project.

--------------------
World-class cancer care facilities will be available under one roof in central Kerala with the commissioning of the new building complex of the Cochin Cancer Research Centre (CCRC), constructed at a cost of ₹449 crore.
Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will inaugurate the facility on Monday. Health Minister Veena George and Industries Minister P. Rajeeve will be present on the occasion.
The CCRC will be a valuable addition to the cancer care landscape of Kerala, which already boasts two major premier cancer care institutions in the public sector—the RCC in Thiruvananthapuram and MCC in Thalassery.
The CCRC will provide advanced and high-quality cancer care, marking a significant milestone in Kerala’s efforts to establish the best of cancer treatment and research in the State. The facility will be a source of great relief to hundreds of cancer patients in central Kerala who would not have to travel far to access care.
The CCRC has been developed on 12.63 acres within the Kalamassery Medical College campus, comprising nine buildings with a total built-up area of 6.3 lakh square feet.
The new building complex has 16 elevators, sophisticated and modern operation theatres, and parking facilities for 550 vehicles. It houses 12 fully equipped operation theatres designed for complex surgeries, including one reserved exclusively for future robotic surgical procedures.
The CCRC will also place a huge thrust on cancer research in the State, with a 10,000 square feet area allocated exclusively for research activities.
The new complex is equipped with sophisticated facilities for scanning, X-ray, radiation therapy, and other critical services, integrated with AI-led technologies.
It is the first hospital building in Kerala to receive EDGE certification. All current power requirements of the building will be met through solar energy, making it a green building that is 25% carbon-neutral. It also hopes to attain full carbon neutrality by 2050, aligning with the State government’s aspirations for the same.

--------------------
Concerns have been raised over the government’s move to reduce the number of working days of government offices to five a week. It is feared that the decision would make it harder for the public to access administrative services.
National Janata Dal district leader K.U. Irshad described the move irrational. He warned that it could trigger public resentment at a time when people were already forced to make repeated visits to offices even for minor matters.
He said that in institutions such as village offices, panchayats, taluk offices and collectorates, people often have to wait for days to complete procedures related to certificates, land records, welfare scheme applications and pension processing.
The situation in courts is also worrying, he said, pointing to a large backlog of cases, including many that have been pending for years in consumer and family courts.
“When procedures cannot be completed on time even with six working days a week, reducing working days will only push people into greater hardship,” said Mr. Irshad.
He noted that despite the widespread introduction of digital services, problems such as delays in file movement, unnecessary procedural complexities and unequal access to services continued to persist.
Any move to cut working days would send a wrong message to society, he said. “Priority should instead be given to improving the quality and efficiency of public services,” he said. Mr. Irshad demanded that the government reconsider its decision.

BJP president Nitin Nabin on Saturday (February 7, 2026) said the Union Budget 2026 has brought substantial gains to Kerala, with a sharp increase in the State’s tax devolution and Central grants, besides major allocations for infrastructure and railway development.
He was speaking at a discussion on the Union Budget organised by BJP Intellectual Cell here. Mr. Nabin said Kerala has received special consideration in railway development, including the allocation of Vande Bharat and Amrit Bharat trains.
On Kerala’s development, Mr. Nabin said the Union government is guided by Deendayal Upadhyaya’s philosophy of Antyodaya, which focusses on serving the last person in society. Benefits for agricultural sectors such as cashew and cocoa would reach Kerala, he said.
He said Kerala’s share in tax devolution has increased by 33%, amounting to around ₹8,973 crore, while Central grants doubled from ₹13,000 crore to ₹26,000 crore.
“The Centre shows no parsimony when it comes to development of Kerala,” he asserted.
Highlighting welfare schemes, Mr. Nabin said 1.55 crore beneficiaries in Kerala are covered under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana, 85 lakh people have Ayushman Bharat cards, 28 lakh farmers benefit from PM-Kisan, and over 10,000 Jan Aushadhi centres are functioning in the State. He also said the Centre is strengthening coastal shipping and inland waterways, which would provide economic support to the coastal State.
Mr. Nabin said the Prime Minister’s efforts to revive cultural centres such as Kashi and Ujjain have boosted tourism significantly, and similar support for Kerala’s heritage would energise the local economy. He reaffirmed the BJP’s commitment to protecting Kerala’s cultural heritage, including the sanctity of Sabarimala.
Expressing concern over radicalism, Mr. Nabin said Kerala is passing through a difficult phase that has impacted local businesses. A secure environment is essential for business growth, and the BJP would not compromise on national security, he said.
Drawing a parallel with Bihar’s improved business climate under the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), he said the BJP aims to transform Kerala into an investor-friendly State. “Under Narendra Modi’s leadership, I assure you that a BJP government will be formed in Kerala in 2026,” he said, adding that the party is committed to building a developed Kerala as part of a developed India by 2047.
State president Rajeev Chandrasekhar, State general secretaries A.S. Suresh and Shobha Surendran, along with other party leaders and representatives from various walks of life, participated in the programme.

in the face of poor implementation of the plan and inability to offer basic infrastructure at the location of resettlement, the J&K government has decided that “58 existing hamlets within the Dal Lake will be developed as ‘eco-hamlets’.” File

The Jammu and Kashmir government has abandoned the ₹416.72-crore resettlement plan for Dal Lake dwellers. To a question from National Conference (NC) legislator Tanvir Sadiq, it told the J&K Assembly that the project achieved “only 27% progress” in 17 years.
The plan was conceived by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress leader Sonia Gandhi to preserve and restore the lake, which attracts tourists from across the globe. The Singh government approved the plan in 2009.
The project sought to relocate and rehabilitate around 9,000 families from the Dal Lake ecosystem to tackle growing pollution, mitigate impact on aquatic life and preserve the shrinking lake.
However, in the face of poor implementation of the plan and inability to offer basic infrastructure at the location of resettlement, the J&K government has decided that “58 existing hamlets within the Dal Lake will be developed as ‘eco-hamlets’.”
“Work on six hamlets has already been taken up under the UT Capex budget, with one – Kachri Mohalla – already completed as a modern village,” the J&K government told the Assembly.
According to the new plan, an in-situ conservation model will replace the old scheme, and “residents will be allowed to stay in ‘eco-hamlets’ developed within the water body”.
The shift in the policy has come in the wake of a report submitted by a high-level committee, headed by the Divisional Commissioner of Kashmir, last year. It described the Dal Lake dwellers as an “integral part of the lake ecosystem”. The committee called for the continued stay of these dwellers on the lake, while also stating that it was “equally important to keep it [the lake] vibrant, dynamic and lively”.
The government claimed that a sewerage network for six hamlets had been laid, and detailed project reports for modular sewage treatment plants were under preparation. A ₹212.38-crore project, named ‘Integrated Management Programme for conservation of Dal-Nigeen Lake ecosystem’, had been accepted in principle by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, it said.
The five-year project aimed to address sewerage in 28 internal hamlets, treat inflow from catchment areas and dredge interior channels, the reply stated, adding that it awaited the final approval from the Finance Department.
Under the ManmohanSingh government’s plan, 7,526 kanals of land were acquired at Bemina in the outskirts of Srinagar, and the colony was named Rakh-e-Arth Resettlement Colony. Each Dal Lake dweller was issued a land plot, ₹1.05 lakh for structure and ₹3.91 lakh as one-time compensation. However, the project re-settled only 1,808 families of around 9,000 Dal lake families, officials said.

Chandrababu Naidu and Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Science and Technology Jitendra Singh laying the foundation stone for Amaravati Quantum Valley, at Uddandarayunipalem in the capital region on Saturday. Union Minister P. Chandra Sekhar and IT Minister N. Lokesh are seen.
Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu on Saturday described the laying of the foundation for the Amaravati Quantum Valley (AQV) as a historic moment not only for the State but also for the country, asserting that the initiative would place India at the forefront of global quantum revolution.
The foundation stone for the first integrated quantum valley ecosystem was laid by Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Science and Technology Jitendra Singh and Mr. Naidu, at Uddandarayunipalem in Amaravati, where Quantum Valley Towers would be built in 50 acres.
Addressing the gathering on the occasion, Mr. Naidu said, “It marks more than the construction of buildings, as it also symbolises the creation of a strong base of global talent that will drive the quantum transition in the decades to come.”
Noting that the United Nations had declared 2025 as the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology (IYQ), Mr. Naidu said quantum technology would become a critical pillar as technological capabilities expanded worldwide.
While India had missed the agricultural and industrial revolutions, it had successfully embraced the IT revolution, he observed.
Comparing it with the Hitec City in Hyderabad, which then was a game-changer, the Chief Minister asserted that Amaravati would be developed on similar lines as a global hub for quantum technology.
Mr. Naidu said the AQV would emerge as a centre for quantum designs, products and intellectual property, with research spanning defence, healthcare, energy, finance and climate modelling. He expressed the confidence that global discourse would soon shift from Silicon Valley in the U.S. to Quantum Valley in Amaravati.
Highlighting the unique land pooling model adopted for building the capital city, with farmers as key stakeholders, the Chief Minister thanked the IBM, TCS and L&T for partnering with the State government to establish India’s first 133-qubit quantum computer centre.
Mr. Jitendra Singh, in his address, lauded Mr. Naidu’s long-term vision. “The Chief Minister has planned for technologies that will shape the future decades in advance,” he said. The Union government had launched the National Quantum Mission with an allocation of ₹6,000 crore to position India as a global technology leader, he added.
“Amaravati will become a hub not only for quantum computers but also for quantum professionals, with advanced research in defence, healthcare and finance,” he said, adding that B.Tech courses in quantum studies were already underway and M.Tech programmes would be launched soon.

TITLE: Modi Govt Kicks Off Mega Dam Project On Chenab After Pausing Indus Treaty With Pakistan | Exclusive
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/modi-govt-kicks-off-mega-dam-project-on-chenab-after-pausing-indus-treaty-with-pakistan-exclusive-9887566.html
--------------------
India has started work on the mega Rs 5,129 crore worth Sawalkote Hydroelectric Project on the River Chenab in Jammu and Kashmir—the first such new project to get the green light from the Narendra Modi government after the abrogation of the Indus Water Treaty.
News18 has accessed the documents of the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) Limited inviting companies on February 5 to build this mega project in the Udhampur and Ramban districts of Jammu and Kashmir. The Sawalkote Hydroelectric Project, which in Stage One will see a 1,406 MW project coming up and a 450 MW project in Stage Two, is located on the Chenab River between the Baglihar Project to its upstream and the Salal Project to its downstream. This will be a “run of the river" project.
“Construction methodology and selection of equipment have been planned with the aim to commission the project as early as possible," reveal the documents accessed by News18, showing the urgency. Acting swiftly on projects of strategic significance following the suspension of the Indus Water Treaty, an expert committee of the environment ministry cleared the 1,856 MW project last October. Now, NHPC has invited bids to build it.
The documents say that the major construction works shall start after necessary initial mobilisation. “Available working season in a year in the project area shall be 12 months for all underground works & for surface works with full progress rate during non-monsoon period and with 50% progress rate in monsoon period."
The project could take 9 years to complete, as per the documents.
News18 reported last month that the Centre has issued firm directions to fast-track four major hydropower projects on the Chenab river system. Officials had been asked to commission the Pakal Dul and Kiru projects by December 2026, complete the Kwar project by March 2028, and accelerate construction on the strategically sensitive Ratle Dam.
The most consequential of the projects is the Pakal Dul hydropower project in Kishtwar. At 1,000 MW, it is the largest project in the Chenab basin and, at 167 metres, the highest dam in India. Crucially, it is India’s first storage project on a western river that flows into Pakistan. Built on a tributary of the Chenab, the project was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in May 2018.
With the Indus Waters Treaty effectively in abeyance, the Centre has now ordered that Pakal Dul be commissioned by December 2026. Once operational, it will give India the ability not just to generate power but to regulate the timing of water flows—a capability Pakistan has long viewed with concern.
Running parallel is the Kiru project, also located in the Kishtwar district. The Kiru Dam, rising 135 metres on the Chenab, is a run-of-the-river project, but its strategic value lies in how it fits into a chain of projects upstream and downstream.
The Centre has set the same December 2026 deadline for Kiru, making it clear that both projects are expected to come online together.
The third pillar of this push is the Kwar project, another run-of-the-river dam on the Chenab with a height of 109 metres. A major engineering milestone was achieved in January 2024 when the Chenab was successfully diverted to enable construction. That diversion was closely tracked in Pakistan. The Centre has now directed that Kwar be commissioned by March 2028, locking in a firm timeline.
Then there is the Ratle project, perhaps the most contentious of them all. The 850 MW project involves a 133-metre-high dam on the Chenab and has been opposed by Pakistan for years, particularly over the design of its spillways. During his recent visit, the Power Minister laid the foundation stone for the dam’s concreting works, signalling that Ratle is now being fast-tracked. The Chenab was diverted through tunnels for this project in 2024, and the dam is expected to be ready by 2028.
Beyond these headline projects, India is also moving ahead with Dulhasti Stage-2 on the Chenab. The project received clearance from the Environment Ministry’s panel last December and will come up after Dulhasti-I, which is already operational. Pakistan has recently objected to this clearance as well, arguing it was not informed—an objection India has rejected.
The Chenab is part of the Indus basin—Pakistan’s lifeline. Nearly three-fourths of Pakistan’s water originates from the western rivers that flow from India into Pakistan. Over 90 per cent of Pakistan’s agriculture depends on this basin, and almost the entire network of its dams and canals is built around it. In effect, nine out of ten Pakistanis rely on water that first flows through Indian territory.
India has skipped all Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) proceedings following the Pahalgam attack.

TITLE: India Could Be One Of The Best Choices For Legal Migration To Europe: Greek Defence Minister
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/india-could-be-one-of-the-best-choices-for-legal-migration-to-europe-greek-defence-minister-9887619.html
--------------------
Greek Defence Minister Nikos Dendias on Saturday said India and the wider Indian subcontinent could become among Europe’s most viable partners for legal migration, as the continent grapples with an ageing population and shrinking workforce.
Speaking at the India-EU Forum 2026 in New Delhi, Dendias described migration as a long-standing global reality and stressed the need for Europe to design structured and balanced migration pathways to address its demographic challenges.
“Migration is a global phenomenon. It existed in the past and will continue in the future," he said, adding that Europe’s population growth is “almost negative," creating an urgent demand for younger workers.
Against this backdrop, he noted that the Indian subcontinent’s demographic profile makes it a strong candidate for legal migration partnerships.
“With its current population structure, the subcontinent could be one of the best choices for legal migration," Dendias said, while noting that such frameworks must be carefully designed to ensure mutual benefits for both countries of origin and destination.
The Greek minister also flagged concerns over illegal migration, calling it a destabilising challenge fuelled by organised human smuggling networks.
He urged stronger international cooperation to counter what he described as a large-scale, profit-driven criminal activity.
Beyond migration, Dendias reflected on the historical and cultural links between Greece and India, referencing Alexander the Great’s expedition to the region.
He described India as an enduring presence in Greek mythology and suggested that contemporary cooperation offers an opportunity to renew and deepen bilateral ties.
The inaugural India-EU Forum, organised by the Ministry of External Affairs in partnership with the Ananta Centre, concluded on Saturday after two days of discussions on trade, security, technology and geopolitics.
Held from February 6 to 7, the Track 1.5 forum brought together more than 200 policymakers, industry leaders and strategic experts from India and European Union member states.
External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar delivered the opening address on February 6, while Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal participated in a special session the same day. Nikos Dendias addressed a dedicated fireside chat on February 7.

TITLE: ‘Didn't Mean To Insult': MP Minister Apologises Again For Remarks On Col Sofiya Qureshi
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/didnt-mean-to-insult-mp-minister-apologises-again-for-remarks-on-col-sofiya-qureshi-9887409.html
--------------------
Madhya Pradesh Tribal Affairs Minister Kunwar Vijay Shah has offered another apology for his objectionable remarks against Colonel Sofiya Qureshi amid a Supreme Court-mandated deadline for his prosecution, saying he did not intend to insult a woman officer.
In May last year, Shah sparked a political row for his remarks against Col Qureshi, who became one of the most prominent faces of media briefings when India launched Operation Sindoor against terror hideouts in Pakistan. In a viral video, Shah was seen referring to the woman army officer as a “sister of terrorists".
His remarks were widely criticised by political leaders, and an FIR was filed against him. Speaking to reporters on Saturday, Shah said he had never intended to insult a woman officer, the armed forces or any section of society.
“I have said this many times earlier, and I am reiterating it today that I did not intend to insult any woman officer, the Indian Army or any section of society," he was quoted as saying by NDTV, adding that his remarks were made in a “moment of patriotic excitement".
“It is extremely painful for me that such a controversy arose due to a small error on my part. I believe my feelings will be seen in the right context. I have always had immense respect for the Indian Army and will continue to do so," he added.
Shah said maintaining “decorum and sensitivity of words" was extremely important in the public and vowed to exercise control over his speech in the future. The Madhya Pradesh High Court had ordered the police to file an FIR against him last year for the controversial remarks.
Supreme Court Raps MP Govt For Delay
On January 19, the Supreme Court pulled up the Madhya Pradesh government to he delay in granting permission to prosecute Shah for his remarks. The bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) Surya Kant, Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Joymalya Bagchi directed the state government to take a call on the grant of sanction to prosecute Shah.
“You are sitting over the SIT report since August 19, 2025. The statute casts an obligation on you and you must take a call. It is January 19 now," CJI Kant remarked.
On July 28, 2025, the top court had pulled up Shah for not placing a public apology over his remarks on record against Col Qureshi, saying he was “testing the court’s patience". It had pointed out that the minister’s conduct was prompting it to doubt his intentions and bonafide.
The FIR was registered against Shah under sections 152, 196(1)(b) and 197(1)(c) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS). Since the top court’s view last month, the Congress has demanded Shah’s resignation from the Madhya Pradesh cabinet.

TITLE: 'If Intent Is Pure...': Piyush Goyal Credits PM Modi's 'Masterclass' For India-US Trade Deal
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/if-intent-is-pure-piyush-goyal-credits-pm-modis-masterclass-for-india-us-deal-ws-l-9887017.html
--------------------
Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal on Saturday credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “masterclass" and US President Donald Trump’s leadership in securing a landmark India-US trade deal, emphasising that the two countries share a good relationship and mutual respect.
Speaking in an exclusive interview with CNN-News18, Goyal said it was PM Modi and Trump’s leadership that gave impetus to the trade deal and helped smooth engagement between the two sides. “If your intent is pure, if you believe in fair play on both sides and respect each other’s sensitivities, and are committed to the well-being of your nation while recognising strengths, it leads to mutual understanding," he said.
He called the deal a powerful “win-win" arrangement for both countries to strengthen trade engagement. “When we look at the $30 trillion US economy and the $4 trillion Indian economy that is rapidly growing to become a $30 trillion economy in 2047, we both collectively provide a force multiplier, which helps us achieve the target of $500 billion purchases in five years," he said.
His remarks came after an interim deal between India and the US was announced on Saturday, culminating months of negotiations amid tariff-related tensions. The deal provides for a reduction in reciprocal US tariffs on Indian goods to 18 per cent.
PM Modi’s ‘Masterclass’
Goyal further lauded PM Modi, calling him a “pragmatic leader" who recognises India’s comparative strengths and the sensitive areas, such as farmers and fishermen. “This unique and clear understanding of PM Modi has helped us navigate the whole process," he added.
He compared PM Modi to a “masterclass" who is very practical and offers real-life solutions. “Over the last 12 years of working with him, we have all actually grown in terms of our understanding of principles of negotiation, and our understanding of how to look at the best interests of your nation. Most important is his holistic thinking," he told CNN-News18.
The Commerce Minister said India’s focus is on acquiring ICT products, data centres and quantum computing equipment from the US to become an international player in modern-day technological areas.
India-US Ties
He also asserted that India shares a good relationship with the United States, who respected each other’s sensitive areas. He also rejected criticism that the deal could affect Indian farmers, adding that several Indian exports are facing zero tariffs.
He also said he foresaw no problems with the US in the future, citing the friendly relations between the two sides and the fact that teams had finalised all matters after months of negotiations. “We are not that much apart in terms of our abilities to conclude a good deal. We are not competitors, we complement each other. We respect each other’s sensitivities. Both leaders guided teams," he added.
He said India was already self-sufficient in rice, wheat, sugar, soyabean, corn, GM products, poultry, millets, certain fruits and green peas, groundnuts and non-alcoholic beverages. These products that were sensitive for the farmers and were protected under the new deal. “On other products, there has been a calibrated opening. In many cases, there has been some phasing out over a period of time and tariff rate quotas have been given."
Goyal expressed confidence that the trade deal could generate several opportunities for collaboration between the two countries.

TITLE: Prescription For Crises: Govt May Ask Pharma Firms To Fund Free Medicines For Emergencies
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/prescription-for-crises-govt-may-ask-pharma-firms-to-fund-free-medicines-for-emergencies-9885630.html
--------------------
India is examining a proposal to mandate pharmaceutical companies to set aside a share of their profits for free medicines during health emergencies, News18 learned.
The proposal seeks an amendment to the Drugs Rules, 1945, to include a mandatory provision requiring pharmaceutical companies to spend “at least one per cent of their net profit for providing free medicines in medicine bank" to be used by the central government during “health emergencies, disaster or any other circumstances considered necessary".
The proposal is still under deliberation and has been placed before the country’s top statutory decision-making body on technical matters related to drugs and cosmetics, the Drugs Technical Advisory Board.
The move, according to the agenda document accessed by News18, is being examined to assess whether emergency access to free medicines can be strengthened through regulatory changes without conflicting with company law.
The proposal was deliberated at DTAB’s 90th meeting held on January 25, 2024, after which the board recommended that the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare may seek the opinion of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs on the matter.
Subsequently, comments were received from the corporate affairs ministry, which flagged legal constraints. The agenda document notes that “the broad framework for CSR is laid down under Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013", along with Schedule VII of the Act and the Companies (CSR Policy) Rules, 2014.
It further clarifies that “the Government does not issue specific direction or intervention in the manner or geographical area in which companies choose to spend their CSR funds", highlighting limits on directing CSR expenditure through sector-specific rules.
The corporate affairs ministry has indicated that any attempt to mandate CSR-linked spending through drug regulations would need to be legally aligned with company law. The document states that “CSR is governed by Companies Act, 2013," and therefore suggests that “the authority for CSR activity may be quoted from Schedule VII, Companies Act, 2013 and Companies (CSR Policy) Rules, 2014 and proposed amendment in Drugs Rules, 1945 need to be in sync".
More significantly, it cautions that “any amendment in the CSR framework would require an amendment to the Companies Act", suggesting that changes through the Drugs Rules alone may not be sufficient.
The matter has now been placed back before DTAB, with the agenda concluding that “DTAB may kindly deliberate and give its recommendations in the matter".
The matter continues to be reviewed, with regulators weighing public health needs against existing corporate law provisions.

India clinched the U-19 World Cup title for a record-extending sixth time after defeating England by 100 runs in the final held in Harare, Zimbabwe.
With this win, India strengthened their position as the most successful team in the history of the U-19 World Cup.
A major highlight of the final was opener Vaibhav Sooryavanshi, who delivered a brilliant performance on the biggest stage of his young career. The teenage batter scored a stunning century, reaching the milestone in just 55 balls and playing a key role in India’s dominant win.
The 14-year-old Sooryavanshi smashed a record 80-ball 175, an innings comprising an astonishing 15 fours and 15 sixes as India also broke the record for the highest total ever in a U19 World Cup final. His innings is also the highest individual score in a summit clash of the tournament.

TITLE: Rent Promises, Red Flags & Runaway Dues: Saket Court Seeks Police Report On '32nd Milestone' Project Promoters
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/rent-promises-red-flags-runaway-dues-saket-court-seeks-police-report-on-32nd-milestone-project-promoters-9885011.html
--------------------
What began as a promise of guaranteed rentals and glossy commercial returns has now landed the promoters of Gurugram’s “32nd Milestone" project in a Delhi courtroom, with a magistrate seeking a detailed police response to allegations of cheating, fund diversion, and large-scale financial irregularities.
A Judicial Magistrate First Class at Saket Courts has issued notice on an application seeking registration of an FIR and a slew of stringent measures against the promoters and entities behind the commercial project, including freezing of bank accounts, a forensic audit of finances, suspension of passports, and issuance of Look Out Circulars. The order was passed on February 5 by JMFC Devanshi Janmeja, directing the police to file an Action Taken Report (ATR). The matter is scheduled for further hearing on March 13.
The application has been moved by investor Arvind Gupta, who has accused the promoters of financial misconduct, cheating, and siphoning of investors’ funds. Action has been sought against M/s 32nd Vistas Private Limited, Growth Hospitality LLP, and their promoters, including Dhruv Dutt Sharma, Shirin Sharma, Mamta Sharma, and others.
According to the complaint, the investor had purchased a commercial unit in the project after being assured that the unit would be demarcated shortly. The promoters allegedly offered guaranteed lease rentals for a period of 30 years, along with a buyback option at any stage if the investor chose to exit. A leasing arrangement was subsequently executed, under which the unit was placed on a long-term lease with assurances of regular monthly rental income.
However, the complaint alleges that lease rental payments stopped from August 2025 onwards. It further claims that the promoters failed to deposit Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) from September 2024 and defaulted on GST dues, statutory filings, and employee-related contributions such as ESI and PF, allegedly causing losses to investors, employees, and the public exchequer.
The complainant has alleged that investors were repeatedly told that rental payments and TDS deposits had already been credited but were not reflecting due to “technical issues", claims that later turned out to be false. It is further alleged that fabricated TDS certificates were circulated among investors to create the impression that statutory deposits had been made, despite no such entries appearing in official records.
When the investor sought demarcation and possession of the purchased unit or invoked the buyback option, the promoters allegedly expressed their inability to hand over possession. The application suggests that one possible reason could be multiple sales of the same commercial units.
Serious allegations of diversion and siphoning of funds have also been raised. The plea claims that despite earning rental income from operational restaurants and commercial establishments at the project, the promoters failed to clear dues owed to investors, employees, financial institutions, and statutory authorities. It is also alleged that substantial borrowings were raised from banks and private investors and were misused.
The application further states that protests have been taking place outside the project premises, offices have allegedly been shut, and essential utilities such as electricity and water supply disconnected due to non-payment of dues, while the promoters are claimed to be untraceable.
Concerns have also been raised regarding alleged expenditure on promotional campaigns and high-profile endorsements. The plea refers to associations involving public figures such as Malaika Arora, Abhay Deol, Karan Johar, Manish Malhotra, and Akshay Kumar, and seeks investigation into the financial trail of such promotional spending at a time when investor dues allegedly remain unpaid. No allegations have been levelled against these celebrities, and the plea confines itself to examining the source of funds used for such promotions.
On these grounds, the application seeks registration of an FIR, attachment of assets, forensic audit of accounts, suspension of passports of the promoters, and issuance of Look Out Circulars to prevent them from leaving the country.
Taking note of the allegations, the Saket court has directed the police to submit a detailed status report and listed the matter for further consideration on March 13.
The company has said in a statement that recent delays in rental payments have been driven by a short-term vacancy in a limited portion of its Gurugram property, arising from normal tenant churn and a change in tenancy, and that “replacement leasing is already underway and being prioritised".
Notably, the legal action in Delhi follows recent FIRs registered by Gurugram Police against the owner and certain officials associated with “32nd Avenue", the popular retail and entertainment hub, after investor protests.

LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/in-rare-move-delhi-police-book-ips-officer-others-over-illegal-detention-unauthorised-raids-9884615.html
--------------------
Delhi Police’s vigilance unit has registered a case following an internal inquiry into a November 2023 police operation carried out in Mizoram. The case was registered after an inquiry concluded that there was prima facie material suggesting procedural and jurisdictional irregularities during the operation.
According to the FIR, the case has been filed under Sections 166, 341, 342, and 409 of the Indian Penal Code to allow a formal criminal investigation into the conduct of officers involved against IPS Shankar Choudhary, a 2011 batch officer, along with others.
The inquiry examined a cross-state police action conducted between November 21 and 30 in 2023 by a Delhi Police team in Mizoram in connection with a narcotics investigation. The FIR records that the team stayed and conducted operations outside Delhi’s territorial jurisdiction and that questions were later raised by Mizoram authorities about authorisation and custody procedures.
The document talks about an unauthorised stay and operations without lawful written orders from a competent authority.
The inquiry reviewed CCTV footage, travel records, PCR logs, and witness accounts to reconstruct the events.
According to the FIR, the vigilance inquiry found sufficient preliminary material to justify criminal registration, so the matter could be independently investigated.
“These observations constitute prima facie material for registration of a case to enable fair and independent investigation," the report states. “The purpose of the present registration is to enable a fair and independent investigation into the circumstances of the operation."
The FIR names IPS officer Shankar Choudhary as part of the raiding team whose conduct is under review.
The document records, “Shankar Choudhary IPS… was part of the raiding team which stayed and conducted operations in Mizoram during the period under inquiry."
On authorisation, the inquiry notes, “The officer stayed in Mizoram and continued operational activity without obtaining written permission from the competent authority."
The report also raises concerns over detention procedures: “Illegal detention… demonstrates that Harrison House premises were taken under control and individuals were confined without lawful authority."
Investigators further recorded, “No proper documentation of seizure, custody or inter-state coordination was found at the time of inquiry."
According to the FIR, the Delhi Police officials only provided assistance in conducting the raid under the bona fide impression that the Mizoram Police team, led by a senior police officer who earlier served as DCP/Dwarka, was carrying out the investigation legally.
“The onus was on Mizoram Police to comply with the procedural safeguard, prepare all necessary documentation related to search, seizure and arrest/detention including case diaries," the FIR says.
It further states that the role of Delhi Police officials was limited to making an entry whenever the staff moved with Mizoram Police and a detainee was brought to the police station or Anti-Narcotic Squad of Dwarka/South West.
“Upon holistic examination of the facts, evidence, and testimonies, the following findings emerge: Shankar Choudhary, IPS, acted beyond his legal and territorial authority. He conducted unauthorised raids and seizures within Delhi, violating legal and administrative protocols. He kept a suspect, Harrison, in illegal custody for four days at Mizoram House. He failed to document seized property, thereby violating legal, procedural and evidentiary norms. Delhi Police Officials (HC Shalju, HC Vikash, HC Prashant) accompanied the officer and participated in raids without requisite sanction. Their actions, while irregular, do not establish mens rea or criminal culpability but warrant departmental action," the report says.
Recommendations were made to book Shankar Choudhary for abusing authority, wrongful confinement, and misappropriation of seized property.

--------------------
External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Friday told the Parliament that the Indian government is closely monitoring the ongoing situation in Iran after a wave of protests triggered by economic stagnation, and its embassy in Tehran was in regular touch with Indian nationals.
“The Government is closely monitoring the situation in Iran. The Embassy of India in Tehran is in regular contact with Indian nationals, including students, in Iran, and is providing them regular advice," he said in the Parliament. “The Embassy continues to assist, advise, and guide Indian citizens as required."
“The Government does not currently view Indian nationals in Iran as stranded, given that Iranian airspace remains open and there is regular air connectivity between Iran and India and with the countries in the region. A special evacuation has therefore not been arranged by the Government so far. The Government continues to assess the situation as circumstances evolve," he also said.
He also informed the House that there were 9,000-10,000 Indian nationals across 16 provinces in Iran, mainly students (and their families), workers, pilgrims, tourists, business persons and seafarers. “Since Iranian airspace remains open as on date, Indian nationals wishing to leave Iran have been advised to do so using available means, including commercial flights," he said.
He also highlighted a telephonic conversation with his Iranian counterpart Abbas Araghchi, where they discussed the evolving situation in and around Iran. He also reaffirmed that India remains in touch with various interlocutors regarding the situation.
This came against the backdrop of the Iranian authorities’ deadly response to anti-government protests that began in late December and continued through last month, in which thousands of people were killed and tens of thousands arrested, prompting military threats from US President Donald Trump.

Recently, in the Budget 2026 unveiled on February 1, India earmarked zero funds for the Chabahar port in Iran despite the landmark 10-year agreement signed in 2024 for India to operate the Shahid Beheshti terminal. Analysts suggest this withdrawal is a precautionary response to the renewed geopolitical friction involving the United States.
Furthermore, Trump has also asserted that India will buy Venezuelan oil instead of Iranian crude, signalling a possible shift in global energy trade flows. However, India said it will prioritise its own energy needs and remains open to all crude deals.

--------------------
In a major institutional reform aimed at transforming urban mobility in the national capital, the Delhi government has initiated the process of drafting a comprehensive Bill for the creation of the Delhi Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (DUMTA) along with a dedicated Delhi Urban Transport Fund (DUTF).
The proposed legislation seeks to rationalise, integrate and coordinate Delhi’s presently fragmented transport ecosystem under a single, coherent planning and governance framework.
The move marks a significant milestone in the government’s vision to create a modern, efficient, people-centric and environmentally sustainable transport system for the Capital.
To fast-track and ensure inclusive drafting of the proposed law, the Chief Minister has set up a high-level task force chaired by the Chief Secretary to prepare and submit the draft Bill at the earliest. The move reflects the government’s urgency and responds to long-standing demands from experts and civic stakeholders for a unified transport authority to coordinate planning, investment and operations, a press statement said.
Recognising that Delhi’s rapid urbanisation, rising population and mounting vehicular pressure demands systemic solutions rather than piecemeal interventions, the Chief Minister has taken a proactive step by setting the legislative process in motion.
The task force includes senior officials from key departments and representatives of major civic and transport bodies such as DDA, MCD, DMRC, DTC, NCRTC and Indian Railways. The Chief Minister has also proposed co-opting leading urban transport experts to integrate global best practices with local needs.
Explaining the rationale behind the initiative, Chief Minister Rekha Gupta noted that Delhi’s transport agencies have historically functioned in silos, with limited coordination in route planning, infrastructure development and service delivery.
“DUMTA will bring cohesion to Delhi’s entire urban mobility system. By placing all modes of transport like metro, buses, regional rail, railways and feeder services, within a single planning jurisdiction, we will ensure that mobility solutions are integrated, efficient and citizen-focused," the CM said.

India is moving to formally define ‘biological drugs’ under its medicines law, as the category expands with the launch of some of the world’s top-selling therapies, including anti-obesity and diabetes blockbuster semaglutide, News18 learnt.
The move comes as drug regulators grapple with fast-evolving manufacturing technologies that blur the lines between synthetic medicines and biologically derived products, often produced within the same facility. The Drugs Technical Advisory Board (DTAB) is now set to deliberate on a proposal that seeks to introduce a legal definition of biological products, mandate origin-based labelling, and update legacy schedules under the Drugs Rules, 1945, to reflect modern biologics.
The matter has now been formally placed before the apex drug approval panel, Drugs Technical Advisory Board, with the agenda document concluding that “DTAB may kindly deliberate and give its recommendation in the matter."
If approved, industry experts believe the changes would mark a significant overhaul of India’s biological drug regulation, bringing long-overdue legal clarity at a time when biologics and peptide-based therapies are rapidly reshaping the pharmaceutical landscape. The move is also significant considering India itself is planning to become hub of biological and biosimilar drug making with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announcing the “BioShakti Pharma Hub" scheme in the union budget last Sunday.
According to the agenda document accessed by News18, the proposal has been triggered by a growing number of applications received by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation, where manufacturers are seeking regulatory approval to produce both synthetic and recombinant products at the same site. The document said that “CDSCO receives multiple applications wherein manufacturers seek permission to manufacture synthetic and r-DNA origin drug products in the same manufacturing facility."
Regulatory agency in the document noted that this convergence has become especially prominent in peptide-based therapies. “Certain peptide-based therapeutic products, such as Semaglutide and similar products are available in both synthetic and r-DNA origin and in injectable as well as oral dosage forms," the agenda paper says, underlining the regulatory complexity such products pose.
While the existing framework allows limited flexibility, the regulator acknowledges that the rules lack clarity on core definitions. “Schedule M of the Drugs Rules, 1945 provides provision for campaign-based manufacturing with appropriate cleaning validation and risk mitigation measures," the document said but adds that “the substantive provisions of the Drugs Rules do not define ‘Biological drugs’."
The absence of a formal definition has also created uncertainty around licensing, particularly when different categories of drugs are produced at the same location. The agenda paper flags that “currently, there are no provisions on licensing overlap between facilities licensed under Form 28 and Form 28D at the same site," raising concerns about regulatory oversight, inspections and compliance.
To address these gaps, the proposal recommends incorporating a definition of “biological products" into both the Drugs Rules and the New Drugs and Clinical Trials (NDCT) Rules, 2019. Citing global standards, it reproduces the World Health Organization’s definition, describing biological products as “a product containing a substance produced by or extracted from biological sources, such as living cells or organisms, and which require complex manufacturing processes and control."
The document further clarifies that “biological products include vaccines, blood and blood components, allergenic, somatic cells gene therapies, tissues, recombinant therapeutic proteins and monoclonal antibodies."
In a move aimed at improving transparency, the regulator has also proposed mandatory origin-based labelling. The agenda note states that “mandatory labelling provisions may be introduced to clearly indicate the origin of the drug as ‘Synthetic Origin,’ ‘r-DNA Origin,’ ‘Human Origin,’ or ‘Animal Origin,’ as applicable."
Additionally, the proposal calls for “consequential amendments" to Schedule C and Schedule C1 of the Drugs Rules, 1945, to explicitly include biological-origin products in both parenteral and non-parenteral forms, reflecting the growing diversity of modern biological therapies.

TITLE: NIA Raids Government Medical College Anantnag Linked To 'White Collar' Terror Module
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/nia-raids-government-medical-college-anantnag-linked-to-white-collar-terror-module-ws-l-9884205.html
--------------------
The National Investigation Agency (NIA) conducted a search operation at the Government Medical College in Anantnag district of Jammu and Kashmir on Friday. This was in connection with the “white collar" terror module that was dismantled in November last year.
According to officials, the NIA team arrived at GMC Anantnag to carry out the searches related to the recovery of a rifle found in a doctor’s locker in November of the previous year. Dr. Adeel Ahmad Rather was one of the nine individuals arrested during the investigation into the terror module, which also led to the discovery of a significant amount of explosives in Faridabad, NCR.
In a parallel development, security forces continued their search operations in the Koil Karewa area of Pulwama district. Officials stated that the operation was initiated following intelligence reports about the presence of terrorists in the region. No arrests or significant recoveries have been made so far in this ongoing operation.
One Terrorist Killed In J-K’s Kishtwar
Earlier this week, a suspected Pakistani terrorist was killed in an operation in the snow-bound higher reaches of Jammu and Kashmir’s Kishtwar district. The operation took place on Wednesday.
“In the continuing search and elimination of terrorists in the Kishtwar region, where the hunt has already led to several contacts in the dense forests and challenging terrain, a contact was re-established with the terrorists on the run in the ongoing joint operation (Trashi-I), by the troops of Counter-Insurgency Force Delta, White Knight Corps, J&K Police and CRPF at around 5:45 pm today in the general area of Dichhar, Kishtwar. One terrorist has been successfully neutralised. Operation is in progress," Army’s White Knight Corps said in a post on X.

TITLE: 'Ego-Driven Killing': How Overseas Gangsters Orchestrated AAP Leader's ‘Remote Control’ Murder
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/ego-driven-killing-how-overseas-gangsters-orchestrated-aap-leaders-remote-control-murder-ws-l-9884114.html
--------------------
The killing of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Lucky Oberoi has once again exposed the growing challenge posed by overseas-based criminal networks directing violence in Punjab from thousands of kilometres away. CCTV visuals showed a hooded assailant shooting Oberoi at close range before fleeing the scene on a scooter, pointing to a well-planned execution rather than a spontaneous act.
Top intelligence sources have told CNN-News18 that the murder was allegedly orchestrated by Jograj Singh, also known as Joga Pholriwal — a known gangster originally from the Jalandhar–Phulriwal belt — who is currently believed to be operating from either the United States or Canada. According to security agencies, the killing did not stem from a deep political conspiracy but was triggered by pride, online provocation, and the unchecked influence of criminals operating from abroad.
Intelligence sources allege that a minor altercation between Oberoi and Jograj Singh escalated over social media in the days leading up to the murder. Investigators claim the online exchanges were not random and played a direct role in provoking the attack. “This was a classic case of ego-driven violence amplified through digital platforms," a source claimed.
Sources further revealed that Jograj Singh began his criminal journey as a small-time offender involved in intimidation, assault, and extortion-related activities in Punjab. Mounting pressure from law enforcement eventually forced him to flee the country. Once abroad, distance provided him a degree of immunity, allowing him to operate with greater confidence and reduced fear of immediate arrest.
Security agencies have described the killing as a “remote control murder" — an emerging pattern in Punjab’s crime landscape. According to Punjab Police and central intelligence agencies, overseas handlers no longer pull the trigger themselves. Instead, they use encrypted messaging apps, social media provocations, and digital payments to recruit and motivate local foot soldiers to carry out violent acts.
Jograj Singh is also said to be associated with Sonu Khatri, another gangster based overseas. Intelligence sources suggest that Khatri functions less as a street-level criminal and more as a network facilitator. Agencies believe his role includes connecting overseas gangsters with local shooters, arranging logistics, and routing money through informal channels to finance murders.
The Oberoi killing, intelligence sources warn, underscores a dangerous trend where digital reach and transnational criminal networks are turning minor disputes into deadly outcomes, posing a growing challenge for Indian law enforcement agencies.

--------------------
The Karnataka government on Thursday gave its approval to use ballot papers and ballot boxes for upcoming panchayat elections. The decision clears the way for changes in the law ahead of the Panchayat polls.
Speaking about the same, State Minister HK Patil said that the approved Karnataka Gram Swaraj and Panchayat Raj (Amendment) Bill, 2026, will allow elections to be conducted using traditional voting methods instead of electronic machines.
Patil stated that the existing law does not contain provisions for ballot papers and boxes, and necessary legal changes will now be made wherever required. He confirmed that the forthcoming Panchayat elections will be conducted through this method.
The state government has expressed concerns about the use of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs). It believes public confidence in the machines has declined, prompting the shift to paper ballots.
Last September, the Congress government had already decided to recommend to the State Election Commission that future panchayat and urban local body elections be held through ballot papers rather than EVMs, citing questions raised by people over their credibility.

--------------------
Amid the ongoing woes of Delhi air pollution, the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), a prime construction and maintenance agency of the central government, has procured 405 air purifiers between 2021 and 2025.
As per the official data, the highest number of air purifiers — 156 units — were purchased during the last financial year (2024-25), the Lok Sabha was informed on Thursday.
The data was provided in response to a question asked by TMC MP Mahua Moitra. Union Minister of State for Housing and Urban Affairs Tokhan Sahu informed that the air purifiers were issued to government offices, chambers, VVIP lounges and dining halls of judges and registrars of the Supreme Court of India.
Detailing the use of the device, it was mentioned that the air purifiers were also installed in courtrooms and offices associated with the apex court.
Besides this, the air purifiers were also provided to the offices of ministers, ministries at Nirman Bhawan, Sewa Bhawan, Vigyan Bhawan and key institutional locations such as the Constitution Club of India.
Air purifiers were also issued to the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha secretariats, besides CPWD offices in Jodhpur and Varanasi.
In the written reply, it is clearly mentioned that in 2021-22, the CPWD purchased 24 air purifiers, which rose to 81 units in 2022-23. The numbers then grew in 2023-24 with the procurement of 144 air purifiers, followed by the highest purchase in 2024-25 in the last five years.
The reply included the details of the purchases made through the government’s online procurement portal, which showed air purifiers of Eureka Forbes, Honeywell, Phillips, Dyson and other brands being bought over the four years.
Apart from major construction projects, the CPWD, which comes under the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry, also looks after the maintenance of central government buildings.

--------------------
A motorcyclist was found dead inside a massive pit at a road construction site in West Delhi’s Janakpuri area on Friday morning, triggering allegations of negligence from his family. The deceased was identified as Kamal, a resident of Kailashpuri.
The Delhi government later ordered a probe into the case, Urban Development Minister Ashish Sood confirmed.
Water Minister Parvesh Verma has announced an ex gratia of Rs 10 lakh for the family of the deceased. The Delhi Jal Board has also set up a committee to probe the death of the motorcyclist who allegedly fell into a construction pit dug by the water agency.
According to the relatives of the man, he was returning home late on Thursday from his office in the Rohini area and had remained in touch with family members during the commute.
When he failed to reach home, they began searching for him, visiting several police stations through the night, including those in Janakpuri, Sagarpur, Vikas Puri and Rohini.
Family members said they received a call from the police around 7.30 am informing them about an accident.
When they reached the site, they found Kamal’s body inside the pit along with his motorcycle.

They alleged negligence by the Delhi Jal Board, which was carrying out construction work at the location, and also raised the possibility of foul play, claiming someone might have killed Kamal and dumped his body in the manhole.
Police said all angles were being examined.
Responding to the incident, Delhi Jal Board has expressed “deep sorrow" over the tragic accident that occurred at the pipeline rehabilitation project site in Janakpuri and conveyed its condolences to the bereaved family.
A serious view has been taken of the tragic accident at the Janakpuri Line Rehabilitation Project site.Delhi Jal Board has constituted a high-level Inquiry Committee to ensure a transparent investigation into the incident.

The Board said a committee has been constituted to investigate the incident, and assured that strict action will be taken if negligence is found at any level. It added that regular inspections of safety measures are being carried out at all workplaces. The board has urged citizens to report any unsafe worksite on the toll-free helpline number 1916.
According to news agency PTI, authorities received a call around 7 am about the incident in Janakpuri, following which personnel rushed to the spot.
A senior officer told the agency that preliminary investigations indicated the pit was part of a Delhi Jal Board worksite and that it had been “properly barricaded."
“We are investigating the matter to ascertain the exact sequence of events," the officer was quoted as saying.
DELHI MAN FALLS TO DEATH IN PIT: THE POLICE’S VERSION
According to the Delhi Police, the man worked at the HDFC Bank, and his daily shift usually ended at nearly 11 pm.
On Thursday, as his shift ended, he called his family and informed them that he was at Janakpuri District Centre and was on his way home.
As the police were informed about the family, at nearly 12.30 am, that Kamal had not reached home, a search for him began. Subsequently, the police traced his mobile phone’s location, which was nearly 200 mts away from the accident spot.
The Delhi Police conducted a search operation in the area for nearly two hours during the night, with head constables searching the surroundings for any clues.
Kamal’s body was found in the morning when someone reported that a man and a bike were lying in a pit.
Police reached the spot, and a team from the fire brigade was called.
The body was fished out at nearly 8.30 am.
AAP BLAMES BJP
Saurabh Bharadwaj, Delhi unit chief of the Aam Aadmi Party, shared the pictures of the accident on his official X handle.
In his post, Bharadwaj wrote, “Shocking !!! An innocent biker fell into a deep pothole on the road, got stuck, lay there all night, and died."
“The BJP government in Delhi has learned nothing from the Noida incident. They just keep lying every day," he alleged.
The incident comes weeks after a similar case in Noida, where 27-year-old software engineer Yuvraj Mehta died after his car fell into a waterlogged pit near a construction site.
The incident had happened in Sector 150 area during the intervening night of January 16 and 17.
In the recent case, authorities in Delhi said forensic teams and local officers were reconstructing the sequence of events in Kamal’s case, examining whether safety barricades were intact, checking nearby CCTV footage and recording statements from witnesses and family members.
Officials stressed that no conclusion would be drawn until the probe is completed.

TITLE: A Farmer, A Megaphone And His Radish Harvest Outside A Govt Office In Karnataka

--------------------
On a recent morning in Tumakuru district, visitors to the Madhugiri taluk office were met with an unusual sight. A farmer stood outside the building with a megaphone, speaking calmly but firmly about a problem that, he said, had gone unresolved for months.
Beside him was a scooter loaded not with files or placards, but with freshly harvested radish.
The farmer, Prasanna Kumar from Dodderi Jakkenahalli village, said he has been seeking a proper connecting road to his agricultural land. According to him, the absence of a motorable access road has made it difficult to transport produce and carry out routine farming work.
Prasanna told officials and onlookers that he had repeatedly approached the local administration for help. Over time, the issue moved beyond the village level and reached higher authorities.
Orders Issued, But No Action on Ground
According to Prasanna, the matter was taken up with the Lokayukta, which directed officials to resolve the issue within a month. He also said he approached senior political leaders, including the chief minister and the revenue minister, following which letters were issued asking the local administration to act.
Despite these directions, Prasanna claimed no work had begun even after nearly two months. The lack of progress, he said, pushed him to stage a public protest.
Allegation of Bribe Demand
Standing outside the taluk office, Prasanna alleged that officials linked to the village administration and revenue department demanded money to move the file forward. He accused the village accountant and panchayat-level revenue inspectors of seeking a bribe.
“I don’t have cash to pay," he said through the megaphone, explaining why he chose to bring radish from his field. His message was symbolic: if money was the obstacle, he was willing to offer what he had grown instead.
The Radish Protest Goes Viral
Videos and photographs of the farmer’s protest, radish stacked on a scooter and slogans amplified through a megaphone quickly spread on social media. The visuals drew widespread attention, with many users interpreting the protest as a reflection of frustration with bureaucratic delays and alleged corruption.
Following the online attention, senior officials responded. Gotur Shivappa, assistant commissioner of Madhugiri, said he had instructed the tahsildar to look into the farmer’s complaint on priority.
Officials Deny Bribery Allegations
Revenue officials, however, rejected the farmer’s claims. Srinivas, the current tahsildar of Madhugiri, said the issue was not administrative delay but a family dispute.
According to him, a previous tahsildar had already arranged for an eight-foot-wide road, and an existing asphalted road already provided access to the land. Officials also said they had visited the village and that the remaining disagreement involved relatives and an adjacent plot.
While the farmer maintains that official inaction and alleged bribe demands forced him to protest publicly, authorities insist the road issue has largely been addressed and that the conflict is personal rather than procedural.
With the matter now under scrutiny and senior officials involved, attention has shifted to what action follows and whether the farmer’s access road will finally move from paper to ground.

TITLE: 'People Rejected You': SC Rejects Prashant Kishor-Led Party's Plea Challenging Bihar Elections
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/people-rejected-you-sc-rejects-prashant-kishor-led-partys-plea-challenging-bihar-elections-9883643.html
--------------------
The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed a petition filed by Jan Suraaj, the political party led by poll strategist-turned-politician Prashant Kishor, challenging the outcome of the Bihar Assembly elections held in November last year.
Refusing to entertain the plea, a bench headed by Chief Justice Surya Kant made sharp remarks on the party’s electoral defeat, saying, “The people rejected you and now you are using this judicial platform to gain publicity?"
Justice Joymalya Bagchi also questioned the maintainability of the petition, asking Jan Suraaj’s counsel how such claims could be raised directly before the apex court.
The bench declined to hear the matter under Article 32 and asked the petitioner to approach the Bihar High Court instead.
Jan Suraaj had sought to have the election results declared null and void, alleging large-scale violations of the Model Code of Conduct by the ruling Janata Dal (United)–Bharatiya Janata Party alliance.
The party argued that the state government’s decision to disburse Rs 10,000 to one woman per family during the election period compromised the fairness of the polls.
According to the petition, the benefit was extended to an estimated 25–35 lakh women voters while the Model Code was in force, amounting to “corrupt practices" by the ruling coalition.
Kishor had earlier claimed that the JD(U) distributed crores of rupees per constituency and said the party should not have won more than 25 seats under normal circumstances.
In the election, however, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) emerged as the largest party, winning 85 seats, far exceeding both its 2015 tally and Kishor’s own predictions.
The Supreme Court noted that the broader issue of election freebies is already under its consideration in a separate case.
In earlier observations, the court had warned that competitive promises of financial benefits could push states towards fiscal distress and has referred the issue to a three-judge bench.
On Friday, the court said it was serious about examining the matter but would prefer petitions from “public-spirited" individuals rather than parties that had suffered a complete electoral defeat.
Jan Suraaj’s challenge follows a disappointing electoral debut for the party, which contested 238 seats but failed to win a single constituency, ending with a vote share of under four per cent.
Kishor, who had previously engineered successful campaigns for both the BJP and JD(U), had predicted a decisive outcome for his party, either a major breakthrough or total failure.

--------------------
The Madras High Court on Friday dismissed a petition filed by actor and Tamilaga Vetri Kazhagam (TVK) founder Vijay, who had challenged a Rs 1.5 crore penalty imposed by the Income Tax Department.
Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorty rejected the plea and upheld the demand notice issued by the department. The penalty relates to the assessment year 2015–16 and concerns alleged non-disclosure of income.
According to the tax authorities, documents seized during a 2015 search at Vijay’s residence indicated that he had not declared Rs 15 crore earned from the film Puli. Based on these findings, the department issued an order on June 30, 2022 imposing the penalty.
Vijay, however, maintained that he had declared an income of Rs 35.42 crore for the financial year 2016–17 and challenged the department’s action in court.
A single judge had earlier admitted his petition on August 16, 2022 and granted interim relief by staying the operation of the penalty order.
With Friday’s ruling, the High Court has now dismissed his challenge and allowed the tax department’s action to stand.
Vijay argued that the penalty order ought to have been issued before June 30, 2019 and claimed that the delay made it invalid. The Income Tax Department, however, maintained that the action was lawful under the provisions of the Income Tax Act and urged the court to reject his petition.
After considering both sides, the court agreed with the department’s stand and dismissed Vijay’s plea.

Parliament Budget Session Highlights: The Lok Sabha has been adjourned after witnessing a ruckus by the Opposition leaders on Friday. The MPs of the opposition walked out of the lower house and staged a protest against the government over the India-US trade deal.
Earlier on Thursday, the Lok Sabha was adjourned amid the ruckus by the opposition.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke on the Motion of Thanks on the President’s address in the Rajya Sabha. He also attacked Congress leader and Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi over a controversial “traitor” remark made against BJP MP Ravneet Singh Bittu, calling it an insult to the Sikh community and a reflection of Congress’ “arrogance at its peak.
“What happened yesterday — the ‘Yuvraj’ of Congress, who has a ‘shaatir dimaag’ called a member of this House a traitor. His arrogance is at its peak. He did not call others who left Congress traitors, but he said it to this MP because he is a Sikh. This is an insult to Sikhs, an insult to the Gurus. This shows the hatred Congress carries,” PM Modi said.

Raj Sabha proceedings began at 2 AM.
BJP MP PP Chaudhary criticised the Congress over disruptions during the ongoing session, saying the party lacked facts and ideology. He urged the Opposition to adopt a constructive role in Parliament instead of what he called a destructive approach.
“The way the Congress disrupted the House in this session, they have no facts and ideology… The Congress should take a constructive approach, but it has a destructive one,” he said.
Rajya Sabha has been adjourned till 2 PM.
Opposition MPs are holding protest against the government at the Makar Dwar of the Parliament.

Lok Sabha proceedings continued with sloganeering by the Opposition.
A ruckus began in Lok Sabha again after the proceedings began at 12 PM.
Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi criticised personal remarks made against former Prime Ministers, calling them “reprehensible”. She said those aligned with the BJP and RSS ideology should also acknowledge the contributions of past Prime Ministers.
Lok Sabha proceedings adjourned till 12 PM amid ruckus by Opposition.

From 3:30 pm, the Lok Sabha will take up Private Members’ Business, during which several Bills are set to be introduced. These include proposals for constitutional changes, electoral law amendments, and welfare measures for farmers, fishermen, students, senior citizens, women and workers, along with legislation related to education, healthcare, environment, artificial intelligence, digital platforms, labour reforms and social security.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi criticised Congress leader and Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi in Rajya Sabha on Thursday over his alleged “traitor” remark against BJP MP Ravneet Singh Bittu, calling it an insult to the Sikh community and a sign of Congress’ “arrogance at its peak”.
The Lok Sabha will start the general discussion on the Union Budget at 11 AM, beginning with Question Hour. The House is also scheduled to take up Private Members’ Business later in the afternoon, where several proposed laws — including constitutional changes, electoral reforms and welfare measures — are expected to be introduced.

TITLE: Delhi To Launch Double-Decker Tourist Buses For Key Heritage Sites Soon | Check Routes And Fares
LINK: https://www.news18.com/cities/new-delhi-news/delhi-to-launch-double-decker-tourist-buses-for-key-heritage-sites-soon-check-routes-and-fares-ws-l-9883094.html
--------------------
The national capital is gearing up to introduce a new sightseeing experience for visitors with the launch of double-decker tourist buses later this month. The initiative, led by the Delhi government, will link major heritage and cultural landmarks through a specially designed tourism circuit across the heart of the city.
Senior officials said the service, likely to start in February, is being developed primarily for domestic and foreign tourists, with a strong focus on the central vista and nearby national monuments. The aim is to make some of Delhi’s most prominent attractions easier to access through a single, organised route.
Major Heritage Sites To Be Linked Via This Service
The planned circuit will include destinations such as the Pradhanmantri Sangrahalaya, National War Memorial, Bharat Mandapam, the new Parliament complex, Kartavya Path and Dilli Haat. Officials said the project seeks to present these landmarks as part of a unified tourism experience rather than isolated sites.
The use of double-decker buses is expected to enhance sightseeing, with elevated seating offering wider views of monuments and ceremonial avenues. Authorities believe this format will provide a more engaging and relaxed way for visitors to explore the city.
In addition to daytime operations, the tourism department is also working on evening sightseeing services. While the night-tour route has largely been finalised, details on operating hours are yet to be announced.
An electric double-decker bus, along with two other buses, is expected to begin service around February 20, coinciding with the first anniversary of the Delhi government. The electric vehicle has been supplied by a private firm under a corporate social responsibility initiative. Originally housed at the Okhla depot under the transport department, the bus has now been transferred to the tourism department.
Check Fares
According to officials, the service will operate from the Pradhanmantri Sangrahalaya and cover several major landmarks along the route. The fare has been fixed at Rs 500 for adults and Rs 300 for children aged between six and twelve years, news agency PTI reported.
A guide will be on board to brief passengers about the historical and cultural significance of each location. Information on booking procedures and schedules will be released ahead of the official launch.
Double-decker buses were once a familiar sight on Delhi’s roads, run by the Delhi Transport Corporation under the name “Suvidha", before they were discontinued in 1989 following the gradual withdrawal of the ageing fleet.

TITLE: Roads, Mining, Hydel Projects Claimed Nearly 1 Lakh Hectares Of India's Forest Land Since 2020
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/roads-mining-hydel-projects-claimed-nearly-1-lakh-hectares-of-indias-forest-land-since-2020-9882951.html
--------------------
Nearly 97,050 hectares of forest land was diverted for non-forestry purposes in the last five financial years, starting 2020-21, the Union Environment Ministry told Parliament. Madhya Pradesh accounted for the largest share, with 902 such proposals for non-forestry use approved and only six rejected between 1st April 2020 and 31st March 2025.
The government said that it gave the go-ahead to as many as 10,026 proposals during this period and rejected just 120 proposals—an overwhelmingly high approval rate, with only a handful of rejections. Some regions, like the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, where 26 projects were approved, saw no rejection. Jammu and Kashmir, as well as Manipur, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram in the Northeast, also saw no rejections.
Out of the total projects considered during the last five years, most of them were approved in Gujarat (1560), with Haryana (1424) and Uttar Pradesh (1188) following closely behind.
Roads cut the deepest into India’s forests, with nearly 22,233 hectares of forest land diverted for construction of roads alone. Mining and quarrying followed close behind, claiming 18,913 hectares of forest land, while hydel and irrigation projects claimed 17,434 hectares, and power transmission lines nearly 13,859 hectares. Remaining diversions were mostly for Defence (6,041 hectares), railways (5,957 hectares), and other developmental projects.
Responding to questions, Minister of State (Environment, Forests, and Climate Change) Kirti Vardhan Singh said the diversion was approved under the Van (Sanrakshan Evam Samvardhan) Adhiniyam, 1980. “The central government, following the prescribed statutory approval process, takes prompt decisions on proposals for diversion of forest land, including all development projects, that are complete in all respects," he told Parliament.
As per the conditions of approval, the states/UTs concerned have to ensure that a minimum number of trees are felled, and wherever feasible, translocation of trees is to be done, and the permission for felling of trees is given by the concerned states/UTs, he added.
While Madhya Pradesh recorded the maximum diversion of forest land—24,346 hectares—it was followed by Odisha (12,875 hectares), Gujarat (6,850), and Arunachal Pradesh (6,656 hectares), as per the data from 2020-21 to 2024-25.
The government attributed the reduction in timelines observed in the processing of Environmental Clearance (EC) proposals to “comprehensive regulatory reforms undertaken by the Environment Ministry, supported by technology-driven interventions such as GIS layers, Decision Support System". The minister also cited the recently launched online single-window system for processing such proposals, as well as amendments to the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006, and office memorandums issued from time to time for reducing the duration.
The government had also recently given appraisal powers to the State Environment Impact Assessment Authorities (SEIAAs) for sectors like mining, irrigation, and power projects, and also increased Expert Appraisal Committee meetings to at least twice a month to speed up proposal review.
Under the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006, project proposals are examined by an Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC), which reviews their environmental impacts. The committee recommendations are then placed before the ministry, which takes the final decision on granting or rejecting environmental clearance. Forest diversion proposals from states are reviewed by an advisory committee under the Van (Sanrakshan Evam Samvardhan Adhiniyam), 1980.

--------------------
The Government of India, the Government of Nagaland and representatives of the Eastern Nagaland Peoples’ Organisation (ENPO) on Wednesday signed a historic agreement in New Delhi.
The pact paves the way for the creation of the Frontier Nagaland Territorial Authority (FNTA) for six eastern districts of Nagaland that include Tuensang, Mon, Kiphire, Longleng, Noklak and Shamator and provides for the devolution of powers over 46 subjects to the new authority.
The agreement was signed in the presence of Union Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation Amit Shah and Nagaland Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio.
Calling the day “a very significant moment" for a dispute-free Northeast, Shah said the Modi government is committed to resolving every long-pending issue through dialogue and democratic means. He noted that since 2019, the Centre has signed 12 major agreements in the region, stressing that, unlike earlier governments, the current administration ensures their implementation “in letter and spirit."
Shah assured ENPO representatives that the Centre would actively support the development of Eastern Nagaland and shoulder its responsibilities. A fixed amount will be allocated annually for the region’s development, while the Union Ministry of Home Affairs will bear the initial expenditure for setting up the FNTA.
The Home Minister said people of Eastern Nagaland had long felt deprived since the state’s formation and acknowledged the region’s strategic importance. He credited sustained efforts by the Ministry of Home Affairs for bridging differences between the ENPO and the Nagaland government, leading to the resolution of the dispute.
Expressing gratitude to Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio and the Nagaland cabinet, Shah said their openness and cooperation helped take negotiations to a logical conclusion. “There will now be no obstacles in the path of Eastern Nagaland’s development," he said, adding that the agreement reflects the government’s commitment to fulfilling the genuine aspirations of the people.
Under the arrangement, a mini-secretariat for the FNTA will be set up, headed by an Additional Chief Secretary or Principal Secretary. Development outlay for Eastern Nagaland will be shared in proportion to population and area. The agreement clarifies that it does not affect the provisions of Article 371(A) of the Constitution.
The pact envisages accelerated development of Eastern Nagaland through greater financial autonomy, enhanced decision-making, improved infrastructure, economic empowerment and optimal use of resources. Senior officials from the Centre and the Nagaland government, along with the Deputy Chief Minister and other dignitaries, were present at the signing ceremony.

TITLE: 'To Protect Buyers, Deliver Their Dream Homes': SC Asks NBCC To Take Over Stalled Supertech Projects
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/to-protect-buyers-deliver-their-dream-homes-sc-asks-nbcc-to-take-over-stalled-supertech-projects-ws-l-9881884.html
--------------------
The Supreme Court on Thursday intervened to bring relief to thousands of Supertech homebuyers, issuing a landmark ruling for the state-owned National Buildings Construction Corporation to take over and finish 16 stalled projects under the real estate developer.
The court said this is to protect thousands who have waited over a decade for their Supertech housing units and to finally deliver their “dream homes" to them.
By invoking its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution, the SC said the National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) must take over. A bench comprising Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi used these plenary powers to uphold a December 2024 order by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).
The court said approximately 51,000 homes had been booked between 2010 and 2012, leaving families in limbo for years. To ensure progress remains uninterrupted, the bench has prohibited other legal bodies, including all high courts and tribunals, from issuing orders that might freeze the ongoing work. This is intended to allow the NBCC to complete the debt-ridden projects expeditiously and without further judicial interference.
The apex court said judicial priority is now focused entirely on the delivery of completed homes equipped with essential utilities, rather than the immediate demands of corporate creditors. Chief Justice Surya Kant made it clear that the interests and dues of financial and operational creditors will only be addressed after the delivery of fully-furnished houses to the buyers. These must have all the assured facilities, including water, electricity, sewage connections, roads, and parks.
As a result of this prioritisation, financial lenders are expected to accept reduced payments, or a “haircut", to facilitate the recovery process. The bench described these reduced payments as “just and equitable" and ruled that the NBCC’s takeover is not contrary to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).
“We find that the order passed by the NCLAT on December 12, 2024, in bringing the NBCC on record for the completion of the pending housing projects is neither unfair nor contrary to the provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC)," the bench ordered while taking recourse of Article 142, which grants the top court plenary power to pass any decree or order necessary for doing “complete justice" in any case.
The NBCC will now undertake the projects – previously estimated to cost approximately Rs 9,500 crore – with the support of an expert committee. While disposing of the pleas, the bench noted that parties may still approach the court should any new developments obstruct the ongoing construction.
On February 21, 2025, the court had stayed an order appointing the NBCC as the project management consultant to complete the 16 housing projects of Supertech at a cost of nearly Rs 9,500 crore.

TITLE: Poll Body's Big Attack On TMC Govt, Cites 'Systematic Pattern Of Violence' Against Officials
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/ecis-big-attack-on-tmc-govt-claims-systematic-pattern-of-violence-against-poll-officials-ws-kl-9882552.html
--------------------
The Election Commission of India (ECI) has accused the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government in West Bengal of “systematic pattern of violence and threats" against election officials, while also alleging police of unwillingness to act against such incidents.
After West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee appeared in the Supreme Court and spoke against the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, the poll body filed a counter in the apex court, alleging numerous instances of violence, intimidation and obstruction against election officials engaged in the SIR process.
Sujeet Kumar Mishra, Secretary, ECI, alleged a “pervasive reluctance" among local police authorities to register FIRs in response to grievances articulated by BLOs, and many of them were only filed after the direct intervention of the DEO (District Election Officer). While other states promptly adhered to ECI directives regarding SIR, West Bengal willfully neglected to do so.
Bengal CEO’s Office Gheraoed
In its response, the ECI claimed that protesters claiming to be BLOs attempted forceful entry into the office of Bengal’s Chief Electoral Officer (CEO), broke the police blockade and vandalised the office. It said officers were prevented from entering and leaving the office complex as the office was also gheraoed, resulting in significant impediments to the execution of duties by officers.
The ECI said it directed the Kolkata Police Commissioner to ensure that no untoward incident occurs again. Despite explicit directives to the police, the protesters were not removed and remained in the office premises for 28 hours. It further said that the CEO was the sole electoral official in the country who had been accorded ‘Y+’ category security.
It also detailed a disturbing pattern of conduct “previously unseen during electoral roll revision exercises" in Bengal, including a statement by a cabinet minister that he will “break the legs of Election Commission". The poll agency observed that groups of women, allegedly mobilised by political operatives, obstructed the activities of BLOs and EROs.
‘Provocative’ Statements Of Mamata Banerjee, Police Inaction
The Election Commission also observed that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee “persistently delivered a series of public addresses that are inherently provocative, thereby engendering an atmosphere of intimidation among the election officials tasked with the separation and revision of the electoral roll."
It also accused the CM of engaging in fear-mongering, disseminating misleading and erroneous information about the SIR process and threatening election officials, which prompted several observers to withdraw from their SIR responsibilities due to fear of violent assaults.
It also said BLOs are facing overwhelming stress due to systematic police indifference and the failure to register FIRs, interference by Booth Level Agents of political factions. A roll observer reported that women’s mob in Debipur shouting “BJP dalal" slogans, chasing team with broomsticks after the CM’s “kitchen tools" call.
The affidavit blamed “inadequacies of state machinery" and “prevailing climate of political interference" for a “singular and alarming breakdown" in West Bengal SIR. The Commission warned that political rhetoric from TMC leaders vitiates conditions for a “free, fair and fearless" revision process in West Bengal.
Mamata Banerjee has previously characterised the exercise as a vehicle for “unspeakable harassment", alleging it has resulted in “as many as 140 deaths" and violates the Representation of the People Act. In a series of letters addressed to the CEC, she has sounded an alarm on what she describes as “institutional overreach" and a “dangerous erosion of trust" in democratic processes.

LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/pm-modi-quotes-indira-gandhi-to-criticise-congress-govts-functioning-knew-shortcomings-but-ws-l-9882188.html
--------------------
Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a sharp attack on former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s development record, citing what he called systemic rigidity in India’s planning apparatus that hampered infrastructure projects for generations. Addressing Parliament during the Motion of Thanks to the President’s Address, PM Modi invoked Indira Gandhi’s own acknowledgment of the disconnect between policymakers and ground realities, using it to criticize the Planning Commission she once chaired.
“I had gone to Himachal Pradesh. When I returned, I told the Planning Commission that our workers need mules, not jeeps. But we were told that the funds are only available for jeeps; there is no policy to fund mules. They said, if there are no proper roads, then what use is a jeep," PM Modi said, quoting Indira Gandhi’s remarks.
PM Modi said this reflected “a system that knew its shortcomings but did not reform itself."
The Planning Commission, established in 1950 with Jawaharlal Nehru- Indira Gandhi’s father- as its first chairman, was responsible for drafting and implementing India’s Five-Year Plans. The Planning Commission was dissolved in 2014 under PM Modi’s government and replaced with NITI Aayog.
PM Modi highlighted the Congress party’s historical failure to deliver timely and efficient development, asserting, “A significant part of our energy is being spent on correcting the mistakes of the past. It takes great effort to erase the image that was created in the minds of the world during that period."
The Prime Minister also cited the Sardar Sarovar Dam on the Narmada River as a case study of delayed execution and policy inertia under previous administrations. The multipurpose dam’s foundation stone was laid in 1961 but it officially became operational only in 2017- more than five decades later and roughly 30 years after construction began in earnest.
The Sardar Sarovar Dam, part of the broader Narmada Valley development initiative, faced numerous obstacles over its decades-long journey. Construction was stalled in the 1990s by court orders related to rehabilitation and resettlement conditions for displaced communities. Procedural and clearance issues further bogged down progress, keeping it mired in administrative hurdles.
PM Modi contrasted the delays and inefficiencies of past governments with his administration’s emphasis on future-ready policies, strategic governance and faster project execution, arguing that India is now on a more decisive development path.
“That is why we have placed strong emphasis on future-ready policies. Today, the country is being governed on the basis of policy and strategy," PM Modi said.

--------------------
The Bihar government has announced a strict crackdown on the playing of obscene and double-meaning songs in public places and vehicles, warning of legal action, including fines and imprisonment, for violators.
Deputy Chief Minister and Home Minister Samrat Choudhary has issued firm directions to the police headquarters, instructing officers across all districts to immediately stop the playing of vulgar songs, whether in Bhojpuri, Magahi, Maithili or any other language. He has asked the police to launch special drives to identify offenders and initiate strict legal action against them.
Mr Choudhary said the decision was taken in the interest of social decency and public safety, noting that obscene songs played in public spaces have a deeply negative impact on society, particularly on children. He added that such content not only promotes vulgarity but also undermines women’s safety and dignity. Banning obscene songs, he said, is essential to creating a secure and respectful environment for women.
As part of the move, obscene songs will no longer be permitted in buses, auto-rickshaws, taxis, trains or any other public place. Following the government’s directive, Bihar Police has launched a statewide campaign along with a public appeal under the slogan “No obscene songs, build a civilised society".
The police have clarified that playing obscene or double-meaning songs in public will now be treated as a serious punishable offence. Drivers and vehicle owners found violating the order will face heavy fines and may also be sent to jail.
Under the new enforcement measures, police will register cases under Sections 296 and 79 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023, along with other applicable provisions. Citizens have been urged to oppose such acts and report violations to the nearest police station.
The state government has emphasised that public participation is crucial to eliminating obscenity from public life. Bihar Police, appealing to citizens, said a civilised and safe society can be achieved not only through strict laws but also through collective responsibility and cooperation.

--------------------
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India’s recent trade agreements with the United States and the European Union have generated a sense of economic stability and forward momentum, while creating wide-ranging opportunities for the country’s youth. Addressing the Rajya Sabha during the Motion of Thanks to the President’s Address, PM Modi described the agreements as “future‑ready" pacts that are strengthening India’s position in the global economy.
“After the trade deal with the US, there is a feeling of stability and a sense of forward movement," he said.
The Prime Minister said India is increasingly signing major trade deals with key global partners.
“In the past few days, we have signed agreements with nine significant nations. The most comprehensive of these is with a bloc of 27 countries, including the European Union," he added.
PM Modi highlighted that major economies are keen to strengthen trade ties with India. “Countries around the world are eager to expand trade relations with India. Whether it is the EU deal or the recent pact with the US, these agreements are receiving broad international praise," he said.
He also stressed the global significance of these agreements.
“When we signed the trade deal with the EU, the world became more confident about the greater likelihood of global stability. After the trade deal with the US, the world became even more confident that with stability, they can sense a speed too. This is a positive sign for the world," the Prime Minister said.
Highlighting the domestic impact, PM Modi said the agreements would directly benefit India’s youth across regions and social groups.
“The US trade deal will be most beneficial to the youth, including those from urban areas and rural, as well as for girls and boys. The demand for young professionals is growing around the world, and since so many foreign companies are setting up here, the opportunities are abundant for Indian young professionals as well," he said.
Placing India’s economic trajectory in a broader geopolitical context, the Prime Minister said the world is witnessing a major transition.
“There was a new world order after the Second World War, and now the world is moving towards a new world order. The bent is towards India, which is a vishvabandhu," he said.
Launching a sharp attack on the Congress, PM Modi said past governments had left behind a damaged global image.
“A significant part of our energy is being spent on correcting the mistakes of the past. It takes great effort to erase the image that was created in the minds of the world during that period. They left things in such a damaged state," he said.
He said this is why the NDA government has prioritised long-term policy planning.
“That is why we have placed strong emphasis on future-ready policies. Today, the country is being governed on the basis of policy and strategy," PM Modi said, taking a swipe at past controversies.
“Even now, when people speak about them, they don’t talk about trade deals. They talk about deals like Bofors," he said.
Asserting that global confidence in India is steadily rising, the Prime Minister said, “Global trust in India is growing. Guided by the mantra of ‘reform, perform, transform,’ we have moved forward, and the reality today is that the nation has boarded the Reform Express."
Describing the current decade as a defining phase for India, he added, “The first quarter of the 21st century has completed. But this second quarter is decisive, just like the second quarter of India’s freedom struggle in the last century was. I can clearly see that in the direction of building Viksit Bharat, this second quarter is going to be equally capable."

--------------------
The long-running dispute over nearly 45,000 square metres of land at Asaram’s ashram in Motera, Ahmedabad, has reached a decisive end, with the Gujarat High Court allowing the state government to reclaim the land, paving the way for the removal of illegal constructions and future development.
Following the ruling, authorities have accelerated preparations to clear unauthorised structures from the ashram complex. The land has been earmarked for expansion of the Sardar Patel Sports Enclave, a key project linked to the state’s preparations for the Commonwealth Games 2030.
According to official records, the premises contained at least 32 illegal structures, valued at around Rs 500 crore. Investigations found that these structures were not only illegal but were also being used for commercial purposes. Citing violations of building rules and encroachment on government land, the collector’s office had earlier issued notices to the ashram trust.
The trust subsequently sought to regularise the constructions by paying an “impact fee", but the request was rejected by the authorities, leading to the legal battle. Delivering the verdict, Justice Vaibhavi Nanavati ruled in favour of the state, observing that the government’s action was justified in view of serious rule violations and the larger public interest involved in development projects.
With the court’s clearance, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation is now authorised to remove the illegal structures at any time after completing security and procedural formalities. Officials said the land would be utilised for a modern sports complex, training facilities and a proposed Olympic village as part of the Sports Enclave project.
The verdict is being seen as a significant boost to Gujarat’s infrastructure plans, particularly its ambition to host the Commonwealth Games 2030. State officials have maintained that world-class sports facilities are essential for the event and that the Motera land is strategically critical to these preparations.
Asaram, who is serving a life sentence in a rape case and was recently granted conditional bail on medical grounds, visited the Surat ashram on January 2 after nearly 13 years. Videos showing followers welcoming him with music and celebrations had drawn public attention.

TITLE: 'Sahkar, Not Sarkar': Amit Shah Launches Bharat Taxi Service, Promises Big Benefits For Drivers
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/sahkar-not-sarkar-amit-shah-launches-bharat-taxi-service-promises-big-benefits-for-drivers-9881648.html
--------------------
Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday launched Bharat Taxi, a cooperative-owned platform that enables drivers to operate as owners, ensuring zero commission and eliminating surge pricing. The service aims to compete with apps like Uber and Ola.
The Cooperation Ministry described Bharat Taxi as a transformative initiative in the mobility sector, placing drivers —referred to as sarathis (charioteers) — at the centre of ownership, operations, and value creation, thereby freeing them from exploitative aggregator-based models.
Speaking at the launch event, Amit Shah said the Bharat Taxi service will provide major convenience for taxi drivers, saying that “sahkar (helper), not Sarkar (government)" is formally entering the taxi sector.
“In this system, every driver (Sarathi) is the owner of the taxi, and this structure will bring a revolutionary economic transformation. Like Amul in Gujarat, this is a unique cooperative model of its kind in the world. The wheels of your taxi will run for the benefit of the Sarathi community—this is the spirit of cooperation," he said.
Shah further revealed that Bharat Taxi was envisioned as a unified mobility platform that offered two-wheelers, three-wheelers and four-wheelers. “Bharat Taxi “Sarathi Didi" will play a key role in ensuring the safety, dignity, and empowerment of women riders and drivers," he added.
No Commissions, Lower Fares
The Home Minister said the taxi service will be rolled out in three years, and the government will charge 20% of the revenue earned by the platform, while the rest will be transferred into the accounts of each Sarathi.
“Until now, fares were first credited to the company’s account and a commission was deducted. That system ends here. Bharat Taxi will charge zero commission. Not even one percent," he added. “All payments will be transferred directly from the customer to the Sarathi’s account — no middleman, no delays."
Furthermore, the platform will also exclude booking fees, heavy platform charges, and hidden commissions from the Sarathi app, making it more convenient for drivers and travellers. All the profits earned will be directly transferred into accounts of the drivers associated with the Bharat Taxi service. However, Amit Shah also cautioned drivers to maintain professional standards and behaviour with travellers.
The event was also graced by Union Minister of State for Cooperation Krishan Pal Gurjar; Union Minister of State for Cooperation Murlidhar Mohol; Dr. Ashish Kumar Bhutani, Secretary, Ministry of Cooperation and other senior dignitaries.
The Cooperation Ministry said Amit Shah will distribute share certificates to the top six performing Sarathis, further reinforcing the core principle of ‘Sarathi Hi Malik’. Each honoured Sarathi will be provided with a personal accident insurance cover of Rs 5 lakh and a family health insurance cover of Rs 5 lakh, reflecting Bharat Taxi’s commitment to driver welfare and long-term social security.
Bharat Taxi prioritises social security for Sarathis through health insurance, accident insurance, retirement savings, and a dedicated driver support system. Support centres are being operated at seven key locations in Delhi. The platform provides rapid emergency assistance, verified ride data, and allows drivers the freedom to work on other platforms without any exclusivity clauses. To promote women’s empowerment, initiatives such as “Bike Didi" are being implemented, under which more than 150 women drivers have joined Bharat Taxi so far.

The West Bengal government has informed the Election Commission that it is ready to make available 8,505 Group B officers of the state or its instrumentalities for the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in the State, sources said.
This assumes significance as the counsel appearing for the poll panel had argued in the Supreme Court on February 4, 2026, that the West Bengal government provided the services of only 80 Grade 2 officers for overseeing the SIR exercise.
A Bench comprising Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and N.V. Anjaria is slated to hear on Monday (February 9, 2026) a batch of pleas, including the one filed by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, relating to the ongoing SIR process in the State.
Sources said that Ms. Banerjee, who on February 4 became the first serving chief minister to argue in the top court, may come to the apex court on Monday (February 9, 2026) again.
They said the West Bengal government has informed the poll panel that it is ready and willing to make available 8,505 Group B officers of the State or its instrumentalities for the SIR exercise there.
On February 4, senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, appearing for the poll panel, told the apex court that the state had provided the services of only 80 Grade 2 officers, such as SDMs, for overseeing the SIR process.
Mr. Dwivedi also said that only low-ranked government employees, such as Anganwadi workers, were provided by the West Bengal government for the exercise.
Ms. Banerjee had countered the ECI's charges and said the state had provided whatever was sought by the poll panel.
The chief minister had vehemently urged the top court to intervene in the SIR process in West Bengal to "save democracy", alleging that the State was being targeted and its people were being bulldozed.
The top court took note of Banerjee's petition against the SIR exercise and said that genuine persons must remain on the electoral rolls.
It issued notices and sought replies to the petition by February 9 from the Election Commission and the chief electoral officer of West Bengal.
The Bench also asked the poll panel to instruct booth-level officers and electoral roll officers to be more sensitive while issuing notices on grounds of minor discrepancies, such as mismatched spelling of names, etc.
On January 19, the top court passed a slew of directions, observing that the SIR process in West Bengal should be transparent and not cause any inconvenience.

The government will soon constitute a High-Level Committee on Banking for Viksit Bharat to draw up a blueprint to create mega-lenders capable of meeting the financing needs of a developed India, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said.
Credible and creditable: On Union Budget 2026-27
"We want the committee to tell us what kind of things we need to do so that banking is made available for funding Viksit Bharat," she told PTI videos in an interview.
Asked if it would suggest a merger of public sector banks, Ms. Sitharaman said one should not narrow it down like that.
"It is for India's banking sector to be made big enough, big enough in the sense, made or primed to take care of Viksit Bharat funding. You have to reach Viksit Bharat destination...it (Viksit Bharat) needs money, it needs financing, it needs credit, it needs banking facility to reach the common man." When asked about the timeframe for formation of the committee, she said, "We will do it at the earliest".
ALSO WATCH  Watch: Union Budget 2026 | Key takeaways
"I propose setting up a ‘High Level Committee on Banking for Viksit Bharat’ to comprehensively review the sector and align it with India's next phase of growth, while safeguarding financial stability, inclusion and consumer protection," she had said in the Budget speech on February 1, 2026.
To achieve scale and improve efficiency in the public sector NBFCs, as a first step, the Budget also proposed to restructure the Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and Rural Electrification Corporation (REC).
"A lot of work has happened in the ministry concerned. They have come up with this expectation. Let's see how they play it out," she said, when asked if a merger is on the cards.
REC is a subsidiary of State-owned power sector lender PFC. Both entities play a key role in funding power generation, transmission and distribution projects.
In March 2019, PFC completed the acquisition of a majority stake in REC Ltd by transferring ₹14,500 crore to the government.
PFC acquired 103.94 crore shares, constituting 52.63% stake, held by the government in REC, along with the management control. The acquisition price was worked out to ₹139.50 per share. This stake acquisition came following the in-principle approval from the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs.
Both PFC and REC are Navratna central public sector enterprises, and this acquisition was a step toward consolidating companies operating in the same space.
Last week, the PFC board gave in-principle approval for the merger of the non-banking finance company REC Limited with itself.
The board approval for the merger of PFC and REC came after an announcement made in this regard in the Budget on Sunday (February 1, 2026).

The Tamil Nadu government is currently studying the impact of the Home Again programme run by the non-governmental organisation (NGO) The Banyan, in collaboration with the government, and in partnership with other NGOs, in five districts. Based on this, it would like to take the programme to all districts in the State, said Chief Secretary N. Muruganandam.
Speaking at an event held to launch an impact report of the Emergency Care and Recovery Centre (ECRC) and Home Again programmes, on Saturday, he said halfway home initiatives were also being run, supported by the Department for the Welfare of the Differently Abled, and the impact of these were also being studied.
Mr. Muruganandam said the government was ensuring that residents of all homes for the mentally ill were being provided with services such as Aadhaar cards, pensions, ration cards, and priority was being given to them for housing and skill training.
He highlighted the importance of the need to focus on mental healthcare in the backdrop of the rising incidence of mental illness across the country, especially in a highly urbanised State such as Tamil Nadu, which also has a rising ageing population.
Earlier, during a panel discussion on sustainability and bridging care gaps, Supriya Sahu, Environment and Forests Secretary,  stressed the need for continuity of funding and community engagement in order to be able to ensure sustainability for any initiative, including the ECRC programme. J. Radhakrishnan, Chairman and Managing Director, TNEB, and Chairman, TNPGCL, underscored the need for attention during disasters during which vulnerable people were more affected.
P. Senthil Kumar, Health Secretary, said 32 districts had functional ERCR and seven more were in the pipeline, highlighting the challenges of mobilising resources and the need for further strengthening of systems. Speaking during a previous panel discussion M. Lakshmi, Commissioner for Welfare of the Differently Abled said the Home Again programme had helped reunite several people with their families, while many more had managed to find livelihood opportunities and reintegrate into society.
Archana Padmakar, chief executive officer, The Banyan, speaking on the impact report, noted the creation of 1,091 beds over five years for the homeless mentally ill, 138 Home Again houses across the country, and, significantly, the fact that 50% of those who accessed these services had gone back to their families, with re-admission rate being only 2%. She noted that a large number of those accessing the services had multiple co-morbidities including HIV, tuberculosis, diabetes, and suffered from malnutrition. She also highlighted The Banyan’s focus on smaller being better — smaller units, moving from custodial to community care, and patient-centric care.
The event also saw awards being presented to civil society organisations and government officials running ECRC and Home Again centres across the districts. Former Chief Secretary of Kerala, S.M. Vijayanand, Darez Ahmed, MD and CEO of GuidanceTN, Arun Thamburaj, Mission Director, National Health Mission, Tamil Nadu, and M. Malaiappan, Director, Institute of Mental Health, were among those who participated.

DMK president and Chief Minister M.K. Stalin said on Saturday (February 7, 2026) that Tamil Nadu should give “zero”-seat tally to the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the Assembly election as the BJP-led Union government had given “zero” to Tamil Nadu in the Union Budget and did not fulfil the genuine demands of the State.
Addressing the South Zone DMK Youth Wing conference near Kariyapatti in Virudhunagar district, Mr. Stalin said Tamil Nadu had been the ‘numero uno’ State in the country in all departments during the last five-year rule of the DMK. “It has been ranked number one in the Union government’s ratings and also by national and international magazines. Tamil Nadu’s progress has no parallel,” he said.
However, Tamil Nadu has got nothing in the Union Budget, belying the anticipation that the poll-bound State would get some benefits from the Union government. Mr. Stalin said all that Tamil Nadu demanded was more funds for disaster management, Metro Rail, drinking water schemes, and railway projects, permission for the new airport in Hosur, 50% devolution of Central funds to the State, exemption from NEET, expedited construction of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Madurai, and the promise of not reducing the number of Lok Sabha seats under delimitation. But nothing has been granted by the Union government. “They gave us zero. The BJP-led NDA should be given zero in the Assembly election, similar to what they got in the 2024 Lok Sabha election,” Mr. Stalin said.
He ridiculed AIADMK general secretary Edappadi K. Palaniswami for claiming that he was the head of the NDA in the State. However, the BJP has made the AIADMK a branch of the national party, and he was not raising his voice in the interest of Tamil Nadu, he alleged.
Mr. Stalin also criticised the AIADMK’s proposed protest against the DMK for preventing the Viksit Bharat-Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB-G RAM G) scheme.
“Does Mr. Palaniswami even know the name of this new scheme? The Union government did not give [funds for providing] jobs even for 50 days when the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme guaranteed jobs for 100 days. How will the Union government ensure that the jobs are given for 125 days as promised, this when the States have been made to contribute 40% of the funds [towards the scheme]?” he asked.
The BJP that has tasted only defeat in the State and the AIADMK, which has seen multiple defeats, should not only be defeated again in the upcoming Assembly election but also with a bigger margin to make the State more progressive, the Chief Minister added.

The Shahalibanda police registered a case of cheating and criminal intimidation against a person, following a complaint by a resident, who alleged financial fraud and threats linked to a failed business arrangement.
The complaint was lodged on Sunday by the victim, who said that he did not approach the police earlier as he was intimidated by the accused.
As per the police, Ayub Khan, a rowdy-sheeter, lured the victim into a business partnership in 2024, and asked him to invest ₹4.70 lakh. Later, the accused misappropriated the profits and took gold ornaments weighing about six tolas from the complainant on the pretext of clearing debts. The ornaments were allegedly mortgaged and not returned.
When the complainant sought settlement of his dues, Ayub allegedly threatened him with serious consequences, police said.

Launching a broadside against the Bharat Rashtra Samiti (BRS), Deputy Chief Minister Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka said the party which pushed the State into a debt burden of ₹8 lakh crore during its 10 years rule is now asking for votes in the upcoming municipal elections.
“Should people vote for a party that looted the State for 10 years,” he asked while addressing a public meeting after holding a huge election rally in the poll-bound Wyra town of Khammam district on Sunday.
Addressing a huge gathering on the penultimate day of electioneering, Mr. Vikramarka said, “The previous BRS rulers betrayed the people and looted public money, leaving the State in a precarious financial position. After coming to power, the Congress government implemented a plethora of pioneering welfare schemes for the welfare of all.”
These welfare initiatives include construction of Indiramma houses, free travel for women in the TGSRTC buses, free fine rice and free electricity of up to 200 units to households under Gruha Jyoti scheme.
He said, “The previous BRS government failed to conduct Group-I recruitment examination during its 10-years tenure. The Congress government has successfully conducted Group-I, Group-II and Group-III examinations and filled 70,000 government jobs within two years of coming to power.”
The “people’s government” initiated a slew of concrete measures to support women self-help groups by extending interest-free loans and providing skill development training in their pursuit of economic empowerment, he added.

The budget has brought some cheer to India’s research community, particularly for those involved in astronomy and space research, as it has earmarked ₹13,416.20 crore for the Department of Space for 2026-27.
A large chunk of the allocation has been set aside for deep-space exploration and astrophysics, including to build two advanced telescope facilities: the 30-m National Large Optical-Infrared Telescope and the National Large Solar Telescope near Pangong Lake in Ladakh.
Also in focus is the COSMOS-2 planetarium in Amaravati, Andhra Pradesh, to be completed soon, and improving the control systems of the Himalayan Chandra Telescope in Hanle, Ladakh. Currently, only the U.S., China, Japan and the European Union prioritise astronomy research to a high degree and constantly invest large sums to upgrade their terrestrial and space telescopes. So, astronomers have said, the telescope allocations will improve space research capability and science outreach in India.
However, experts also raised concerns about a significant drop in expenditure, with the actual expense falling short of budgetary estimates. This underutilisation has in the past led to bottlenecks in the planning and executing major projects.
“There were several proposed space missions which were finally not supported,” Bhaswati Mookerjea, professor and chairperson of the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, said.
Dr. Mookerjea added that although this budget “is an extremely positive step for astronomy in India,” the importance of following it through couldn’t be overstated: “The execution of big projects in India would still require some streamlining of resources with checks and balances.”
Only a few large astronomical observatories are capable of frontier research and groundbreaking discoveries worldwide, which means researchers have to compete for observation time. And when funding agencies favour their own national researchers, international scientists’ access becomes increasingly restricted, and Indians are no exception.
To make matters worse, an astrophysicist (who didn’t wish to be identified) told this reporter that India’s problem is compounded by the attitude of bureaucrats and administrators.
“They are close-minded regarding concepts like buying fractional time on large telescopes or missions — measures that are not only essential to foster stronger international collaborations and keep us at the forefront of astronomy research, but also serve as a stop-gap arrangement till we have our own large telescopes,” the astrophysicist said.
For far too long has the country relied on overseas facilities for high-resolution data and specialised equipment to do space science, including collaborative projects such as radio, optical, and space-based observations. Acquiring strong domestic capabilities in space science and astrophysics is thus imperative if India is to reduce its dependence on foreign observatories.
Building large-scale, next-generation observatories for cutting-edge space research, however, involves overcoming formidable financial and technological hurdles. These challenges often require collaborative partnerships with international teams and pooling resources and expertise with them is often the only way for Indian scientists to participate in ambitious projects. Adequate funding, effective governance and partnership with domestic industry offer a realistic solution to shrug off this dependence on foreign facilities and research data.
Fortunately, India’s astronomy and space research ecosystem is being steadily strengthened with the addition of cutting-edge technology platforms. These include optical and radio telescopes, such as the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) near Pune, and data processing centres capable of AI-driven data analysis. These efforts, alongside the new budgetary push, could boost India’s research capabilities, with the growing shift towards public-private partnerships in space research adding to the optimism.
“Basic science and big budget experiments all over the world require funding from state agencies” Dr. Mookerjea said. “While there are many private enterprises in the space sector, proper channeling of their efforts and overall quality control and monitoring would require setting up of statutory bodies involving government agencies.”
“In the past decade or so we have seen many startups in the space sector, often working in close collaboration with Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) experts,” Abhimanyu Susobhanan, assistant professor of physics at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Thiruvananthapuram, said. “The Department of Space established the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre in 2020 to promote such partnerships. This is a positive sign as such partnerships will promote innovation and attract private investment in the space sector.”
For that to happen, however, policymakers should acknowledge “the imperative for strategic resource allocation and collaborative initiatives to maximise the scientific output from the country’s astronomical assets.” But, he cautioned, “we also have to keep in mind that private interests may not always align with the interests of the nation as a whole.”
An important upside of developing homegrown cutting-edge resources in space science is that it will encourage students to engage in advanced research in the country, arresting the steady brain drain to institutions abroad. But that has been easier said, with a lot of homework still being required before it becomes a reality. For instance, the GMRT is the world’s largest radio telescope array operating at low frequencies and attracts astronomers from across the world. But in the absence of a comparable optical telescope in the country, Indian scientists are forced to stand in line for telescope time at foreign facilities, as they do for doing research in high frequency radio astronomy.
Similarly, India doesn’t have any telescope that operates in the critical sub-millimeter wavelengths.
“The sub-millimetre sky is a unique window for probing the architecture of the universe and structures within it, from the dusty sub-millimetre galaxies to the ringed nature of proto-stellar disks,” Dr. Mookerjea said. “A proposal is in the pipeline and it is also a part of the Astronomy & Astrophysics Mega Science Vision 2035.”
Only when such projects are realised can India’s march towards becoming a leader in space exploration gather pace.

TITLE: AAP leaders accuse Congress’ Bajwa of making derogatory remark against Punjab Cabinet Minister

The ruling AAP in Punjab on Sunday (February 8, 2026) slammed Congress leader Partap Singh Bajwa, accusing him of making objectionable remarks against Cabinet Minister Harbhajan Singh.
Congress leaders, however, rejected the charge and accused the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) of attempting to twist facts and misuse the sensitive issue of Dalits for political mileage by levelling false allegations against Mr. Bajwa.
In a joint statement in Chandigarh, Finance Minister Harpal Singh Cheema, Forest Minister Lal Chand Kataruchak, and AAP leader Baltej Pannu alleged that the Congress party has an “anti-Dalit” mindset and asked Mr. Bajwa to apologise within 24 hours, failing which strict legal action will be taken.
Mr. Cheema said Harbhajan Singh is a personality who rose out of poverty, cleared the civil services examination through hard work, and became an excise and taxation officer. He resigned from his job to join the Aam Aadmi Party, the Finance Minister added.
“The Aam Aadmi Party gave him respect and made him a Minister. But today, Partap Singh Bajwa used extremely derogatory words against him, which is an insult to the entire Dalit community,” Mr. Cheema claimed.
He alleged that all Dalit Ministers are on the Congress party’s target. Using such language against Dalits is extremely unfortunate, he said.
“This is a big insult to the Dalit community of Punjab. It is a matter that discourages children who move ahead in their lives through hard work in Punjab,” he added.
The Finance Minister further alleged that many Congress leaders are “repeatedly targeting Dalits and Scheduled Caste people of Punjab and insulting them in public rallies”.
Forest Minister Kataruchakk said that this is not a new remark by Mr. Bajwa. “From time to time, he targets leaders who rise from among workers and Dalits. Earlier, too, he made many comments against Dalit leaders,” he claimed.
AAP leader Pannu said that Mr. Bajwa's remark points to how much “hatred” Punjab Congress leaders carry in their minds about the Dalit community. “They are calling Harbhajan Singh a ‘band player’,” he said.
Defending Mr. Bajwa, Congress leader Aruna Chaudhry said that the AAP was attempting to create controversy out of a non-issue.
She said the people of Punjab, including the Dalit community, are politically aware and capable of recognising genuine casteist remarks without needing AAP to act as “self-appointed defenders”.
“AAP is rattled because Leader of Opposition Bajwa is exposing their failures and corruption both inside the Assembly and among the public. To divert attention, they are resorting to false narratives and baseless allegations,” she said in a statement.
Chairman of the Punjab Congress Scheduled Caste Cell, Kuldeep Vaid, said the AAP has crossed all limits of political decency by falsely accusing Mr. Bajwa of making a “casteist slur” against a Cabinet Minister.
There was no mention of any individual’s caste in Mr. Bajwa’s remarks, and AAP was deliberately misleading the public, he alleged.
“AAP leaders seem incapable of understanding the difference between a political pun and a casteist slur. Their attempt to provoke sentiments and exploit the Dalit community for political gain is highly condemnable,” Mr. Vaid said.
Several senior Congress leaders, including MLAs Vikram Chaudhry and Balwinder Singh Dhaliwal, along with Ex MLAs Pawan Kumar Adia, Santokh Singh Bhalaipur and Joginder Pal Bhoa, also came out in support of Mr. Bajwa.
They collectively condemned AAP’s attempt to malign his image and mislead the public.

Chief Minister M.K. Stalin being felicitated at a function by JACTTO-GEO for considering the demands of its members.
Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin said on Sunday that the Union government was creating a financial crisis in a planned manner for the State, and his government had been overcoming it not only politically but also administratively, even while fulfilling the demands of government employees.
He was speaking at a ceremony organised by the Joint Action Council of Tamil Nadu Teachers’ Organisation and Government Employees’ Organisation (JACTTO-GEO) to thank him for considering the demands of its members.
Mr. Stalin said the Tamil Nadu Assured Pension Scheme (TAPS) was implemented at a crucial juncture when the Centre had been consistently reducing the State’s share of tax revenue and was not releasing even the allocated funds properly. Changes in the Goods and Services Tax regime had reduced the State’s tax revenue, he said.
The DMK government had fulfilled the long-pending demands of teachers and government employees by recognising their valuable contribution to society. A government is a synthesis of elected representatives and its employees. The Council of Ministers and the government employees are two sides of a coin. This was the path shown by former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi, whose rule was a golden period for the government employees and teachers, he said.
Mr. Stalin said the government employees play a crucial role in delivering welfare schemes formulated by the government to the people. Calling the work done by the teachers a noble service to society, he said that because of them, Tamil Nadu stands as one of the best States for education in India.
He said the credit for the implementation of the DMK government’s flagship schemes since 2021 goes to the government employees. The Chief Minister said the Old Pension Scheme was stopped when the AIADMK was in power. This made the hard-working government employees suffer. But the DMK government was compassionate and inclusive, he said.

The Ernakulam rural police and the Excise on Sunday (February 8) registered nine cases under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act as they launched an intensive raid among migrant labourers in and around Perumbavoor amid a rise in complaints over drug peddling. Three migrant women, who were staying in lodges without valid documents, were taken into custody during the drive.
Searches were conducted in the dwelling places of migrant people, the market and buses by over 100 police and excise personnel. The dog squad and bomb squad were also involved in the raids led by Perumbavoor ASP Hardik Meena. The action was part of the steps initiated by District Police Chief (Ernakulam rural) K.S. Sudarshan to prevent conflict between residents and migrant labourers in the area.
As part of the measures, the police have decided to form a committee involving departments and organisations concerned and representatives of local people and migrants to address the law and order issues relating to the migrant population and local people, the police said on Sunday.
Perumbavoor sub-divisional police officer will be the convener of the committee, while the inspector of police, Perumbavoor station, will be the joint convener. Heads of Perumbavoor municipality and Vengola and Vazhakulam grama panchayats, as well as representatives of political, religious and cultural forums, will be the office-bearers of the panel.
The committee will be formed with the aim of conducting a comprehensive study into the alleged drug and alcohol use and related crimes among the migrant population and taking necessary steps. The committee will meet every month, and the police will chalk out their strategy based on the inputs from the meetings.
Earlier this week, the District Police Chief held a meeting with residents of Perumbavoor and assured action against offenders involved in the drug trade and other illegal activities. He also warned of strict action against vigilante activities by residents.

As denotified, nomadic, and semi-nomadic tribes (DNTs) across the country come together to demand a “separate column” for themselves in the 2027 Census forms, linguist and cultural scholar professor G.N. Devy has warned that India risks further alienating these communities—classified as “criminal” under the colonial-era 1871 Criminal Tribes Act and left uncounted since the formation of the Republic—if they are not explicitly counted.
In an exclusive interview with The Hindu, professor Devy—who headed the Ministry of Social Justice’s Technical Advisory Group on DNTs in 2006, and co-founded the DNT-Rights Action Group (DNT-RAG) with author Mahasweta Devi—said that inclusion of the DNTs must begin with a declaration by the Census Commissioner that these communities will be counted explicitly. He added that the problem of alienating over 10 crore people could become much bigger than that of counting them.
Edited Excerpts:
What opportunity does the upcoming Census present for the welfare of DNTs, given that caste will be enumerated in 2027?
The census and the Criminal Tribes Act (CTA) were both instituted in 1871. While the census has continued unbroken, except for this time, the plight of DNTs has also continued, with no proper count, except in 1931. The Iyengar Committee in 1950, the NHRC in the early 2000s, the Renke Commission in 2008, and the Idate Commission (2017) have all called for a census of DNTs. Yet questions such as ‘Have you been a DNT?, Have you been nomadic or semi-nomadic? Or denotified former criminal tribe?’ have never been included in Census schedules.
If that is not done this time, and if the DNTs are taken for a ride again with no specific data emerging at the end of the exercise, India will alienate close to 10 crore or more people from the mainstream. The problem can be much bigger than the problem of calculating, tabulating, and making a proper list.
This should have been a primary question even in the household surveys. It would be of great interest to any household surveyor to account for nomadic communities. People without houses are counted as a general classification. That speaks about houseless people, but not about DNTs.
This exclusion has been the worst. This is a motiveless malignity, and the census has no reason to exclude them. But the Census excludes them just because it did so earlier.
How can the government ensure the Census is truly inclusive of DNTs?
First, the census should declare that DNTs will be enumerated. That message will go around the communities across the country. Now, saying that “we will enumerate everybody, and therefore that will also include DNTs’, is like saying that “we are not doing an independent and exclusive census of the DNTs”. So that must be done. They do not need any special permission to introduce the question.
Secondly, the technology used should be accessible. Where it is not, there must be a system for people to go to an office and declare their DNT status. Third, the Census must avoid creating a long and unmanageable list of documents, because historically, even panchayats have refused to issue birth certificates to DNTs. And the fourth, after the census gets its data on DNTs, they must quickly consult the Anthropological Survey of India and get that data verified. And this data must be open for scrutiny by scholars as far as the DNTs issue is concerned.
There is a resentment among many DNT communities over their misclassification into SC/ST/OBC lists when they seek a list of their own. Must the DNT classification be exclusive of these identities?
The question of identity is never singular. The DNT identity is not exclusive of other identities. There is intersectionality. This is a complexity in the bureaucratic process. I accept that. But that is no fault of the DNTs. We cannot tell them that we have already messed up our bureaucratic processes, and therefore, we can no longer think of you. That’s not a good justification. These processes can be improved. Fortunately, with the help of technology, multiple classifications and multiple classificatory tags can be sorted out easily.
Amidst calls for separate quotas for DNTs, exclusive of SC, ST, and OBC identities (where they might exist), how can these reservations account for this intersectionality?
The demands for reservations, DNT reservations, and DNT representation in the Assembly, Panchayat or Parliament have been around for quite a while. But there are two different issues: the first is just to count the DNTs and create a factual report on who they are, where they are, and how many they are. The second question is whether they should be given reservations or not. That will depend on the results of the Census.
The political decisions on whether to give reservations to DNTs or not and whether it should be aligned with the SC or ST reservation, or independent, are the next step. But in the absence of credible data, no such decision can be taken at all. To fear that such a decision will have to be taken, and therefore not to do enumeration, is not a logical line of action. Let the count take place first. Governments can then decide, and the people themselves will also know whether to demand reservations or drop the demand.

Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal on Sunday (February 8, 2026) refuted any allegations of friction between him and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and that Ministers other than him did not know the contours of the agreement with the U.S., telling The Hindu in an interview that “people have mixed up two different issues”.
In the interview, as well as in previous press conferences, Mr. Goyal said that the Ministry of External Affairs would answer questions on whether India would be stopping its Russian oil imports, as U.S. President Donald Trump has claimed.
Opposition parties had alleged that even Mr. Jaishankar was not answering the question, and was instead passing it on to the Commerce Minister, citing an interview Mr. Jaishankar gave during his trip to Washington.
Watch: U.S.-India trade deal | What are the red flags? | Worldview
“See the question to which he [Mr. Jaishankar] replied,” Mr. Goyal said in the interview. “The question was about the nuances of the trade deal. So if there’s anything about the trade deal, obviously I will reply. People have mixed up two different issues.”
“If you ask the Agriculture Minister about the trade deal, he won’t answer,” he added. “If you ask me about what’s happening with, let’s say, the oil mission, I wouldn’t be able to respond. I would have a general idea, but I would not like to make a statement on record without full knowledge of facts. Each person handles his own responsibility.”
India-U.S. trade deal: Piyush Goyal rejects claims India yielded to U.S. demands
Mr. Goyal also sought to address the concerns of the farmers unions as well, asserting that “not a single farmer had anything to worry about” as sensitive items have been excluded from the deal, while others have been dealt with through quotas, phased duty eliminations, and margins of preference.
“Different tools have been used to protect our farmers, so I see absolutely no reason for any farmer to complain,” he said.
Excerpts from the interview:
What has been the departure in this deal from India’s previous relationship with the U.S.?
I think it’s in continuation of our very strong and important strategic relationship. They are one of our most important partners in the world. We are both large democracies. We have shared interests in several sectors. We have a strong defence partnership. We have a strong technology partnership. We have a strong critical minerals partnership. We also are members of two Quads together, so it’s a very, very powerful relationship. The trade agreement further enhances our relationship and elevates it to a much deeper friendship.
But didn’t these trade issues create a knot in that relationship?
As much as we expand our cooperation and engagement with the world’s largest economy, a $30 trillion market that is opening up for us, I’m sure it will only be good for the country.
Were the negotiations difficult?
Not at all. It was just like any other negotiation. Every country has to work towards getting a fair, equitable and balanced agreement. Everybody has sensitivities, just like we have sensitivities of, let’s say, certain farm produce. They have sensitivities on certain produce on their end. Everybody ensures that you take care of your defensive interests. And clearly everybody is looking for openings, new opportunities to expand trade in a manner that the people, the businesses of both countries can benefit.
Could you give us some insight on the behind-the-scenes process?
I would think more work happened virtually. And that’s one of the learnings from COVID. Most negotiations happened virtually right until the end. I was here, my teams were here, and they were there. We would have phone calls of and on if the issue was small, if it was substantive we would have video conferences.
What was the one issue that took time to reach an agreement on?
I don’t think there’s any such issues, any one issue that was a road block to the agreement. It was a very smooth and very amiable dialogue in a very friendly atmosphere with a lot of fun and frolic and laughter and also intense negotiation.
Our red line was related to agriculture…
Largely. All of India’s sensitivities, every single one of them, have been safeguarded. The sensitivities have been protected by carefully seeing what are the products where India is self-sufficient, farmers have good production, we don’t import at present or will not be required to import, and we have excluded these from the scope of this agreement.
So meat is not covered, for example, except turkey. Poultry is excluded. Dairy is excluded. No GM food products are included. No concessions have been given on soybean, corn, rice, wheat, sugar, cereals, millets like jawar, bajra, raggi, kodo, amaranth, fruits like banana, strawberries, cherries, citrus fruits, pulses in which we are self-sufficient in India, like green peas, kabuli chana, moong, oil seeds, certain animal feed, ground nuts, honey, malt and its extracts, non-alcoholic beverages, flour and the meals made of flour, starch, essential oils, ethanol for fuel, and tobacco, among others.
So after this, the farmers have really no cause for complaint and have absolutely nothing to be worried about.
But some farmer groups, such as those growing cotton, are unhappy…
This will help cotton farmers because exports can grow leaps and bounds. We have a competitive edge in textiles compared to our competitors. Now, markets in the U.K., Europe, EFTA countries, Australia, New Zealand, so many new markets, all in the developed world, at 0% duty are going to support our textiles. In America, our reciprocal tariff of 18% is amongst the lowest among our peer group of competing economies, so effectively the demand for cotton is going to go up.
We do need to import the extra long staple cotton, which we don’t have in India in insufficient quantity. So, if we give them an opening in or a quota in cotton, it’s actually good for the Indian ecosystem. Exports will grow, and as exports grow, the demand for domestic cotton also grows.
There’s so many items where they are opening up the large U.S. market for our farm produce and processed foods to be exported. We already are a large exporter. We export $54 billion-$55 billion every year of these products. In that situation, we are now looking at how we can double that.
Sadly, the opposition parties have such a small and weak mindset that they’re trying to distort the story and misguide our innocent farmers. I want them to understand that we are opening up new opportunities in Europe, US, Australia, New Zealand.
Further to that, with the U.S., we have also got 0% reciprocal tariff on a large variety of agriculture products such as spices, masalas, tea, coffee and their extract, copra and coconut oil, many nuts like areca nut, Brazil nut, cashew nut, chestnut, which you make in India, fruits and vegetables like avocado bananas, guavas, mangos, kiwis, papayas, pineapples, shiitake mushrooms.
What are the areas where American demands could be accommodated?
There are many areas, like tree nuts, for example. We have been importing pistachios for decades, right from the Congress time. There are certain things in which you don’t have in sufficient quantity and we’ve done a very calibrated opening in all of these products.
Wherever we need those products, we have opened them. Wherever we think we need to also keep a restriction, we have kept quotas. In some cases, we’re giving a margin of preference, not a full duty reduction. In some cases, it’s a phased elimination over a period of time. So, different tools have been used to protect our farmers, so I see absolutely no reason for any farmer to complain.
One general concern has been the commitment to buy $500 billion of US goods…
Well, it’s an intention. And it comes out of the fact that we have a big demand for particular goods that you don’t have in India, which we have to import. For example, energy such as crude oil, LNG, LPG, we have to import, we don’t have it in sufficient quantity in India. In aircraft, we have already placed orders worth $50 billion with Boeing. In addition to that, we need engines and spare parts. Plus the airline companies tell us they’re placing more orders.
We’ll probably need anywhere between $80-100 billion of planes and their parts and engines in the next 5 years. On ICT products, when we give concessions to data centres and hope to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in data centres and AI and quantum computing, we will need equipment, we will need NVIDIA chips and GPUs.
We made an assessment and we realised that even today we are importing $300 billion of these goods from different parts of the world. A large part of it comes from geographies that are not our preferred sources.
Is this deal concentrating our supply chain towards the US?
This $300 billion that we are importing right now is growing every year. We estimate that in the next 5 years, we will need $2 trillion of all of these products, which can also come from the US. I have a full intention to buy that and to diversify from our existing sources.
The joint statement mentions that the two countries would take “complementary actions to address non-market policies of third parties”. Is this aimed at China?
I would not like to speculate on any one particular geography, but any country that has non-market economy practises, we have to take care against such countries that distort the market. They affect jobs, business opportunities, and investments in our country, and therefore, we work with trusted partners and America is one of our most trusted partners. We would like to engage with them on these issues in a spirit of cooperation.
Our trade deals with some other countries involved liberalising Indian labour movement, but this one does not…
None of the trade deals ever deal with immigration. Trade deals have an element of people for implementing the objectives of the trade deal. So, for example, if somebody gets a contract to do the plumbing in a hotel in Switzerland, I will need to send people to do the plumbing. So trade deals only address mobility from that perspective. Even with the European Union, the deal we have provided is that if somebody goes as a student, they will get a nine month visa to be able to work there.
Every trade deal stands on its own legs, but bear in mind, immigration is never discussed in a trade deal. So even with the European Union, the mobility partnership is outside the trade deal. It’s a separate partnership.
The joint statement also had a line that says that both countries can modify their commitments if the other changes agreed upon tariffs. Did India insist on this inclusion?
It’s a standard WTO provision, that if any country changes the situation that exists at the type of entering into an agreement to the detriment of the other country, by which the effects of the free trade agreement don’t flow as they are intended to flow, then the other country has a right to rebalance. It’s also not that we are doing it for the first time.
Do you think that now the older multilateral organisations, especially economic ones like the WTO are now redundant?
Not at all. Multilateral organisations play a very important role. India respects WTO rules of trade. I believe they add value to the global order, to the rules-based global trading business. But I think we have to accept that with changing times, there will be some changes. We are actively in dialogue at the WTO to look at WTO reforms.
The question of great interest is on India’s policy on Russian oil…
I don’t deal with that subject. It is not part of my joint statement or the trade deal.
But your colleague in the Ministry of External Affairs made a statement that he’s not dealing with that issue and that you are.
See the question to which he replied. The question was about the nuances of the trade deal. So if there’s anything about the trade deal, obviously I will reply. People have mixed up two different issues. If you ask the agriculture minister about the trade deal, he can’t answer. If you ask me about what’s happening with, let’s say, the oil mission, I wouldn’t be able to respond. I would have a general idea, but I would not like to make a statement on record without full knowledge of facts. Each person handles his own responsibility.
Do you still feel that we will see the formal agreement by mid-March?
Oh yes. Unlike with other countries, where we did the framework agreement and then got down to the nitty-grities, in the U.S. case, we’ve done a full negotiation of all the issues literally line by line. So, the negotiation part is nearly complete. We’ll be able to close it quickly.
The joint statement came before because the reciprocal tariff has to come down to 18%. The executive order of reducing it to 18%, we hope to see next week.

Promising help to Karnataka in uplifting farmers through infrastructure development, Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Sunday said that the Centre will, without any discrimination, help the State in agri processing and value addition activities to help increase farmers’ income.
“The Centre will not discriminate farmers based on their political affiliations. It is the responsibility of the State and the Central governments to work for farmers’ welfare. Farmers are above all political affiliation,” he said here at the valedictory function of the International Trade Fair.
His statement came in response to State Agriculture Minister N. Cheluvarayaswamy who, pointing out at effective implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Formalisation of Micro food processing Enterprises, sought further financial assistance in different schemes for developing food parks, cold storages, transport services, branding and exports of Karnataka’s agri produce to bring better income to farmers.
Mr. Cheluvarayaswamy also said that agriculture should grow beyond politics.
Offering a slew of helping measures from the Centre, the Union Minister said that though Karnataka is the largest producer of toor dal in the country, the average yield per hectare is less than the national average. “Under pulse mission, the Centre will offer help to increase productivity through scientific and technical support.”
Announcing the setting up of 25 ‘seed villages’, he said that the Centre will particularly assist setting up of ‘seed villages’ where farmers would produce their own seeds, in the toor dal growing regions of the State.
“The Centre will encourage FPOs, farmers’ organisations, and private sector with a financial support of ₹25 lakh each to set up 35 dal mills,” he said.
Acknowledging that coconut production had declined owing to old or disease-afflicted coconut plantations, Mr. Chouhan said that the Coconut Development Board will encourage the planting of new high yielding varieties of coconut. Technical teams have been set up to help prevent diseases in coconut trees, and that Karnataka should utilise their services, he added.
The Union Minister said: “Rice varieties that could reduce labour cost, consume 20% less water and could be harvested 18 to 20 days earlier are being developed. The ICAR is developing special varieties that could suit the needs of Karnataka. The Centre will help Karnataka take its millets and processed food produce to the international market.”
He also said that the Centre will release ₹154 crore under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana shortly along with another ₹191 crore.
The Union Agriculture Minister also visited the Indian Institute of Horticulture Research here and interacted with scientists to understand research and extension activities. He also interacted with farmers and incubatees who have benenfited from IIHR technologies. He also interacted with directors of the ICAR institutes located in Bengaluru.

Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy clarified that the government was neither considering abolishing any existing district nor creating new districts at this stage, and asked the people not to fall for the scare being generated by the Bharat Rashtra Samiti (BRS).
Mr. Reddy strongly objected to what he described as “false propaganda” being spread by the BRS over the reorganisation of districts in Telangana. He categorically denied claims that the Bhupalpally district was being abolished, asserting that there was no such proposal before the government. The BRS was deliberately misleading the public by circulating rumours.
The Chief Minister said any future discussion on district reorganisation would be taken up only after seeking the opinions of all stakeholders and the Opposition parties, and holding a detailed debate in the State Assembly. He cautioned people against falling prey to what he termed the Opposition party’s “conspiracy politics” aimed at gaining political mileage through misinformation.
Mr. Reddy also rebutted allegations made by the BRS on Singareni Collieries issues and clarified that the medical unfit board would be removed. He assured that recruitment on compassionate grounds in Singareni would continue without interruption. Further, the government would take steps to resolve the long-pending issue of 217 dismissed Singareni workers, the Chief Minister said, reiterating his government’s commitment to protecting workers’ interests.

Asaduddin Owaisi
All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) president Asaduddin Owaisi criticised Karimnagar MP Bandi Sanjay Kumar, questioning the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s nationalism claims over reduced Russian oil procurement, and said a vote for Bharat Rashtra Samithi would help the BJP.
Mr. Owaisi was addressing a public meeting in Karimnagar, where the party has fielded 15 candidates for the upcoming municipal elections. He said the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh must explain their silence after the USA reportedly warned of reimposing 25% ad valorem duty if India continued to buy Russian oil, directly or indirectly.
He sought to know where the BJP’s nationalism was when a “white-skinned” foreign leader was issuing threats over India’s sovereign economic decisions. He claimed that India had reduced Russian oil imports while China benefited by buying cheaper crude oil.
Turning to local issues, Mr. Owaisi said that despite Karimnagar being listed as a Smart City, basic infrastructure such as roads, drainage and electricity remained inadequate, with Muslim localities especially neglected. He also alleged that, at the behest of the local MLA, 25 houses were demolished overnight in the city.
Taking a dig at Karimnagar legislator Gangula Kamalakar, Mr.Owaisi said the latter had retained his Assembly seat earlier only because of the AIMIM’s support. He warned that after the elections, the legislator would gravitate towards the BJP and asserted that a vote for the BRS in Karimnagar would effectively aid the BJP. He appealed to voters not to back such candidates, describing it a waste of their mandate.
Mr.Owaisi also urged mosque committees and Muslim scholars to speak out against the Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls. He alleged that the BJP intended to harass and disenfranchise Muslims not through the Citizenship Amendment Act, NRC or NPR, but through the SIR process.

Several irrigation projects in Karnataka have either stalled or slowed down owing to inaction by the Union government, said Chief Minister Siddaramaiah at Siraguppi village in Dharwad district on February 8.
He was speaking at the launch of several development works in Navalgund Assembly constituency, including a restraining wall to control floods in Bennihalla. The event was organised by the Water Resources Department and Karnataka Irrigation Corporation Limited. The flood control infrastructure will cost an estimated ₹200 crore in the first phase. The Chief Minister launched around 72 development works at the cost of ₹150 crore.
“The third phase of the Krishna Upper River Project has been stalled by the Union government. We have urged the Union Ministers concerned to issue a gazette notification that can enable us to start work, but in vain. Similarly, the Union government is yet to provide the necessary clearances to the Kalasa Banduri Nala project. The Central Wildlife Board is yet to approve our application, though the other departments have issued clearances and the Supreme Court approved the project in 2018. If all permissions are obtained, the work can start tomorrow itself,” the Chief Minister said.
On the Mekedatu drinking water project, Mr. Siddarmaiah said the project involves the usage of 65 tmcft of water. But it is stuck as the Union government is yet to clear the State’s proposals. The courts have already dismissed objections filed by Tamil Nadu, he added.
“The Upper Bhadra River project was considered a project of national importance in the Union Budget. The Centre promised to release ₹5,300 crore for the same, but no money has been released so far,’’ the Chief Minister pointed out.
“Some people are going around saying that the Karnataka government is not taking up development works as it has exhausted resources on guarantee schemes. That is far from the truth,” Mr. Siddaramaiah stated.
He added that several development works are under way across the State. “For example, we have taken all necessary steps to start work on the Kalasa Banduri Nala project. Since the Supreme Court approved the project, we called and finalised tenders and fixed the agency. However, work is yet to begin as we have not received the necessary clearances from the Union government,’’ the Chief Minister said, adding that “our government has spent around ₹25,000 crore on irrigation projects since coming to power’’.
He said that the Union government is collecting ₹4–5 lakh crore in taxes from Karnataka, but is releasing grants of only around ₹60,000 crore. “We have raised our objections against this,’’ he noted.
The Chief Minister criticised the BJP-led NDA government for introducing the VB-G RAM G scheme after making several changes to the MGNREGA Act. “For two decades, this scheme provided livelihood to rural folk, reduced distress migration to cities, and ended starvation deaths,” he added.
A look at the beneficiary statistics of MGNREGA reveals that 53% of beneficiaries were women. Out of the total beneficiaries, 28% are from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes — 17% and 11%, respectively. “The welfare scheme that aimed to provide jobs to the youth, women, and the unemployed has been abandoned. It is extremely unfortunate. However, we will not keep quiet. We will fight against this. We will fight to re-establish the MGNREGA scheme,” Mr. Siddaramaiah stated.
He said he is committed to making Navalgund a model constituency. “Several development works have been launched in the constituency. There are demands to build an underground drainage system in Annigeri town. It will be discussed before the Budget,” the Chief Minister noted, adding that the ₹200-crore flood prevention project was taken up at the insistence of N.H. Konaraddi, MLA.
Earlier, an estimated cost report of ₹1,610 crore was submitted to the Union government. “But since the Centre delayed approvals, we decided to take up the first phase at a cost of ₹200 crore. Due to the flash floods in the stream, about 37 villages and 20,000 hectares of land were flooded. This will be avoided by the restraining wall and other structures,’’ the Chief Minister said.
Mr. Siddaramaiah said he is a believer in Basavanna’s ideology of “inclusive and not othering”. We are running a welfare state. We have spent around ₹1.16 lakh crore on the five guarantee schemes. About ₹54,000 crore is used annually for the guarantee project. On an average, ₹4,000–5,000 is given to every family each month, or around ₹50,000 per year in direct benefits, he said.
Ministers H.K. Patil, Satish Jarkiholi, Santosh Lad, Prasad Abbayya, MLA, Salim Ahmed and F.H. Jakkappanavar, MLCs, leaders Shakir Sanadi and S.R. Patil, I.G. Sanadi, former MP, A.H. Hindasgeri, former Minister, Kusumavati Shivalli, former MLA, and others were present.

Jan Suraaj founder Prashant Kishor on Sunday (February 8, 2026) launched the ‘Bihar Navnirman Yatra’ from West Champaran district, saying the campaign would focus on rebuilding and strengthening the organisation across the State.
Despite attracting significant public attention, Jan Suraaj failed to win a single seat in the 2025 Bihar Assembly elections, where it contested 238 seats.
Talking to reporters in Bettiah, Mr. Kishor said, “The yatra will focus on rebuilding and strengthening the party’s organisation across the State to present an honest and accountable political alternative in Bihar.”
He asserted that the party has remained active among the people even after the Assembly elections, and the yatra will now help it expand and reorganise its grassroots network at the district level.
“To ensure that our Bihar Navnirman Abhiyan materialises seamlessly on the ground, I will spend some time in each district and meet old associates and new aspiring ones to strengthen the party’s organisational structure,” Mr. Kishor said.
Mr. Kishor asserted that during his yatra, the party will address the issue of a poll promise related to financial assistance for women under the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rozgar Yojana.
Under the programme, the State Government transferred ₹10,000 each to 1.56 crore women in Bihar in multiple phases, with a major proportion receiving the funds before the polls. The government had announced that the beneficiaries will later be provided up to ₹2 lakh each to build on their businesses.
“Jan Suraj workers would reach households across the district to ensure that the benefit is delivered to women. Government’s failure to fulfil the commitment would indicate that the announcement was made only for electoral gains,” Mr. Kishor claimed.
Notably, the Bihar Government, in its cabinet meeting on January 29, had decided to provide the additional financial assistance of up to ₹2 lakh to selected beneficiaries of the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rozgar Yojana after an assessment period of six months.
“The amount will be given in phases to the women entrepreneurs who will properly utilise the ₹10,000 fund at the end of the assessment period,” a statement issued by the government noted.

--------------------
A day after admitting to receiving funds from the proprietor of the Nedumparambil Credit Syndicate (NCS), Pathanamthitta MP Anto Antony on Sunday found himself at the centre of a political storm over alleged opaque election funding.
The Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] has seized on the admission by the Congress MP to mount a direct challenge, preparing to move the Election Commission on the charge that Mr. Antony failed to disclose the receipt of campaign funds in his official expenditure statement.
Speaking to mediapersons here on Sunday, Health Minister Veena George, who lost to Mr. Antony in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, sharpened the attack by publicly questioning the scale and source of his campaign finances. “Did he actually spend ₹2 crore during the election? Did he disclose the receipt of this fund to the Election Commission and while submitting his annual income tax returns?” Ms. George asked.
K.P. Udayabhanu, a CPI(M) State committee member and the first to raise allegations of financial fraud against the Pathanamthitta MP, went a step further by demanding a detailed probe into alleged land transactions involving Mr. Antony in Bengaluru. He also wanted the Special Investigation Team probing the Sabarimala gold scandal to examine Mr. Antony’s financial transactions in Bengaluru.
The Enforcement Directorate, which is probing alleged money laundering by the non-banking financial company, too has included this aspect within the scope of its investigation.
Mr. Antony, however, declined to respond to media queries on the controversy. Earlier, he had acknowledged receiving funds from N.M. Raju, the NCS proprietor, to finance his election campaign and claimed that the amount was repaid within two months. He, however, has refused to disclose the amount actually received from this source, fuelling speculation. Mr. Raju, on the other hand, has maintained that the MP received the money without any documentation and is yet to repay the amount.

Digi Kerala 2.0, the second phase of the State government’s digital literacy programme, is set to be launched with focus on cyber security, artificial intelligence (AI) awareness, training for using the Local Self-Government department’s K-SMART application, and digitisation of basic documents.
On August 21, 2025, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had declared Kerala as the first fully digitally literate State in India, marking the completion of the first phase of the Digi Kerala project, a grassroot-level intervention across all local bodies to bridge the digital divide. In the first phase, as many as 21.87 lakh people were trained in the usage of digital devices for basic purposes.
One of the major focus areas of the second phase of the project is cyber security, considering the increasing number of cyber fraud cases in recent times. People will be trained to identify various threats hidden in online spaces and the possible ways in which fraudulent operatives target victims. Added to this, the focus on AI awareness will help the trainees not only to get an idea of the possibilities of AI and its responsible use, but also to identify AI-generated content which is often used on online platforms to propagate fake narratives.
The State government had in 2024 launched the K-SMART application to make available services of local self-government bodies digitally over a uniform platform. Services including building permit applications, civil registration applications, trade licenses, and grievance redressal are now being delivered through K-SMART.
Minister for Local Self-Governments M.B. Rajesh had said during the first phase of the project that it was part of the government’s long-term plan to equip all sections of the population with the knowledge of accessing digital services after it made available most of its services online through the K-SMART platform.
After undergoing training under Digi Kerala 2.0, the trainees will be able to use K-SMART without approaching help desks or third parties. The trainees will also be equipped to use the DigiLocker service to digitise all basic documents.

The Transport Department on Sunday stated that it would implement the Rah-Veer scheme across the State to encourage citizens to provide immediate assistance to road accident victims and help reduce fatalities. The move entails a cash incentive of ₹25,000 to those who save lives.
According to the scheme, people who come forward as “Good Samaritans “ and help save the life of an accident victim will be recognised and rewarded by the government. They will be called Rah-Veers and apart from the cash incentive, they will be given a certificate of appreciation.
The department said a circular had been issued to all District Collectors to constitute district-level committees so as to lay down the procedure for selection and ensure wide publicity of the initiative. Details of those who provide immediate assistance and shift victims to hospitals will be recorded by the police and hospital authorities, following which cases will be recommended to the district committee for scrutiny.
These committees will be headed by the concerned District Collector. They will forward approved names to the Transport Commissioner for release of the incentive.

With a focus on enhancing defence cooperation, Greek Defence Minister Nikos Dendias and Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh will hold a bilateral meeting on Monday (February 9, 2026) at the Manekshaw Centre in New Delhi.
The discussions are expected to focus on enhancing cooperation in the defence sector, a senior Defence official said.
Speaking at the India-EU Forum 2026 on Saturday (February 7, 2026), Mr. Dendias described India as an indispensable partner for Europe, highlighting New Delhi’s growing strategic and economic importance for the European Union and Greece in particular. He noted that European perceptions of India have evolved significantly over time, adding that India is now viewed as a “necessary-to-have” partner.
Defence ties between India and Greece have seen steady momentum in recent months. In January this year, the two countries held the inaugural India-Greece Joint Services Staff Talks in New Delhi, marking a step towards institutionalising defence cooperation.
Earlier, in September 2025, the Indian Navy and the Hellenic Navy conducted their maiden bilateral maritime exercise in the Mediterranean Sea. The exercise, which concluded on September 18, 2025, was carried out in two phases, a harbour phase at Salamis Naval Base from 13 to 17 September, followed by a sea phase on 17 and 18 September. The Indian Navy was represented by the guided missile stealth frigate INS Trikand.
The upcoming ministerial talks are expected to further consolidate the growing defence partnership between the two countries.

TITLE: ‘Kerala Will See Change’: Amit Shah Slams ‘Failed Development’ Under Communists Ahead Of Polls

--------------------
With months left for the Kerala Assembly elections, Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday criticised the communist government in the state and said India must move away from communist ideology. He said Kerala would soon see change.
Speaking at an event titled ‘Chhattisgarh@25: Shifting The Lens’, the Union Home Minister said the government intends to completely eliminate Maoist influence and urged people to recognise what he described as the damaging effects of communist ideology.
According to him, regions under communist rule have lagged in development. He also alleged that, in the name of tribal welfare, people were pushed towards armed activity, calling the ideology destructive in nature.
Shah said, “We will uproot the Maoist problem from its roots. But the public of this country must understand this ideology. Wherever communist rule has existed, development has failed to take place. In the name of tribal welfare, people were instead handed weapons. This ideology itself is a symbol of destruction."
He added that communists barely exist today. “Today, communists have to be searched for with a telescope- they barely exist anymore. Only Kerala remains, and this time that too will come to an end. The people themselves will do it. The people of Thiruvananthapuram have already begun," he said.
Shah also appealed to Maoists to surrender and said the government would welcome them. He said the country needs to get rid of the “destructive" communist ideology at the earliest.

TITLE: After Poll Setback, Prashant Kishor Launches ‘Bihar Navnirman Yatra’ To Rebuild Jan Suraaj
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/after-poll-setback-prashant-kishor-launches-bihar-navnirman-yatra-to-rebuild-jan-suraaj-ws-l-9888664.html
--------------------
Jan Suraaj founder Prashant Kishor on Sunday launched the ‘Bihar Navnirman Yatra’ from West Champaran, saying the campaign aims to rebuild and strengthen the organisation across the state.
Even after attracting significant public attention, Jan Suraaj failed to win a single seat in the 2025 Bihar Assembly elections, where it contested 238 seats.
After launching the yatra, Kishor said, “The yatra will focus on rebuilding and strengthening the party’s organisation across the state to present an honest and accountable political alternative in Bihar."
He said the party has continued its engagement with the public even after the Assembly elections and that the yatra will help expand and reorganise its grassroots network at the district level.
“To ensure that our Bihar Navnirman Abhiyan materialises seamlessly on the ground, I will spend some time in each district, and meet old associates and new aspiring ones to strengthen the party’s organisational structure," Kishor said.
He said that during his yatra, the party will address the issue of a poll promise related to financial assistance for women under the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rozgar Yojana.
Under the scheme, the state government transferred Rs 10,000 each to 1.56 crore women in Bihar in multiple phases, with a large number receiving the amount ahead of the elections. The government has said the beneficiaries will later be eligible to receive up to Rs 2 lakh each to expand their businesses.
“Jan Suraj workers would reach households across the district to ensure that the benefit is delivered to women. Government’s failure to fulfil the commitment would indicate that the announcement was made only for electoral gains," Kishor claimed.
The Bihar cabinet on January 29 cleared up to Rs 2 lakh in additional assistance for selected beneficiaries of the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rozgar Yojana after a six-month review.
“The amount will be given in phases to the women entrepreneurs who will properly utilise the Rs 10,000 fund at the end of the assessment period," a statement issued by the government noted.

--------------------
Chief Minister Rekha Gupta said that the Delhi government on Sunday launched 500 electric buses, taking the total EV fleet of the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) to 4,286.
She attended the launch of 500 EV buses and the Delhi–Panipat inter-state bus service at Ramlila Maidan.
Rekha Gupta said that Ramlila Maidan symbolises a turning point in Delhi’s political history, recalling how previous governments had “deceived the people and betrayed their trust" at the same venue. She added that it was now through Ramlila Maidan that her government had earned the confidence of Delhi’s citizens and presented them with a promise of development.

“This step will not only boost transportation and connectivity in the city but also help in cutting down air pollution," Gupta said at the launch event which was also attended by BJP president Nitin Nabin.
She said by 2028, the DTC plans to increase its total bus fleet to 14,000. “These EV buses will help improving the air quality and the transport needs of the city. These are AC buses, low-floor with panic buttons and several other features," she added.
Transport Minister Pankaj Singh said that three inter-state bus services connecting Delhi and Panipat have also been launched.
“Delhi government is constantly working on the transport sector. One such measure is providing last mile connectivity to residents. We have recently signed an MoU with Bharat Taxi in this regard and soon a new EV policy and an E-rickshaw policy will also be in place," the chief minister said.
Delhi Minister Parvesh Verma on Sunday spoke about the launch of 500 electric buses and the Delhi–Panipat inter-state bus service at Ramlila Maidan, saying the developments marked the beginning of a larger transformation.
He said the initiatives were “just the trailer" and that the “full picture is yet to come," recalling that exactly one year ago the people of Delhi had given the Bharatiya Janata Party 48 seats.
Thanking the public for their support, Verma added that several projects had already been initiated and many more would be rolled out in the coming months.

TITLE: ‘Not Surrender, It’s Negotiation’: Pakistani Analyst Decodes India-US Trade Agreement | Exclusive
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/not-surrender-its-negotiation-pakistani-analyst-decodes-india-us-trade-agreement-exclusive-ws-l-9888326.html
--------------------
Pakistani analyst Najam Sethi called the India-US interim trade agreement “a negotiation".
“It is not a surrender. It is a negotiation. These decisions don’t happen overnight. The negotiations must have gone on for months. PM Modi was quiet throughout," said Sethi.
“It is not zero tariff on all items…It includes items that are no threat to Indian industries," he said
The analyst said PM Modi negotiated smartly while the Indian opposition is creating unnecessary fuss. Sethi said that India’s zero-tariff concessions apply only to a small, specific list of US items such as certain wines, cosmetics, soybean oil, tree nuts, and processed fruits, not a broad flood of goods These reductions cover very few products and won’t significantly hurt domestic sectors or undermine Make in India, as the deal protects sensitive areas like dairy, grains, and key agriculture, he said.
Many in Pakistan, including analysts like Sethi, see this as a smart bargain by Modi and India gains better access without losing much, making the opposition’s noise seem unnecessary and politically motivated.
Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal on Saturday underlined the government’s commitment to farmers while concluding the framework of the bilateral trade agreement with the US. In his statement, the Minister said that dairy, fruits, vegetables, spices, and other grains have been protected in the India-US trade deal to safeguard the interests of domestic farmers.
In a post on X, Piyush Goyal said the trade deal will mark a powerful step forward in the direction of a self-reliant India.
“Farmers Safe, Country Developed… In the India-US trade agreement, dairy, fruits, vegetables, spices, and other grains have been protected. This will safeguard the interests of domestic farmers, strengthen local agriculture through preferential access to such a large market, and mark another powerful step forward in the direction of a self-reliant India," he said.
Both India & US are working to create resilient supply chains for an uninterrupted supply of critical minerals to support industries.#IndiaUSJointStatement pic.twitter.com/urzZFtZF3S— Piyush Goyal (@PiyushGoyal) February 7, 2026
“India is not losing anything in trade deal and even Pakistani voices have openly admitted that India lost nothing but only the Indian opposition spreading fear. Domestic political outrage is not linked from actual economic impact and the opposition is creating anxiety unnecessarily," said Indian government sources.
Pakistani commentators see continuity in India’s trade posture and they also feel it was India’s calculated move without losing anything.

Currently, Karnataka is served by 22 Vande Bharat services (11 pairs), operating on both originating and terminating routes, which connect multiple cities across the state. Of these, 14 services either originate from or terminate in the Bengaluru region, highlighting the city’s role as a major rail hub.
The proposed new service will run on the Bengaluru–Mangaluru route and is expected to significantly cut travel time between the state capital and the coastal city.
Addressing a press conference in Bengaluru on Saturday, Union Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the service would be launched once key preparatory work is completed.
“A new Vande Bharat service connecting Bengaluru and Mangaluru will be launched soon after the completion of electrification and safety certifications," Vaishnaw said.
The minister added that Karnataka is witnessing major upgrades in railway infrastructure, noting that a record ₹7,748 crore has been allocated for the state’s rail sector.
The upcoming Vande Bharat Express is expected to be equipped with several advanced safety and comfort features, including:
Once operational, the new Bengaluru–Mangaluru Vande Bharat is expected to modernise rail travel in Karnataka further and improve connectivity between the state’s interior and its coastal belt.

TITLE: IWT Paused, Infra Fast-Tracked, Pakistan Irked: A Look At India’s Projects On Chenab
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/iwt-paused-infra-fast-tracked-pakistan-irked-a-look-at-indias-projects-on-chenab-ws-kl-9888041.html
--------------------
As India placed the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) in abeyance in April 2025 following the Pahalgam attack, it has shifted from a policy of “restraint" to one of “strategic execution".
By treating the treaty as suspended, India is no longer following data-sharing or prior-notification requirements with Pakistan for new or existing projects on the Chenab River.
The IWT is a landmark water-sharing agreement signed on September 19, 1960 between India and Pakistan, brokered by the World Bank. It established a framework for managing and distributing the waters of the Indus River system, which has remained largely functional despite decades of regional conflict.
The treaty divides the six major rivers of the Indus basin into two groups:
Eastern Rivers (Ravi, Beas, Sutlej): Allocated to India for unrestricted use.
Western Rivers (Indus, Jhelum, Chenab): Allocated to Pakistan.
India is permitted limited “non-consumptive" use of these rivers for domestic, agricultural, and run-of-the-river hydroelectric power generation, provided it follows strict design specifications to avoid harming Pakistan’s interests.
It provides for a Permanent Indus Commission (PIC), abilateral body with a commissioner from each country tasked with data exchange, annual meetings, and initial conflict resolution. In case of disputes, it has a three-tiered mechanism starting with the PIC, followed by a Neutral Expert for technical issues, and finally an ad-hoc Court of Arbitration for major disputes.
As India held the IWT in abeyance, it has halted meetings of the Permanent Indus Commission and fast-tracked projects on western rivers (like Ratle and Pakal Dul) without the previously required technical notifications to Pakistan.
It has also rejected rulings from the Court of Arbitration, which India currently labels as “illegal."
Sawalkote HEP (1,856 MW): This is the first major new project to receive a “green light" post-IWT halt. On February 5, 2026, NHPC invited international tenders worth ₹5,129 crore for its construction. It has been designated a “Project of National Importance" and will be the largest in J&K once completed (estimated 9-year timeline).
Dulhasti Stage-II (260 MW): Approved by a Ministry of Environment panel in December 2025. This project is an extension of the existing Stage-I and was cleared specifically under the logic that IWT notification requirements are currently void.
Pakal Dul HEP (1,000 MW): Being fast-tracked for a “non-negotiable" commissioning deadline of December 2026. Crucially, this is India’s first storage project on a western river, giving it the ability to regulate water flow timing into Pakistan.
Kiru (624 MW) & Kwar (540 MW): Both are run-of-the-river projects being accelerated. Kiru is targeted for December 2026, while Kwar is now set for March 2028.
Ratle HEP (850 MW): Long-contested by Pakistan, this project’s construction is now being treated as a sovereign decision. It is being fast-tracked for a 2028 completion.
India has initiated desilting and reservoir enhancement at the Salal and Baglihar projects to improve storage and power generation, activities previously restricted by the treaty.
Since the halt, India has reportedly restricted or fluctuated water flows from existing dams like Baglihar and Salal. In May 2025, downstream flows at Pakistan’s Marala headworks reportedly dropped by up to 90% during maintenance operations.
In June 2025, India initiated a feasibility study for a 113-km canal to divert surplus water from the Chenab basin in J&K toward the Ravi and Beas systems in Punjab and Rajasthan.

--------------------
A top Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) source has confirmed that actor-turned-politician and party chief Vijay is likely to contest from two seats in the Tamil Nadu 2026 assembly elections.
According to the sources, Vijay has finalised Virugambakkam constituency in Chennai as his electoral battleground. The actor-turned-politician is also expected to file his nomination from Trichy East, signaling a strategic push to expand his party’s presence across key urban and regional strongholds.
The confirmation comes amid widespread speculation about the actor’s political debut at the state level.
Earlier, Vijay stated that his party, the TVK, has emerged as a major political force with the backing of the people and claimed it is the only party capable of defeating the DMK in the upcoming elections.
Vijay dismissed speculations of a triangular or multi-cornered contest, stating that the true electoral battle would be a straight fight between the TVK and the ruling DMK, which he confidently predicted would face defeat.
“People talk about triangular or four-corner contests. One is represented by the TVK backed by the people, the second is DMK, and the third is BJP and its many allies. Only the TVK, which is a people’s force alone can defeat the DMK," he added.

TITLE: BJP's Devyani Rana Slams J&K Budget In Maiden Assembly Speech, Yet Wins NC Applause
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/bjps-devyani-rana-slams-jk-budget-in-maiden-assembly-speech-yet-wins-nc-applause-9887959.html
--------------------
BJP MLA Devyani Rana made a strong impression in her maiden speech in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly on Saturday, launching a pointed critique of the Union Territory’s budget while drawing rare applause from members of the ruling National Conference (NC).
As Rana rose to speak on the budget presented by Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, NC legislators were seen thumping their desks in encouragement, a gesture that was repeated at the end of her address, despite her sharp criticism of the government’s financial priorities.
Ahead of the speech, Speaker Abdul Rahim Rather urged members to support the first-time legislator, who won the recent by-election from Nagrota following the death of her father, senior political leader Davinder Singh Rana.
Davinder Singh Rana, once a prominent NC leader and close associate of Omar Abdullah, had joined the BJP a few years ago, a move the chief minister has publicly described as one of his biggest political regrets.
Following Rana’s death after the October 2024 Assembly elections, Abdullah had delivered an emotional tribute in the House, recalling their long association.
Reflecting this personal history, the NC had mounted only a symbolic contest against Devyani Rana in the Nagrota by-election, with Abdullah notably refraining from criticising her during campaigning.
On Friday, Abdullah, who also holds the finance portfolio, presented a Rs 1.13 lakh crore budget for Jammu and Kashmir. A day later, the House listened in near silence as Devyani Rana delivered a detailed, data-backed critique of the proposals.
In her 12-minute address, Rana questioned reduced allocations across several critical sectors, including disaster management, education and welfare schemes.
She highlighted that funding for disaster management and relief had been cut to Rs 350.76 crore from Rs 719 crore in the previous year.
She argued that such a reduction was particularly troubling in light of recent natural disasters.
“This contraction comes in a year marked by unprecedented and relentless rainfall that caused severe destruction, especially in rural areas like Nagrota," Rana said, recalling the flash floods, landslides and cloudbursts that hit Jammu and Kashmir last August and September, claiming dozens of lives and leaving hundreds of families homeless.
More than 100 pilgrims were killed in landslides during the Vaishno Devi and Machail Yatra in Kishtwar.
Rana called for enhanced investment in disaster mitigation and relief, saying it should have been a central focus of the budget. She also criticised cuts in the education sector, warning of their long-term social impact.
“If we spend Rs 193 crore less on education than last year, schools will be shut or merged. How will the child of a poor family move ahead?" she asked.
The BJP legislator further flagged gaps in welfare implementation, citing the free bus service for persons with disabilities, which she said lacked vehicles equipped with disabled-friendly infrastructure.
Despite her pointed attack on the government’s budget and policies, Rana concluded her speech to applause from both treasury and opposition benches, an unusual moment of bipartisan appreciation in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly.

Though the Department of School Education and Literacy (DSEL) has been running a ‘Government School and Educational Institutions Property Protection Campaign’ for the last three years to protect the properties of government schools, it has been found that  18,791 government schools across the State do not have any land records.
The government has now taken steps to bring “The Karnataka School Education Department Properties Protection Bill 2025, or The Karnataka Protection of Government School/Colleges Properties Bill”  to register the properties of government schools in the name of the DSEL.
Responding to a question raised by expelled BJP member Basanagouda R. Patil Yatnal in the recent session, School Education Minister Madhu Bangarappa said the properties of 17,356 government primary schools and 1,435 high schools across the State were not registered in the name of the department and don’t have revenue documents. “Therefore, the proposal to enact a separate bill related to the registration of these properties is under review,” he said.
There are currently 48,436 government schools in the State, including 43,564 primary and 4,872 high schools. Most of these schools have been allotted land by the government, while many donors have donated land and sites to many schools.
However, out of these, a total of 18,791 government school lands and sites have not been registered in the name of the DSEL and do not have any other revenue records, including khata extracts. As a result, many school lands have been encroached upon and cases have also been registered in the court. In addition, it has also become difficult to undertake school development work, including building construction, without the necessary documents.
The DSEL has been conducting government School and Educational Institutions Property Protection Campaign every year since 2022-23.
The Deputy Commissioners had been instructed to collect the land records of the respective government schools and register them in the name of the school, and if the said lands were encroached upon, they should have the lands surveyed by the authority concerned and remove the encroachment.
However, so far only 25,339 primary and 3,437 high schools have been registered in the name of the DSEL.
Shivamogga, the in charge district of Minister for School Education Madhu Bangarappa, has the highest number of pending registration of government school properties, with 1,192 schools, followed by 1,124 in Mandya, 1,063 schools in Tumakuru, 958 in Kalaburagi, and 877 in Bengaluru South (earlier Ramanagara) district.
Umesh G. Gangavadi, State president of School Development and Monitoring Committee (SDMC), said, “Most of the properties of government schools have been encroached upon due to the neglect of previous governments. Many cases are pending in court. A few years ago, there was an incident in Kolar where some private individuals took possession of a government school and demolished it on the orders of the court. If there are no records for the properties, it is also difficult to carry out development work in such schools. The government should complete the pending property registration of government schools on a war footing. A request will be made to the Chief Minister in this regard.”

The eight-member committee appointed by the Maharashtra government in 2025 to recommend on the implementation of three-language formula in primary education, submitted its report to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis at the State Secretariat on Monday (February 9, 2026). The committee, headed by economist Narendra Jadhav, gave a 10-minute presentation on it, and also submitted another report on how to introduce Artificial Intelligence and ICT (Information and Communication Technology) in school education from Grade 1.
“I have suggested that the recommendations should be implemented from the coming academic year. The main report about the recommendations on three language formula consists of 65 pages, and 60 pages of annexture. The executive summary of the report is 23 pages. I am not at liberty to discuss our recommendations at this stage. But I will hold a press conference once the report is tabled before the cabinet and once I hear back from them,” Narendra Jadhav told The Hindu on Monday (February 9, 2026).
He also said that supplementary report on the use of AI in primary education was 25 pages long. Except Sadanand More and Bhushan Shukla, all other members of the committee were present during report submission.
“The committee has submitted its report to us. We will discuss it in the cabinet first. We will go over the recommendations and decide if anything needs to be modified. The Cabinet will give its suggestions. We will give a briefing about the contents of the report after that,” Chief Minsiter Devendra Fadnavis said.
Last year, the Maharashtra government had to scrap its decision of implementing three languages in primary education, after there was opposition from all quarters of the society about the compulsion of Hindi in Maharashtra in primary education. Children in the State learn three languages from Grade 5 as per the current education system. The government’s decision to bring the three-language policy in primary education was perceived as an imposition of Hindi.
While educationists had contested the government’s decision on the grounds that it will overburden children in primary education with an additional language when the State education system was not equipped to handle the current subjects in schools due to lack of teachers. Several cultural, social and political organisations had hit the ground against the government against the imposition of Hindi at the cost of Marathi.
Bowing to public pressure, after the government scrapped its decision, it appointed an eight-member committee under Narendra Jadhav to study the matter and to give its recommendations last year. The terms of reference had stated that the committee will study the Raghunath Mashelkar committee report which had advocated three-language policy in primary education, and give its suggestions. The government also said that the committee should look into the broad tenets of the National Education Policy.
Accordingly, amid opposition by several linguists and experts that the committee was being appointed under an economist, and not under a linguist or a specialist in child psychology, the committee had started its functioning. It had engaged with several political leaders and socio-cultural organisations, and held meetings in different parts of the State to gather suggestions. After receiving extensions, the committee submitted its report on Monday (February 10, 2026), a day when the results of the final phase of local body elections were declared.

The Biju Janata Dal (BJD) has accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government of throwing the paddy procurement process in the Kharif season into disarray, leaving thousands of farmers sleepless as they wait to sell their harvest.
In a sharply-worded letter addressed to Chief Minister Mohan Charan Majhi on Monday (February 9, 2026), BJD supremo and former Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik says, “agriculture is the lifeline of Odisha, yet the current Kharif procurement season has become a period of profound struggle for our farmers due to administrative apathy and the blatant violation of promises made to the people.”
“During the 2024 elections, as per Point No. 2 of your Party’s (BJP’s) manifesto, you made solemn commitments to the farming community regarding enhanced minimum support price and stopping of Katni-Chhatni (deduction of paddy on account of fair average quality). However, the ground reality across Mandis tells a story of betrayal,” Mr. Patnaik mentioned in his letter.
“Thousands of farmers are spending sleepless nights under the open sky, guarding their paddy from dew and theft, as the lifting of stocks remains agonisingly slow. The lack of basic facilities, the failure of the token system, and the delay in payment — which was promised within 48 hours through direct benefit transfer but is taking weeks in many cases — have pushed the farmers to the brink of agitation,” the former Chief Minister drew attention to.
“Is it not a failure in fulfilment of electoral promises of BJP? It may be mentioned here that payment to farmers through DBT within 48 hours of procurement was promised in Point-2 of the BJP election manifesto,” he asked.
“Despite repeated assurances of a hassle-free procurement, farmers are being subjected to arbitrary deductions of 5 kg to 7 kg per quintal under the guise of moisture content or poor quality. In many districts, this exploitation is happening in broad daylight, often with the alleged collusion of millers and local officials, forcing farmers into a mutual agreement that robs them of their hard-earned income,” said Mr. Patnaik.
“Your government promised an input subsidy of Rs 800 per quintal to support all farmers. However, the recent decision to cap this subsidy at a maximum of 150 quintals per farmer is a clear breach of trust,” he remarked.
Stating that the combination of Katni Chhatni, the 150-quintal cap, and the slow pace of procurement has created a vacuum being exploited by unscrupulous traders and millers, the former CM said farmers, desperate to clear their debts, are being forced into distress sales far below the MSP.
The BJD supremo demanded lifting of the 150-quintal ceiling on the input subsidy, payment to farmers through DBT within 48 hours of procurement and 100% lifting of paddy lying in the open sky within a fixed 72-hour window.
Reacting to the letter, BJP State president Manmohan Samal said, “during Mr. Patnaik’s regime, the government struggled to give ₹100 input subsidy per quintal, whereas the BJP government is paying ₹800. They are deceiving people with false information out of jealousy.”

A case has been registered against an alleged Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader for beating a woman in Madhya Pradesh’s Sidhi district, police said on Monday (February 9, 2026).
According to the police, the incident took place on Sunday morning (February 8, 2026), around 10.30 a.m. at Bhanwaar village in the Bahri police station area over a vegetable stall.
Sidhi’s Additional Superintendent of Police, Arvind Shrivastava, told The Hindu that an FIR was lodged shortly after the incident against two men — Santosh Pathak and Rahul Dwivedi — who are absconding. The duo has been charged under Sections 296(b), 115(2), and 351(3) of the BNS.
A purported video of the incident has also gone viral on the internet in which Mr. Pathak is seen punching and kicking Hema Singh and beating her with a stick.
Sharing the video on X, the Congress said, “Madhya Pradesh’s Jungle Raj. This is BJP leader Santosh Pathak, who is brutally beating a woman in the middle of the road. On one hand, Narendra Modi pontificates constantly on women’s honour from the election podium; on the other hand, BJP leaders tear women’s honour to shreds.”

“But this isn’t the first time. Such instances are reported constantly; BJP leaders, drunk on power, are seen perpetrating atrocities against women. This is the true nature of the BJP,” the Opposition party said, demanding to know if the BJP government would act against Mr. Pathak.
Mr. Shrivastava, however, denied that the accused was linked to any political party and said that it was a case of “sudden provocation”.
“The FIR was lodged within an hour of the incident. The accused are currently absconding but we have teams looking for them,” he said.
According to the FIR, Ms. Singh alleged that Mr. Dwivedi had threatened her, warning her not to place her stall at the spot, which he claimed belonged to Mr. Pathak. She alleged that Mr. Pathak arrived at the scene, soon after, and the two men began to abuse and assault her.

The Uttar Pradesh Budget Session began on Monday on a stormy note, with Samajwadi Party (SP) legislators staging a protest, highlighting issues such as the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, UGC regulations, inflation, and unemployment.
The uproar began when Governor Anandiben Patel began her address in the House even as the Opposition leaders shouted slogans including “Governor go back”.
After Ms. Patel’s speech, Finance Minister Suresh Khanna presented the government’s Economic Survey, outlining an investment-led growth strategy to position the State as a $1-trillion economy. This is the first time the State has presented a review before tabling the budget.
Speaking to reporters, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said he hoped for constructive discussions to ensure the smooth functioning of the House. “The legislature is an important pillar of democracy. If any member has to raise any issue, then instead of disrupting the proceedings, they can hold a dialogue, because the government believes in dialogue to resolve problems.”
“The Budget for 2026-27 will be presented on February 11. After this, there will be a discussion. The Budget Session will run from February 9-20,” the CM said.
Hitting out at the government, Bahujan Samaj Party president Mayawati claimed that people from all sections of society across the State are distressed due to the Yogi Adityanath government’s “poor” policies.
In an X post, Ms. Mayawati noted that the Governor’s speech didn’t focus on the upliftment of society or the State’s development.
“But above all these, they are worried about their life, property and religion, towards which the Hon’ble Governor should have drawn the attention of the government so that the people of the State as well as the Opposition could have got some assurance,“ the BSP chief stated in the X post.

TITLE: Haryana Oppn. alleges cut in no. of old age pension scheme beneficiaries

--------------------
Politics over the ‘Old Age Samman Allowance Scheme’ in Haryana has heated up with the Opposition parties accusing the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party government of cutting the number of beneficiaries under the scheme in a “well-planned manner”, terming it “attack on the rights and the dignity of the elderly” in the State.
In a battle of political one-upmanship, both the Congress and the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) have announced to hold mass protest demonstrations in Sonipat and Panchkula respectively later this month.
As per the latest figures, 20,05,367 beneficiaries – 10,44,069 men and 9,61,298 women – were paid the monthly ₹3,000 pension in February this year.
Rubbishing the allegations of the Opposition as “baseless” and “an attempt to regain the lost political ground”, Haryana BJP media in-charge Arvind said the old age pension in Haryana was more than in neighbouring Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, ruled by the Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress respectively. “Most importantly, Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini has stated that no one’s pension has been cut,” he asserted.
INLD national president Abhay Chautala claimed that names of more than 75,000 pensioners across the State had been cut. In a video message, he accused the Chief Minister of lying on the issue and gave a call for a State-level protest in Panchkula on February 20. Mr. Chautala also directed the party’s workers and office-bearers to record the videos of those whose pension had been cut and send it directly to the Chief Minister to nail his “lie”.
“[Party founder] Chaudhary Devi Lal had started an old age pension of ₹100 without any conditions, which is equivalent to ₹15,000 today. The Congress party, while in power, tried to cut pensions by imposing certain conditions, but the INLD fought for the respect of the elderly then,” Mr. Chautala said, also accusing the BJP government of not increasing the pension by ₹200 as promised.
Announcing a major protest in Sonipat on February 15, Congress’s Rohtak MP Deepender Hooda said old age pension is not charity. “After the elections, the BJP first cut the ration cards of the poor, and now they are cutting the pensions of the elderly,” he said.
Accusing the BJP of a hatching a conspiracy to dismantle “an excellent and long-standing social welfare scheme”, former Deputy CM and Jannayak Janta Party leader Dushyant Chautala said even if there were minor errors in someone’s documents, the government should rectify them by visiting their homes instead of cutting their pensions.
The old age pension scheme was initially started on April 1, 1964 in undivided Punjab, of which Haryana was a part. The rate of pension, which was ₹15 per month, was increased from time to time. The Haryana government implemented this scheme on November 1, 1966 after its creation and 2,382 beneficiaries were paid the pensions. The old age pension scheme was expanded in 1987 at ₹100 per month for those aged 65 years or more. The State government further enhanced the scheme and introduced ‘Old Age Pension Scheme-1991’, now renamed as Old Age Samman Allowance Scheme. It was implemented from July 1y, 1991 and the age of eligibility was reduced from 65 to 60 years.

Union Minister for Civil Aviation Kinjarapu Rammohan Naidu said on Monday that the Hosur airport project proposal mooted by Tamil Nadu has not been recommended “in order to prioritise defence projects of national importance” executed by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) Airport.
He was responding to a question raised by DMK MP S. Kalyanasundaram in the Rajya Sabha on whether the Centre has examined the Hosur airport proposal sent by the State government and the reasons for the delay in granting in-principle approval, airspace clearance and other such permissions. His party colleague Kanimozhi N.V.N Somu too posed a similar query.
Mr. Naidu said: “In order to prioritise defence projects of national importance, being carried out by HAL Airport and to enable operational preparedness of defence forces, the proposal has not been recommended.”
In November last year, the Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (TIDCO) sent the site-clearance for the Hosur airport. “The proposal was circulated to the Airports Authority of India (AAI), the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and the Ministry of Defence (MoD) for comments/observations,” Mr. Naidu added.
Before that, in June, TIDCO had requested the MoD for airspace relaxation to construct the Hosur airport. When it was rejected, the Tamil Nadu government yet again wrote to the Centre, but it was turned down again in January. Sources said the State government had been drafting a justification for this project and will resubmit the request soon.

The Trinamool Congress on Monday (February 9, 2026) welcomed the intervention of the Supreme Court in the case involving Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in West Bengal and called it a big victory for the State.
The Supreme Court said micro observers appointed by the Election Commission of India (ECI) cannot take decisions and directed the West Bengal government to make Group B officers available for the SIR. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who appeared before the top court in person on February 4, had said that micro observers had been engaged only in West Bengal and not in any other State where the SIR exercise was under way.
The top court has asked the ECI to extend the deadline for the claims-and-objections phase of the West Bengal SIR for a week beyond the current deadline of February 14.
“The Hon’ble Supreme Court has delivered a stinging rebuke to @ECISVEEP’s arbitrary overreach. In unequivocal terms, the Court has ordered that micro-observers can only assist EROs/AEROs and that final authority rests solely with EROs. Further, the Court has directed that 8,505 Bengal officials be tagged to EROs to support the SIR process,” the Trinamool Congress posted on social media.
The ruling party in the State said that the development blew apart the “ECI’s unilateral move to parachute micro-observers exclusively into Bengal, to influence, intimidate, and manipulate the process. That Constitutional vandalism has now been struck down by the highest court of the land. This is a big victory for democracy.”
The SIR exercise is on its last legs in West Bengal. The Chief Electoral Officer West Bengal had earlier sought an extension of seven days for the SIR process. The Trinamool Congress leadership, led by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, has opposed the exercise in the State and has described it as an attempt to remove names of genuine voters from the electoral rolls.
“This is a big victory for democracy. A big victory for Bengal. And a big defeat for those who thought institutions could be weaponised against the people. The fight for citizens’ rights, dignity, and the sanctity of the vote will rage on,” read the Trinamool Congress statement on social media.
Leader of the Opposition in West Bengal Assembly Suvendu Adhikari said it had now been proved that the Trinamool Congress made desperate attempts to remove micro observers.
“The doors that Mamata Banerjee and TMC have opened at the Supreme Court will leave all the responsibility with AERO and EROs if suspicious voters are included in the voter list... As a party and as individual voters, we also have the full right to challenge this after the final voter list is published,” Mr. Adhikari said.
The BJP, which demands “purification” of electoral rolls in the State, said that it would not allow Assembly polls in West Bengal due in next few months unless the SIR was held properly.
In the first draft electoral roll published in December, around 58 lakh voters had been deleted under categories such as death, permanent address shift, and untraceable. There were over 1.36 crore people marked under the ‘logical discrepancy’ category and were sent notices from the CEO office asking them to appear for a hearing.

The results were released by Union Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on February 9, 2026. Picture: vvgnli.gov.in
A survey conducted by the Union Labour Ministry’s research arm, V.V. Giri National Labour Institute, among 5,720 workers and 715 employers has found “a broad-based and constructive acceptance” of the four Labour Codes.
“The overall perception scores indicate that stakeholders view the Labour Codes as a credible and forward-looking reform, reflecting confidence in their long-term relevance despite the acknowledged transitional nature of the current phase,” a report based on the survey said.
The results were released by Union Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Monday (February 9, 2026). Ten Central trade unions have given a call for general strike on February 12 against the implementation of the four Labour Codes.
It added that the Labour Codes are increasingly regarded as a shared institutional framework rather than as a unilateral regulatory intervention. “The study finds a consistently positive assessment of the potential impact of the Labour Codes on working conditions, wages, and income security. Workers perceive that the Codes will lead to improved regulation of working hours, better rest and leave practices, and greater regularity in wage payments,” it added.
Sixty per cent of workers, who participated in the survey, believed that overall working conditions will improve as implementation matures. “In addition, 63% of workers perceive that the provisions will lead to better regulation of working hours, while 60% believe the Codes will improve rest periods and leave practices. Regarding remuneration, 54% of workers believe the Labour Codes will improve the timely payment of wages,” the report said.
Also, 64% of workers believed that the new provisions will improve income security; 76% of employers believed that workforce flexibility is essential for business sustainability, and 64% believed timely wage payment provisions will improve workplace discipline. “Fixed-term employment and adaptable workforce structures are viewed as compatible with business sustainability, particularly in a competitive and evolving economic environment, with 64% of employers stating that fixed-term employment suits their business model,” the report added.
It further said: “71% of employers express confidence that the Labour Codes support women’s participation in employment, while 66% of workers believe that safety, transport, and monitoring requirements will improve protection for women workers.”

Amid a political confrontation between the ruling Congress and the BJP over the proposed hike in Namma Metro fares, Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar on Monday announced that metro fares would be recalculated afresh using the formula followed by the Delhi Metro.
The announcement came a day after the BMRCL put the fare hike, scheduled to come into effect on Monday, on hold following public protests and political pressure.
Mr. Shivakumar asserted that it was the State government that had taken the decision to halt the fare revision, rejecting claims by BJP leaders that the Union government had intervened to stop the hike. Addressing a press conference at Vidhana Soudha, Mr. Shivakumar said, “A letter purportedly sent by the Centre directing BMRCL to defer the fare hike has no legal value.”
“There is no politics on this issue. The Union government has no authority to issue directions or interfere in metro fare matters. I have instructed officials to freshly calculate fares based on the formula followed by the Delhi Metro,” he said.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh held a bilateral meeting with Greece’s Minister of National Defence, Nikolaos-Georgios Dendias, in New Delhi on Monday (February 9, 2026). The meeting focused on strengthening defence cooperation under the India–Greece Strategic Partnership.
According to the Ministry of Defence, both Ministers reiterated that the partnership is rooted in shared values of peace, stability, freedom and mutual respect. They agreed to expand the capacities of their indigenous defence industries by aligning India’s Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative with Greece’s defence reforms under Agenda 2030.
A Joint Declaration of Intent on strengthening defence industrial cooperation was signed, marking the beginning of work on a five-year roadmap. The two sides also exchanged a Bilateral Military Cooperation Plan for 2026, outlining future military engagements between the armed forces of both countries, the Ministry added.
The discussions covered regional peace and security, with both leaders acknowledging the steady deepening of bilateral defence cooperation and strategic ties. Convergence on key maritime issues was highlighted, reflecting the shared outlook of the two ancient seafaring nations.
The Greek side announced the deployment of a Greek International Liaison Officer at the Information Fusion Centre–Indian Ocean Region (IFC-IOR) in Gurugram, underlining enhanced maritime cooperation.
Earlier in the day, Defence Minister Dendias laid a wreath at the National War Memorial and paid homage to fallen soldiers. He also inspected a Tri-Service Guard of Honour at the Manekshaw Centre.
The Hellenic delegation travelled to Bengaluru to visit key defence and industrial establishments and interacted with DPSUs, defence industry representatives, and start-ups in New Delhi. The visit reaffirmed the India–Greece Strategic Partnership, built on long-standing and close ties between the two countries and their peoples.

Kanpur Police on Monday (February 9, 2026) booked pan masala baron K.K. Mishra’s son, Shivam Mishra, in a case of overspeeding of a Lamborghini sports car that rammed into pedestrians and two-wheelers on the VIP Road in Kanpur’s upscale Gwaltoli area, injuring six persons and triggering local outrage.
The First Information Report (FIR) was registered at the Gwaltoli police station under Sections 125 (a & b) (rash or negligent acts endangering human life or personal safety), 281 (rash or negligent driving/riding on a public way that endangers human life or personal safety), and 324 (4) (mischief) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023.
“Necessary action is being taken regarding the road accident that occurred on February 8, 2026, within the jurisdiction of the Gwaltoli police station. The accident occurred with a Lamborghini car. The vehicle struck a parked motorcycle, causing it to be crushed under the vehicle. The motorcycle belonged to a man named Taufiq, who suffered injuries in the arms and legs in the accident. He was taken to a hospital for first aid and released after treatment. The victim came to the police station and submitted a petition, based on which an FIR has been registered. Initially, the case was registered based on the vehicle’s description, as the driver’s name was unknown. The vehicle has been seized,” said Raghubir Lal, Police Commissioner, Kanpur Nagar.
He said preliminary investigations revealed that the vehicle was being driven by Shivam Mishra, son of K.K. Mishra. Following the accident, the driver was extricated from the vehicle by two bouncers present in the vehicle. It was reported that the driver had a medical issue and was also sent for first aid. Now that the driver’s identity had been established, legal action was being taken against him. The vehicle was in police custody and an investigating officer was investigating all aspects. The law applied equally to all. There would be no partiality, and strict action would be taken against those found guilty. If anyone attempted to conceal or mislead facts, legal action would be taken against them as well, said Mr. Raghubir Lal.
At least six persons were injured on Sunday (February 8, 2026) after a speeding Lamborghini, allegedly driven by Shivam, rammed into pedestrians and two-wheelers on the VIP Road in Kanpur’s upscale Gwaltoli area. The car first hit an autorickshaw and then crashed into a parked motorcycle, flinging its rider nearly 10 feet into the air. After the incident, angry locals gathered at the spot and surrounded the car, the locals alleged that private bouncers accompanying the accused tried to push back the crowd and behaved aggressively, escalating tensions.

The Opposition members highlighted issues such as unemployment, sluggish economy, and the impact of the bilateral trade with the United States on the agriculture sector during the debate on the Union Budget in the Rajya Sabha on Monday (February 9, 2026). The BJP said the country signed six trade pacts recently, which is an indication that India is becoming a global hub.
Senior Congress MP P. Chidambaram initiated the debate and termed the Budget as “forgettable”, which had been prepared by “a Finance Minister who forgot her promises made in this House last year.” He attacked the Union Government for not addressing unemployment, particularly among youth.
“Youth unemployment is 15%. Less than 25% of the workforce is in regular employment. There is a shift to self-employment, and more workers are in the agriculture sector than they were four or five years ago,” he said, pointing out the decrease in regular employment in the country. “In a country with 144 crore people, only 195 lakh, that is less than two crore, are employed in a factory. Manufacturing, which is largely factories, is stuck at 16% for many, many years,” he said.
The Prime Minister’s Internship Scheme, announced in the last Budget, could offer 1,65,000 positions, the Congress leader said. “Only 33,000 were accepted. Are there no young men and women to accept an internship in big companies? And of the 33,000 that were accepted, 6,000 left the job. What is wrong with the internship scheme?” he asked and sought an explanation from Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.
On the decrease in capital investment, he said that for almost 12 years, capital investment, gross fixed capital formation, is stuck at 30% of GDP. “Net FDI in 2024-25 collapsed to less than 0.09%. FPIs, [that is] foreign portfolio investors are pulling out. Private investment, although companies are cash rich, is stuck at 22% of GDP. In this situation where neither the public sector nor the private sector nor the foreign investor is investing in India, this government has cut capital expenditure. In the year 2025-26, they have cut capital expenditure by a whopping ₹1,44,376 crore,” he said.
In his speech, senior BJP MP Arun Singh said the whole world was turning towards India. “From credit rating agencies to global institutions, everyone is applauding India’s schemes, policies and systems, and they are seeing that the country is becoming a global hub. As a result of that, within a year, India has inked six pacts,” he said, mentioning the deals signed with Oman, New Zealand, the U.K., the EU, and the U.S. as examples. “The biggest among these deals is the India-U.S. trade deal, which shows India’s power, potential and ability that it is emerging as a global hub,” Mr. Singh said.
DMK MP P. Wilson said the Centre surrendered to the United States, and the entire nation was concerned about the “one-sided” trade deal. India is a proud nation and civilisation. This weaponisation of tariff should (would) have pressurised the government into submission,” he said. Mr. Wilson said the Budget had nothing for Tamil Nadu, which was retorted by Ms. Sitharaman.
Samajwadi Party MP Jaya Bachchan too raised the issue of unemployment, particularly among women. She demanded reforms in the tax structure for the entertainment industry. National Conference MP Chowdry Mohammad Ramzan raised the problems faced by the tourism sector in Jammu and Kashmir. Alleging that the Centre had sacrificed the rights of farmers in front of the United States, senior Congress MP Randeep Singh Surjewala said the Union Government failed to utilise around ₹1.17 lakh crore in six years from 2018-19 to 2023-24. “If we count till 2024-25, ₹1.7 lakh crore has been surrendered,” he said.

The two-year tenure of noted film actor Tamannaah Bhatia as the brand ambassador of the State-owned Karnataka Soaps and Detergents Limited’s (KSDL) to strengthen the market presence its products will commence from Tuesday.
Disclosing this to mediapersons, Minister for Large and Medium Industries M.B. Patil said that on the occasion the iconic heritage product Mysuru Sandal Soap would be relaunched with a refreshed and contemporary look.
The Minister said that KSDL had set a target of scaling up its annual turnover to ₹5,000 crore by 2030. In line with this objective, a comprehensive promotional campaign is being undertaken to reach the youth. Tamannaah Bhatia, who enjoyed considerable star appeal and has over three million followers on social media, had been engaged as part of this strategy. The initiative was expected to help create a strong market for the company’s products, including Mysuru Sandal Soap, in North India as well, he said.
KSDL has a rich legacy spanning over a century. The enterprise was established with the vision of the Maharaja of Mysuru, Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar, the then Dewan M. Visvesvaraya, and industrial chemist S.G. Shastri, popularly known as ‘Soap Shastri’.
The organisation, which was witnessing healthy turnover and profits, recorded an all-time high production last month across its three divisions — soaps, detergents and cosmetics, Mr. Patil explained.
At present, the organisation manufactures a total of 57 premium products, ranging from Mysuru Sandal Soap to packaged drinking water.
He said there was a strong demand for the organisation’s products such as shower gels, talcum powder, hand wash, agarbathis, sambrani, dhoop, Millennium Soap and bathing soaps.
Promotional videos and other campaign material would be released to coincide with the commencement of the brand ambassador’s tenure.
In addition, production units would soon be commissioned in the Vijayapura and Dobbspet industrial areas, with the necessary procedures currently under way. Plans were also in place to double the export turnover, which presently stood at around ₹25 crore to ₹30 crore a year, Mr. Patil said.
Speaking on the occasion, KSDL chairman C.S. Appaji Nadagouda said that production activities were being carried out using existing machinery, without purchasing any new equipment.
To facilitate this, a strict three-shift work system had been implemented. Markets in Europe and West Asia were also being explored, and efforts were under way to ensure that KSDL products reached non-resident Kannadigas as well, he said.
KSDL managing director Prashanth said that the menace of counterfeit Mysuru Sandal Soap had been effectively curbed. While KSDL products were currently more popular in South India, greater emphasis was now being placed on market expansion in regions such as Delhi and Central India. The organisation’s turnover was expected to touch ₹2,000 crore in 2025-26.

--------------------
Warasiguda police arrested three persons on Sunday in connection with an attention diversion theft reported from Lalitha Nagar earlier this month, in which a gold ring was stolen from a retired GST superintendent.
The accused were identified as Subhash Nath, 23, Karan Nath, 21, and Sohan Nath, 23, all natives of Madhya Pradesh. Police said the complainant, Venigalla Ravi, 62, a retired GST superintendent residing in Lalitha Nagar, was cheated on February 5.
According to the police, the incident occurred between 12.15 p.m. and 12.30 p.m. when two of the accused approached Ravi outside his residence, reportedly asking for drinking water. They then persuaded him to hand over a gold ring with a green stone, weighing about five grams, claiming they would perform prayers.
Police said that after taking the ring, one of the accused allegedly swallowed it, following which the two fled the spot and joined a third accomplice waiting nearby in an autorickshaw.
Based on the complaint, the Warasiguda police analysed CCTV footage from the surrounding area and gathered local inputs to trace the suspects. All three accused were later apprehended, and the stolen gold ring was recovered.
Police said the accused had migrated to Hyderabad for livelihood and were staying in makeshift huts near Jalpally Road at Pahadishareef. They allegedly targeted elderly persons by posing as individuals offering spiritual remedies and committing thefts under the pretext of prayers.
The arrests were made by the Warasiguda police crime team under the supervision of senior officers of the Secunderabad zone.

Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar on Monday said the State government has rolled out the GBA afresh to improve governance in the city and is proceeding with elections in line with court verdicts and directions.
Addressing concerns over civic administration, Mr. Shivakumar said the government has undertaken large-scale digitisation of municipal records to plug revenue leakage. This includes scanning of documents and the introduction of the e-Khata system. He said the Cauvery software has been implemented to prevent tax leakage and that records of around 25 lakh properties have been digitised so far, with 9.5 lakh e-Khata documents already issued to property owners.
The Deputy Chief Minister said steps have been taken to ensure transparency and prevent corruption in the system. He added that officials have been instructed to provide access to the application free of cost, noting that several property owners were earlier unaware of details related to their own properties.
Mr. Shivakumar also claimed that the Centre had acknowledged the digitisation efforts, stating that Central government officials had appreciated the implementation, interacted with State officials and issued certificates in recognition of the work done.
On property regularisation, he said the process of converting B-Khata properties to A-Khata has begun, with around 7,000 applications received so far, and more expected in the coming days. A time limit of 15 days has been fixed for completing the conversion process, he added.
Rejecting the  criticism that development initiatives in Bengaluru had slowed down, the Deputy Chief Minister  said several infrastructure works are underway. He said the government is carrying out white-topping of roads across 1,600 km, has taken up street-lighting works and has prioritised traffic improvement measures.

--------------------
A poster of Kochadaiiyaan.
The Madras High Court has directed the producer of Rajinikanth-starrer Kochadaiiyaan to pay ₹2.52 crore, within four weeks, as compensation to an advertising agency that had financed the photorealistic motion capture movie in 2014, or end up serving a six-month simple imprisonment sentence in a cheque bounce case.
Justice Sunder Mohan passed the orders while partly allowing a criminal revision case filed by J. Murali Manohar and his production house, MediaOne Global Entertainment Limited, against the conviction and sentence imposed on them by a metropolitan magistrate in 2021 and confirmed by a city civil court in 2023.
According to the complainant, Abirchand Nahar, of AdBureau Advertising Private Limited, his firm had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with MediaOne Global Entertainment on April 25, 2014 for extending a loan of ₹20 crore for the post-production work on Kochadaiiyaan.
The production house had reportedly told the financier that the sale of the lease rights of the movie for a particular area would fetch nothing less than ₹20 crore, and promised to pay 20% of the sale proceeds or a minimum guaranteed profit of ₹2.40 crore to the financier before selling the rights to any third party.
Accordingly, the ad agency transferred ₹10 crore to the bank account of MediaOne on April 28, 2014. However, in December 2014, a cheque issued by the production house got returned with the endorsement, ‘stop payment by the drawer’, and hence the complaint was filed under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act of 1881.
On December 4, 2021, a metropolitan magistrate in Egmore convicted the producer and sentenced him to six months of imprisonment. Further, the magistrate had directed him to pay a compensation of ₹7.70 crore to the advertising agency or undergo six more months of imprisonment.
The conviction as well as the sentence was confirmed by an Additional City Civil Court on August 4, 2023 and therefore, the producer had approached the High Court by way of the present revision, claiming to have repaid ₹12.75 crore. He also accused the ad agency of having used a cheque given as guarantee at a much later date.
However, after finding several inconsistencies in the version of the complainant and that of the producer, the judge came to the conclusion that there were enough material to rule that the ad agency had lent only ₹10 crore, and that it had been repaid ₹8.74 crore, leaving a balance of ₹1.26 crore.
Observing that the object of Section 138 of the NI Act was essentially to recover the money covered under a cheque, the judge confirmed the conviction imposed on the film producer, but modified the sentence to a fine of ₹2.52 crore (twice the existing liability), which the producer was ordered to pay the ad agency as compensation.
“In default, the second petitioner/second accused (Mr. Manohar) shall undergo simple imprisonment for six months,” the judge said.

Addressing the media in Madhira town on the final day of electioneering for the February 11 civic polls on Monday, Mr. Vikramarka said the Congress government is following a holistic approach to development by according top priority to education, health, power generation, irrigation and other crucial sectors to propel the State on the path of progress. The key portfolios of Municipal Administration and Education are being directly handled by Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy with utmost priority, he added.
The State government sanctioned large-scale Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) across the State to treat sewage. Urban infrastructure development works are under way in various urban local bodies to improve civic amenities, he noted.
The urban local bodies were grossly neglected by the BRS government, he alleged, saying the Congress government, soon after coming to power, laid special focus on developing towns and cities, providing self-employment opportunities to women and youth through skill development initiatives. The ITIs had been upgraded into Advanced Technology Centres, he added.
He said the State government is committed to resolving employees’ issues and is introducing a ₹1 crore accident insurance scheme for employees’ welfare.
Listing out the government flagship schemes, he added that the Congress government is at the forefront of implementing multifarious initiatives to promote women’s economic empowerment, foster entrepreneurship by involving women SHGs in solar power generation among other enterprises.
Mr. Vikramarka said a massive retaining wall is being constructed in Madhira to prevent flood water from entering into the town. Underground drainage and underground power cable works are under way in Madhira.
He said an ambitious project has been designed to explore the tourism potential of Wyra river by developing parks and recreational facilities.

Higher Education Minister R. Bindu has strongly criticised Kerala University Vice Chancellor in-charge Mohanan Kunnummal for allegedly disallowing the conduct of the University Youth Festival.
Speaking to media persons here on Monday, Dr. Bindu said it was unbecoming of a Vice Chancellor to oppose the conduct of such a festival, as arts festivals play a major role in encouraging students’ creativity, leadership skills and organisational abilities. Denying students the opportunity to participate would set a wrong precedent, she cautioned. She added that students should not be denied a chance to compete due to unnecessary disputes.
Referring to the complaint submitted against Syndicate members and Students Federation of India (SFI) activists for allegedly vandalising the Vice Chancellor’s chamber, the Minister accused Prof. Kunnummal of adopting an antagonistic and rigid approach towards the academic community and students. While a healthy coordination between the Vice Chancellor and the Syndicate was essential for the smooth functioning of the university, such cooperation was unfortunately lacking, she said.
The SFI also conducted a day-and-night agitation over the purported denial of allocated funds for the purpose.

Telangana is readying an integrated Logistics Master Plan that will take stock as well as chart the roadmap and a Logistics Policy 2.0 to guide long-term multimodal planning.
Together, they will give wings to the State’s aspirations to emerge as a leading inland cargo and logistics hub. At the heart of the Logistics Policy will be a six-pillar approach — infrastructure and multimodal integration; digital and smart logistics; regulatory simplification; sustainability and green logistics; skill development, including encouraging women in logistics; and investment promotion and innovation. The focus will be on lowering logistics costs and building a resilient and inclusive supply-chain ecosystem, people in the know of the policy initiative the State government is putting together said.
On the Logistics Master Plan, the sources said Telangana aims to become India’s top logistics destinations by 2047 on the back of high-value manufacturing, MSME competitiveness, agri-value chains and nextgeneration e-commerce. The plan will map current and projected freight flows, industrial clusters, consumption centres and export corridors besides enabling demand-driven and future-ready infrastructure creation.
A comprehensive framework based on the mapping outcome will guide a phased development of logistics parks, warehousing zones, and air-cargo facilities, integrated with road, rail, and air networks. Leveraging the strong tech ecosystem of Hyderabad, the government will lay emphasis on automation and adoption of green logistics practices. Logistics will be key to achieving the State’s aspirations to become a $3 trillion economy and form an integral part of Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy’s Telangana Rising 2047 vision.
Only land-locked State in southern India, Telangana wants to turn its central location into a strategic advantage by shaping into an inland logistics and distribution hub. It has already announced intent to develop a dry port near the Regional Ring Road and a 297 km greenfield expressway and rail link connecting the facility to Bandar Port in Machilipatnam, Andhra Pradesh.
The Peri-Urban Region Economy (PURE) region, between existing Outer Ring Road and the upcoming RRR is earmarked for growth corridors in manufacturing, MSME clusters and logistics connecting rural and urban economies. Besides the dry port, the State government is keen on building on existing infrastructure like the logistics parks in Mangalapally and Batasingaram on the outskirts of Hyderabad. The government plans to develop 10–12 more logistics parks, along with dry ports and bonded warehousing zones. The upcoming Mega Multimodal Logistics Park at Manoharabad will integrate road and rail freight services.
The State government wants to integrate air cargo with road and rail networks, along with the redevelopment of Warangal Airport and expansion of regional air connectivity.
The Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA) Hyderabad is already India’s leading air-cargo hubs for pharmaceuticals, Life Sciences, perishables, electronics and other high-value goods.

Reiterating that the State government is in favour of social justice, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said that the government will urge the Union government to increase the percentage of reservation for Scheduled Castes and Tribes based on their population.
He was addressing a large gathering after inaugurating the ‘Sri Maharshi Valmiki Jatre-2026’ at Sri Maharshi Valmiki Valmiki Guru Peetha in Rajanahalli near Harihar on Monday.
The Chief Minister emphasised the need for the oppressed communities, including the Valmiki community, to remember their respective histories. “It is important to know history, as without knowing history, building the future is not possible. Only through education, organisation, and agitation can the oppressed protect their rights. And only through education, the communities can stay away from superstitions and blind faith,” he said.
Mr. Siddaramaiah said that it was education that helped Maharshi Valmiki to author Ramayana. “Vyasa Muni who wrote Mahabharata belonged to the fishing community. The system of four varnas deprived the oppressed of education. It was after Constitution came into existence that equal opportunities were provided. Education helps the oppressed to come to the mainstream, so the government has given importance to education which will empower the oppressed economically, socially and educationally,” he said.
The Chief Minister said that the caste system, created by vested interests, had led to inequalities in society. Only through economic and social empowerment can inequalities be removed, he said.
Basavanna had tried vehemently to alleviate the caste system. However, because of vested interests, the caste system had continued and superstitions had spread.
Mr. Siddaramaiah said that the scheme of providing welfare grants to SC/STs based on their population was first introduced by the State government in 2013 and none of the BJP-ruled states had such a law, which had been upheld by the Supreme Court.
The Chief Minister then listed out the various welfare schemes and measures taken by the State government for the benefit of the oppressed communities. He also promised to fulfilled the demands the communities in a phased manner.
The event was attended by Prasannanand Puri Swami, Vachananand Swami, Ministers Satish Jarkiholi, H.C. Mahadevappa, legislators Yathindra Siddaramaiah, N.Y. Gopalkrishna, Raghu Murthy, and others.

The Chief Minister’s reply has rekindled the hope of establishment of separate university for studying tribal culture.
In fact in 2017, the Department of Kannada and Culture had proposed the tribal university in order to encourage further studies and research on tribal communities and subsequently the State government had asked the Department of Higher Education to initiate the process.
However in December 2022, the Karnataka State Higher Education Council (KSHEC) under Department of Higher Education, rejected the proposal at its general body meeting.
The meeting had favoured offering courses or subjects related to tribal studies at the existing Janapada (Folklore) University and other State-run universities.

--------------------
In a bid to strengthen public transport operations and improve bus ridership across India, a national communications and outreach programme titled Reaching Your Riders (RYR) has been launched. The initiative is being led by GIZ with the support of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA), in collaboration with ITDP India.
Designed as a six-month intervention, the initiative aims to improve how public bus systems communicate and engage with passengers in day-to-day operations. “With ridership gradually recovering in the post-COVID period and bus fleets expanding in several cities, the programme is a timely opportunity to enhance public confidence and increase usage of public transport,” said a release.
Despite the addition of thousands of buses annually, gaps in information dissemination continue to act as barriers for passengers. Manjunath Sekhar, director, Sustainable Urban Mobility, GIZ India, said today’s riders expect real-time information at their fingertips, and knowing when the next bus will arrive has become almost mandatory for new-generation users.
The release further highlighted that bus travel in many Indian cities is often perceived as uncertain and stressful due to poor communication. By improving how agencies interact with riders, the initiative seeks to transform bus services into reliable, trustworthy systems where passengers feel seen, informed and heard.
The programme will be implemented in three phases. The first phase includes a kick-off and assessment of existing communication mechanisms within selected State Transport Undertakings (STUs). The second phase will involve an international exposure visit to study best practices, followed by an application process for pilot implementation. In the third and final phase, four STUs or Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) with the highest potential for improvement will receive technical support to implement pilot projects.

As the woman narrated her health issues, the ward boy allegedly informed her that she was suffering from Polycystic Ovary Disorder (PCOD).
The ward boy then proposed a treatment plan involving a course of five injections, for which he charged the family Rs 15,000, assuring them that he would personally administer the medication.
On February 5, Pashte visited the woman’s home and gave her two injections, the police said.
Shortly after receiving the shots, her condition reportedly worsened rapidly, and she fell unconscious.
The Vashi police station official said that the accused appeared panicked following the woman’s collapse, and allegedly asked the woman’s father to dispose of a bag containing used syringes and other medical waste in the trash.
Family members then rushed the woman to a nearby hospital, where doctors declared her dead nearly two hours later.
The police further said that when confronted by the woman’s relatives, Pashte admitted that he was not a doctor.
According to the official, he confessed to being a ward boy employed at a private nursing home in Andheri in Mumbai and acknowledged that he did not possess any recognised medical qualification or medical certificate.
Following a complaint filed by the family, the police registered a case against Pashte and arrested him on February 6.
The accused was booked under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita on charges including culpable homicide not amounting to murder, cheating by personation and other offences.
Police said an investigation was underway to determine the exact nature of the injections administered to the woman and to establish further circumstances surrounding her death.
Officers were also examining whether the accused had treated other people in a similar manner.

TITLE: 'Not Satisfied With Response': Maithili Thakur Questions Minister Over Condition Of Bihar Hospitals
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/maithili-thakur-questions-bihar-mangal-pandey-over-condition-of-hospitals-need-more-doctors-ws-l-9891333.html
--------------------
BJP MLA Maithili Thakur took on her own party’s Health Minister, Mangal Pandey, in the Bihar assembly over the condition of a government hospital in her Alinagar constituency, saying official records did not reflect what she had personally seen on the ground and urging immediate corrective action.
During Question Hour, Thakur rejected the minister’s written reply that suggested the hospital building was not in a severely bad state and only required repairs.
In her intervention, she told the House, “I am not completely satisfied with the minister’s response, because it states that the building is not in a bad condition, it just needs to be repaired."
“But I myself have gone and seen that the building is in a bad condition," she said.
She went on to describe how limited infrastructure and manpower were affecting patient care, saying, “There is a health care system running in a small room there. There is no MBBS doctor, there were two MBBS doctors there in the past, but not now."
Referring to the reply’s mention of another category of doctor, she added, “It is written in the answer that there is another specialist, to which I agree, but we need two MBBS doctors there."
Framing her remarks, the legislator said, “I am not ordering the minister, I am just making a request to him."
She underlined Pandey’s long association with the health department, noting, “Because I was very young, and since then I have been seeing the health minister as a minister. I have been seeing him working in the health department. So I want him to do it for the benefit of the public, because it is very important."
Stressing the scale of dependence on the facility, Thakur told the House, “Five to seven panchayats depend on this hospital. It is clearly believed that 40,000 to 50,000 people benefit from this hospital."
She also highlighted its strategic location within her constituency, saying, “And this hospital is in the centre of my entire committee, with which the two branches, Ghanshyampur and Alinagar, both can benefit from it."
Concluding her intervention, she urged focused attention on the matter.
“So I would like to request him to pay special attention to this. Thank you."
The episode drew attention because it came from a ruling-party legislator of the Bharatiya Janata Party publicly pressing a senior minister from her own side.
In his response placed before the House, Pandey had maintained that the government was addressing infrastructure concerns, pointing to approvals for new hospital buildings in several areas, ongoing construction at some sites, and a phased plan to repair or renovate facilities identified as extremely dilapidated.

TITLE: 'No Copies Published': Penguin India On Row Over Circulation Of Ex-Army Chief's Pre-Print Book

--------------------
Penguin Random House India has issued a formal clarification on social media platform X, stating that it holds the sole publishing rights for ‘Four Stars of Destiny’, the memoir of former Army chief Manoj Mukund Naravane, and emphasising that the book has not yet been published in any format.
In its post, the publisher said it was responding to “recent public discourse and media reporting" around the alleged circulation of a pre-print version of the manuscript.
“We wish to make it clear that the book has not gone into publication. No copies of the book, in print or digital form, have been published, distributed, sold, or otherwise made available to the public by Penguin Random House India," the company said.
The publisher added that it “shall be exercising remedies available in law against the illegal and unauthorised dissemination of the book," concluding that the note was being issued “to place the publisher’s position on record."

The post comes amid a police investigation into claims that an unpublished version of the memoir is being shared online.
A political fallout was also trigerred and a row erupted after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi attempted to quote from what he described as the pre-print book during his speech in the Lok Sabha on the motion of thanks to the President’s Address, drawing strong objections from treasury benches and repeated adjournments before the motion was eventually adopted by voice vote.
Gandhi was later seen flashing a purported copy of the book in the Parliament complex, and the issue led to major disruptions in the House, culminating in the suspension of eight MPs for the remainder of the Budget session.
The Delhi Police said it had taken cognisance of information circulating on social media platforms and news forums alleging that a pre-print copy of ‘Four Stars of Destiny’ was available without mandatory clearance from relevant authorities.
An official told news agency ANI that on verification, police found that “a PDF copy of a typeset book with the same title, apparently prepared by M/S Penguin Random House India Pvt. Limited, is available on certain websites," and that some online marketing platforms had displayed the finished book cover “as if it is available for purchase."
The Special Cell subsequently registered a case to investigate what was described as a “purported leak/breach of a yet to be approved publication."
“The Delhi Police has taken cognisance of information circulating on social media platforms and online news forums claiming that a pre-print copy of a book titled ‘Four Stars of Destiny’ is being circulated without mandatory clearance from competent authorities," the police statement said.
Police reiterated that the required clearance for publication was still awaited and that the probe would examine how the material surfaced in the public domain.

Penguin Random House India on Monday issued a statement clarifying that the memoir of former Indian Army Chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane, ‘Four Stars of Destiny‘, has not been published, following a Delhi Police FIR over the alleged circulation of the book online.
The publisher said it holds the sole publishing rights for the memoir and stressed that no copies—printed, digital, or otherwise—have been released to the public.
“We wish to make it clear that the book has not gone into publication. No copies of the book – in print or digital form – have been published, distributed, sold, or otherwise made available to the public by Penguin Random House India," the statement said.

The publisher also said it would pursue all legal remedies available against unauthorised dissemination. “Penguin Random House India shall be exercising remedies available in law against the illegal and unauthorised dissemination of the book. This statement is being issued to place the publisher’s position on record," it added.
The FIR comes after reports emerged that a pre-publication version of ‘Four Stars of Destiny‘ was circulating online without the mandatory clearances. Delhi Police said they acted after information surfaced on social media and news forums suggesting the book was being shared before official approval.
During verification, investigators found a PDF version of a typeset book with the same title available on certain websites. Some online platforms were also displaying the finished book cover as if it were available for purchase.
The memoir, written by General Naravane, who served as the 28th Chief of Army Staff from 31 December 2019 to 30 April 2022, is expected to cover his nearly four-decade-long career, from Second Lieutenant to Army Chief.
It reportedly offers insights into key moments, including India’s most serious military standoff with China since 1962.

--------------------
The Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) has issued a public advisory warning residents of rising temperatures across Kerala and urging people to take precautions to avoid heat-related illnesses.
According to the advisory, several parts of the state are experiencing above-normal temperatures, with conditions expected to worsen during peak daytime hours. The authority cautioned that prolonged exposure to heat could lead to dehydration, heat exhaustion and heatstroke, particularly among vulnerable groups such as children, the elderly, outdoor workers and those with pre-existing health conditions.
The KSDMA advised people to avoid direct sunlight between late morning and afternoon, drink plenty of water even if not feeling thirsty, and wear light, loose cotton clothing. Residents have also been asked to limit strenuous physical activity during the hottest parts of the day and ensure proper ventilation indoors.
Special instructions were issued for schools, construction workers and those employed in agriculture and other outdoor occupations. Employers were urged to adjust work timings, provide shaded rest areas and ensure access to drinking water.
The disaster management authority also warned against leaving children or pets inside parked vehicles and advised the public to check on elderly neighbours and those living alone. In case of symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, headaches or confusion, people were asked to seek medical help immediately.
Officials said the situation is being closely monitored and further advisories may be issued depending on how weather conditions evolve in the coming days.

--------------------
Delhi Police on Monday registered a case over the alleged leak of a pre-publication copy of Four Stars of Destiny, the memoir of former Army Chief General Manoj Naravane, after reports surfaced that the book was circulating online without mandatory clearances.
According to the police, they took cognisance of information found on social media platforms and news forums claiming that a pre-print version of the book was in circulation, even though official approval for its publication had not yet been granted by the competent authorities.
During verification, investigators found that a PDF version of a typeset book bearing the same title, apparently prepared by publisher Penguin Random House India Pvt. Ltd., was available on certain websites.
In addition, some online marketing platforms were found displaying the finished book cover as if the title were available for purchase.
In view of the suspected breach and unauthorised circulation of an unpublished work, Delhi Police said a case has been registered with the Special Cell and a detailed investigation is underway to ascertain the source of the leak and the extent of the violation.
Four Stars of Destiny is a memoir chronicling nearly four decades of General Naravane’s service in the Indian Army, tracing his journey from a Second Lieutenant to Chief of the Army Staff.
The book reportedly offers insights into key moments of his career, including India’s most serious military standoff with China since the 1962 conflict.
Penguin Random House India is the publisher of the memoir.
The controversy surrounding the book gained attention during the post-Budget session of Parliament.
As Prime Minister Narendra Modi was set to move the Motion of Thanks on the Union Budget, Lok Sabha proceedings were disrupted after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi read out portions of a magazine article said to be based on General Naravane’s unpublished memoir.
Though Gandhi spoke for only a few minutes, his remarks drew sharp reactions from the BJP leadership.
Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh accused the Leader of the Opposition of citing material from an unpublished book.
Singh questioned the propriety of referring to content that had not formally entered the public domain.
Within days, Gandhi returned to Parliament holding a copy of Four Stars of Destiny, saying he intended to “gift it to the Prime Minister", further fuelling the political controversy.

--------------------
Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar on Monday defended the decision to give cabinet rank to party workers, saying it was a matter of status and recognition for those who helped bring the party to power.
Responding to criticism, Shivakumar questioned what the BJP had done during its time in power and dismissed the objections raised by the opposition.
“They have got us to power, they will get power. It’s about status. More will get it," he said.
Reacting to the move, BJP leader and Chief Whip in the Legislative Council, N Ravikumar criticised the government, saying that the Congress had 139 MLAs but cabinet rank had been given to 150 individuals.
“Some of them are MLAs, some are not. Whoever complained that they did not get cabinet ranks, to appease them, the state government has given them the status. Whose money are they spending on it? It’s the people’s tax money. How can they do this?" Ravikumar said.
He demanded that the Chief Minister release a list of all those given cabinet rank and disclose how much money was being spent on them.
“There is no development in the state. Bengaluru has turned into a pothole city. Funds are not being given to MLAs for development, but they are spending people’s tax money to appease some individuals," he added.
According to details, the Siddaramaiah government has handed out cabinet and minister of state ranks to a total of 149 individuals so far.
This includes 32 full-fledged ministers who are constitutionally appointed cabinet ministers, 43 MLAs granted cabinet rank as chairpersons of various corporations and boards, and 11 MLAs given minister of state status as heads of smaller corporations.
Among non-MLAs, cabinet rank has been granted to nine advisers and special representatives, while minister of state rank has been given to 54 Congress leaders and workers.
Recently, 54 more people serving as heads of boards and corporations were given minister of state status, raising serious questions over the burden on the exchequer.
Those granted cabinet or minister of state rank are entitled to a monthly salary of Rs 50,000, a hospitality allowance of Rs 3,000, daily travel allowance of Rs 2,000 within the state and Rs 2,500 outside the state, and a fuel allowance of 1,000 litres of petrol or diesel per month.
They are also provided house rent allowance of Rs 80,000 per month, house maintenance and staff allowance of Rs 20,000 per month, medical expense reimbursement, and staff facilities including a personal secretary, personal assistants, drivers and an attender.
At government programmes, they are given seating arrangements and protocol equivalent to those of state ministers.

--------------------
Union Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation Amit Shah is set to deliver the keynote address at the National Conference on “Tackling Cyber-Enabled Frauds & Dismantling the Ecosystem" on Tuesday in New Delhi.
According to a PIB press release, at the event, Shah will also preside over an Investiture Ceremony of CBI officers, inaugurate the new Cybercrime Branch of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), and launch the S4C Dashboard under the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C), Ministry of Home Affairs.
The two-day conference, organised by the CBI in collaboration with I4C, Ministry of Home Affairs, will run from February 10 and 11 at Bharat Mandapam in the national capital.
“The conference is being convened at a time when, under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, India’s rapid digital transformation has significantly improved access to banking, governance, and communication, while simultaneously creating new vulnerabilities that are being exploited by organized cybercriminal networks," the release noted.
The CBI has been investigating cybercrime since 2000 and enhanced its capabilities by setting up the Cybercrime Investigation Division in 2022. The agency serves as the nodal body for cybercrime cases affecting the Central Government and its offices, handling both cyber-dependent crimes and cyber-enabled frauds.
The conference aims to build a shared understanding of the scale, trends, and evolving nature of cyber-enabled fraud in India. It will examine three critical pillars of the cyber-fraud ecosystem: the financial pillar (mule accounts and money laundering), the telecom pillar (misuse of SIM/eSIM and digital infrastructure), and the human pillar (cyber slavery and trafficking into scam compounds).
Key objectives include strengthening inter-agency and public–private collaboration among law enforcement, banks, telecom providers, regulators, and technology platforms; exploring the use of artificial intelligence and data analytics to scale investigations; and improving mechanisms for faster fraud reporting, real-time fund tracing, timely evidence preservation, and better victim protection.
Senior officials and experts from Central and State law enforcement agencies, the Department of Telecommunications, Reserve Bank of India, public and private banks, FinTech firms, telecom and social media companies, cybersecurity experts, and international representatives are expected to participate.

--------------------
A case has been registered by Bengaluru police after a pregnant cat was reported missing from a residential neighbourhood, prompting concern among residents and animal welfare supporters. Authorities are investigating the circumstances surrounding the animal’s disappearance and have booked several people in connection with the incident.
The development has drawn attention locally, as pet owners and neighbours seek clarity on what happened to the cat and its expected litter.
The matter came to light when a woman residing in the area filed a complaint with local police, stating that her cat, which was due to give birth shortly, had vanished from outside her home. The animal had been well-known in the neighbourhood, and its unexpected disappearance alarmed residents, who feared for its safety given its condition.
Upon receiving the complaint, police initiated an inquiry and began gathering information from people living nearby.
During the early stages of the investigation, the police examined eyewitness accounts and available surveillance footage to identify individuals who might be linked to the cat’s disappearance. Based on this evidence, authorities identified nine persons allegedly involved in taking the animal.
A first information report was filed, and the accused were booked under relevant sections of the law. Police said the group was detained and taken into custody for questioning as part of the ongoing investigation.
The identities and ages of the nine individuals have not been publicly disclosed, as investigators continue to piece together details of the case.
News of the pregnant cat’s disappearance and the subsequent police action drew reactions from residents, particularly pet owners and animal lovers in the vicinity. Many described the situation as distressing, noting the vulnerability of the animal given its advanced pregnancy.
Several neighbours expressed hope that the cat would be located unharmed and returned to its home. Some criticised the alleged act as needless and cruel, saying that the community had formed a bond with the animal over time.
Animal welfare groups in the city have also taken note of the case, offering to assist with efforts to find the cat and ensure it receives any veterinary care it may need. Police confirmed that they are coordinating with such organisations as part of their efforts.
Authorities have appealed to anyone with additional information related to the incident to come forward and assist with the investigation. Additional statements are being recorded, and police are collecting further evidence to establish the facts and determine the motive behind the alleged act.
Officials said the investigation is ongoing and that appropriate action will be taken based on the findings. As of the time this article is published, the police haven’t found the cat and are continuing questioning related individuals.

TITLE: 'If This Is The Quality Of Banking...': SC Raps Banks Over Handling Of 'Digital Arrest' Fraud Cases
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/if-this-is-the-quality-of-banking-sc-raps-banks-over-handling-of-digital-arrest-fraud-cases-9890124.html
--------------------
The Supreme Court on Monday strongly criticised banks for their handling of “digital arrest" fraud cases, questioning their professionalism and asking why suspicious transactions are not flagged in time, even as customers lose their life savings.
A bench led by Chief Justice of India Suryakant was hearing the matter after the Centre placed status reports filed by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) outlining steps to curb such cyber frauds.
The Attorney General informed the court that data on these cases is being compiled and standard operating procedures are under preparation.
Highlighting the human cost of such crimes, the CJI observed that losses cannot be viewed merely as statistics.
For elderly couples and small depositors, he noted, the amounts siphoned off often represent their entire lifetime savings.
The court underlined that banks have a clear duty of care towards customers and questioned why red flags are not raised when suspicious transactions occur.
“If this is the professionalism and quality of banking they are showing, then it is serious," the CJI remarked, expressing concern over delays by both public and private sector banks in responding to customer complaints.
The bench asked why digital arrest transactions cannot be immediately frozen and alerts sent to customers as well as cybercrime police stations when unusual activity is detected.
The Attorney General told the court that discussions are underway to finalise SOPs specifically for handling digital arrest fraud cases and to fast-track responses.
While MHA and MeitY have submitted status reports, the Reserve Bank of India has also drafted an SOP detailing the steps banks should take upon receiving complaints.
Directing MHA to formally adopt and implement the SOP finalised on January 2, 2026, the court stressed the need to strengthen coordination among agencies to ensure recovery of stolen funds.
It also said High Courts should oversee compliance to prevent multiple, overlapping proceedings.
The amicus curiae assisting the court flagged systemic gaps, pointing out that banks often refuse compensation by claiming victims transferred money “voluntarily", an argument he said ignores the coercive nature of such frauds.
He added that while RBI’s AI-based “Mule Hunter" tool has been rolled out in 86 banks, other mandated safeguards, such as velocity checks to detect rapid fund movements, remain largely unimplemented.
The Supreme Court also questioned why the RBI has not taken tougher policy measures despite reports suggesting that over ₹54,000 crore has been siphoned off abroad.
The CJI asked whether such massive losses stem from negligence, collusion, or a reluctance to inconvenience customers.

--------------------
The Supreme Court on Monday told the West Bengal government that it would not create any impediments to the completion of the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, even as it assured that hurdles in the process would be addressed.
“We will remove hurdles, but we will not create any impediments in the completion of SIR. Let us be very clear about it," Chief Justice of India Surya Kant said during the hearing.
Senior advocate DS Naidu, appearing in the matter, flagged concerns over the appointment of Electoral Registration Officers (EROs), arguing that they perform quasi-judicial functions and must be adequately trained and qualified. He said only 64 officers with adjudicatory experience were appointed, while others were selected based on pay parity, despite SIR decisions being open to challenge in appellate forums.
The bench also discussed the role of micro observers in the process. Senior advocate Shyam Divan argued that large-scale deletion of voter names could not be carried out through micro observers.
The CJI, however, noted that micro observers were part of a system created to assist EROs and AEROs, and that the final decision-making authority rested with the EROs. The court observed that if additional officers joined the process, the quality of decisions could improve.
During the hearing, Divan highlighted the urgency of the matter, pointing out that the SIR process is scheduled to conclude on February 14. He said the draft electoral list contains 7.08 crore voters, of which 6.75 crore are mapped, while around 32 lakh remain unmapped and 1.36 crore fall under the “logical discrepancy" category. The court said it would continue hearing the matter.

TITLE: Karnataka Govt's 'Generous' Distribution Of Cabinet Ranks Puts Strain On State Exchequer
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/karnataka-govts-generous-distribution-of-cabinet-ranks-puts-strain-on-state-exchequer-ws-l-9889710.html
--------------------
The Siddaramaiah-led Congress government has sparked a heated debate regarding fiscal responsibility after significantly expanding the number of individuals holding ministerial status in Karnataka. In a recent move that has drawn sharp criticism from the opposition and fiscal watchdogs, the administration granted the status of Minister of State (MoS) to 54 additional individuals. CNN-News18 has exclusively accessed the documents giving MoS rank to Congress workers. This latest round of appointments brings the total number of people enjoying either Cabinet or MoS rank in the state to a staggering 149, raising serious concerns about the burgeoning burden on the public exchequer.
The vast majority of these new designees are Congress party leaders and workers currently serving as heads of various state-run boards and corporations. While the constitutional limit restricts the actual Cabinet to 34 ministers, the government has bypassed these constraints by according “ministerial status" to a wide array of functionaries. A detailed breakdown reveals that beyond the 32 constitutional ministers, Cabinet rank has been bestowed upon 43 MLAs and 9 non-MLAs, including various advisors and special representatives. Furthermore, 11 MLAs and 54 non-MLAs have been elevated to the rank of Minister of State.
The financial implications of these appointments are substantial, as those with ministerial status are entitled to an extensive suite of perks and allowances. Each appointee receives a monthly salary of Rs 50,000, supplemented by a hospitality allowance of Rs 3,000 and a monthly house rent allowance of Rs 80,000. Maintenance and staff allowances add another Rs 20,000 per month. Additionally, the government provides for 1,000 litres of fuel per month — valued at approximately Rs 1,00,000 at current market rates — alongside daily travel allowances ranging from Rs 2,000 to Rs 2,500.
The perks extend into the administrative realm, with each rank-holder entitled to a personal secretary, multiple personal assistants, drivers, and attenders.
Furthermore, the state covers full medical expense reimbursements and ensures these individuals receive protocol honors equivalent to state ministers at official government functions. Critics argue that at a time when the state is navigating significant financial commitments for its guarantee schemes, the generous distribution of such high-ranking statuses to nearly 150 individuals represents an unnecessary and avoidable drain on taxpayer money.

--------------------
In a significant development for the ambitious Chandrayaan-4 mission, scientists at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) have identified a safe and relatively flat landing area in the Moon’s southern polar region, bringing the country a step closer to its first attempt at bringing lunar samples back to Earth.
The potential landing site has been located near the Mons Mouton mountain and is currently considered the safest option for the mission. According to a report by The Times of India, researchers from ISRO‘s Space Applications Centre carried out a detailed analysis using high-resolution images captured by the camera aboard Chandrayaan-2’s orbiter. Their study identified a stretch of nearly 1 sq km that appears most suitable for a safe landing.
Chandrayaan-4 is being described as ISRO’s most complex lunar mission so far. The mission architecture will include a propulsion module, descender, ascender, transfer module and a re-entry module. As per the plan, the Vikram lander will touch down on the lunar surface, after which samples will be collected with the help of robotic systems similar to the Pragyan rover. These samples will then be carried by the ascender module to lunar orbit and eventually transported back to Earth.
Selecting the landing site remains the most critical and challenging part of the mission. ISRO engineers have laid down strict criteria for the location, including a ground slope of less than 10 degrees, minimal presence of large rocks, continuous sunlight availability for 11-12 days, direct radio communication with Earth and a surface with very few craters.
Earlier studies had identified multiple potential regions near the Moon’s south pole. In the latest phase, scientists closely examined five areas around Mons Mouton. One of these was ruled out because it remains in permanent darkness. The remaining four sites, labelled MM-1, MM-3, MM-4 and MM-5, were studied in detail.
Using digital elevation models created at a fine resolution of 32 centimetres, researchers assessed each area for slope, height variations, sunlight exposure and potential risks. Among them, MM-4 emerged as the safest and most balanced choice. Located at 84.289 degrees south latitude and 32.808 degrees east longitude, the site has an average slope of around 5 degrees, considered ideal for landing operations.
The overall risk level at MM-4 was calculated at just 9.89%, with 568 safe landing grids identified in the area. Scientists also noted that shadows from nearby hills are limited, ensuring sufficient sunlight for powering the lander’s solar panels. By comparison, MM-1 and MM-3 showed risk levels above 12%, while MM-5 had very few safe grids for landing.
Researchers say the study demonstrates how high-resolution imaging can support extremely precise landing decisions for future lunar missions. If the site is approved by the landing selection committee, the region could become the location where India attempts its first lunar sample return.
A successful Chandrayaan-4 mission would place India among a select group of nations that have managed to bring back samples from the Moon or other celestial bodies.

--------------------
A safety and security breach was reported at Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru after an unauthorised air balloon drifted into the highly restricted airfield, triggering an immediate safety scare.
The balloon, which reportedly belonged to a private construction company, BCD, based in Hoskote, was initially launched from the area but veered off course after operators allegedly lost control.
The unexpected entry of the aerial object into the airport perimeter led to heightened activity among security agencies, given the strict aviation protocols governing the airspace.
Under regulations set by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), the operation of any unmanned aerial vehicles, including drones and balloons, is strictly prohibited in the vicinity of airports to prevent potential collisions with aircraft.
Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel intercepted and seized the balloon after it was spotted over the airport premises. A formal complaint has been lodged at the Kempegowda International Airport Police Station against the private entity responsible for the launch.
Devanahalli police have registered a case and are investigating possible technical failures or negligence that led to the incident.

--------------------
The frontispiece of the poem is an interesting depiction of the Mount

This is my third consecutive article for this column that features a book of some kind, and I apologise for the monotony. However, it was too tough to resist writing about this poem. H.D. Love’s Vestiges of Old Madras never ceases to amaze, and educate. Each reading throws up some nugget, as it did last week. This was a poem titled St. Thomas’s Mount. It was written around 1769 or thereabouts for it mentions the attacks on the place by Hyder Ali in 1767 and the cyclone of 1768. The poem was published anonymously in 1774 in England and ascribed to “A Gentleman from India”. The preface, anonymous, is dated Jan 1, 1773, and written at Fort St. George. The author, it says, was not yet 20 when he wrote this poem.
Love establishes that this was Eyles Irwin, born in 1750 and arrived in Madras in 1768. “Fascinated by natural beauty and historic associations of the Mount, he wrote (this) pastoral poem,” says Love. In Madras, Irwin, who was in East India Company service, was appointed Land Surveyor in 1771. Five years later, it was found that he had done nothing and so, the post was abolished. He seems to have done well enough personally, for he applied and obtained from the Company eleven acres of land in the village of “Erembore” for his residence. Irwin was evidently a man of letters for in 1777, back in England, he printed his Series of Adventures in the Course of a Voyage up the Red Sea. He also has other works of poetry and prose to his credit. His death, as per Love, was in England, in 1817.
Outside the compound is barren land with a few palm trees. It reminded me of Jayshree Vencatesan, India’s first Ramsar Award winner. She has always maintained that lush and dense greenery was a colonial creation in Madras, the original vegetation being palm and scrub. A camel and an elephant, with keepers, are wandering around. A tamed cheetah, with its trainer, is hunting what seems to be an antelope on another side.
Now to the poem: it is in three cantos, the first having 220 verses, the second 175, and the third 170. Irwin seems to be one of those that rejoices in warm weather. “Th’ eternal season of our eastern years,” according to him is spring and he wonders if his compatriots back home in England, battered by winter storms and gloom, envy him his good fortune. To us, reading it after 250 years and more makes us wonder, for Meenambakkam, if anything, is always a degree or two hotter than the Nungambakkam meteorological office temperature reading. But it also reinforces the theory that during colonial times, the Mount was considered an ideal getaway from the city.
The area evidently had several mango orchards for the poem pays tribute to the “blessed shade” of the trees and the abundance of the “ambrosial fruit”. The poem then goes on to sing in praise of the elephant and the camel. Then Irwin describes a cheetah, trained to hunt, being encouraged by its keeper to go after antelopes. In his notes, Love has surmised that Collyer’s engraving predated the poem, but what is clear is that it is a faithful depiction of the poem itself. Or was Irwin inspired by the engraving and so fashioned his opening canto after it?
The second canto describes the legend of Saint Thomas right up to his martyrdom and notes how after his passing, all three religions – Gentoo, Mussulman, and Christian, coexist here – “When men unite in a friendly band, and truth presides over a guileless land.” The third canto is somewhat difficult to fathom for it is about various women of the poet’s acquaintance, then in Madras. They are all addressed by their surnames – “fair Lesley, sweet Powney,” a melodious Brooke and the songstress Taswell. Men with these surnames were certainly well-known in Madras history. The poem itself is addressed to an anonymous lady leaving India.
Taken overall, it is not a great work of poetry, but it adds to the collection on the city, or at least the regions that it comprises today.

The proposed draft ‘Defence Acquisition Procedure (DAP)-2026’ seeks to ensure categorisation and procurement strategy based on technological availability and manufacturing readiness and to accelerate the acquisition process, the government said on Tuesday (February 10, 2026).
The draft DAP-2026 document has been uploaded on the website of the Defence Ministry, and it seeks comments or suggestions on it from various stakeholders.
“The Department of Defence has prepared the draft ‘Defence Acquisition Procedure-2026’ to propel jointness, atmanirbharta and integration, force modernisation, and speed of acquisition with scaling of production, leading to the growth and development of the defence ecosystem in the country,” the Ministry said in a statement.
The proposed draft aims to align India’s defence acquisition with the “rapidly evolving geo-strategic landscape”, the growth of the Indian economy, the skilling of human capital, the growth of the private defence industry in the country and the technological imperatives of modern warfare, it said.
Once approved, it will replace the existing Defence Acquisition Procedure-2020.
The DAP is the cornerstone for the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ initiative in defence and focuses on institutionalised preference for “Buy Indian-IDDM (Indian-Indigenously Designed, Developed and Manufactured)” category for procurement, thereby boosting domestic manufacturing and effective reduction of imports, the government said.
“The proposed draft will ensure categorisation and procurement strategy based on technological availability and manufacturing readiness, exclusive procedures for faster acquisition of equipment with a short technological cycle, spiral designing and procurement of major platforms, exploitation of modern technology before bulk procurement, pragmatic indigenous content (IC) and indigenous design (ID) content evaluation, and utilisation of indigenous military material, among others,” it said.
The new DAP proposes to “ease financial and experience criteria” for inclusive participation, delegation of decision-making for quicker acquisition, revamping of trials and quality assurance processes, aggressive infusion of digitisation and automation in acquisition procedures and processes, and ‘Atmanirbharta’ with a focus on indigenous designing and retention of IPR, along with incentives for innovations, it added.
“The DAP would boost defence manufacturing and exports along with restrictions on imports to domestically unavailable and critical equipment only,” it said.
The draft DAP-2026 document, including the Handbook on Guidelines & Annexures, has been uploaded on the website of the Ministry.
The ministry seeks comments or suggestions on the draft DAP-2026 from stakeholders through email in pdf or MS Word format within a period of three weeks, i.e., latest by March 3, as per the prescribed format hosted at the website.
While the Defence Procurement Manual (DPM) 2025 deals with the maintenance and sustenance of “defence equipment/platforms/systems, etc. under the revenue head of expenditure”, the DAP deals with the capital procurement of equipment/platforms/systems, etc. under the capital head of expenditure”, the Ministry said.
The DAP-2026 intends to “weave the security of the nation and technological growth in a single thread and create the canvas for Viksit Bharat-2047,” it said.

A new 2.3-km-long aqueduct on the Chambal river in Rajasthan is set to facilitate the supply of drinking and irrigation water from the revised Parvati-Kalisindh-Chambal link project to as many as 17 districts. The link project has been integrated with the Eastern Rajasthan Canal Project (ERCP) and included in the national perspective plan by the special committee constituted for river linking.
The memorandum of agreement for the project’s implementation was signed between the Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh governments on December 17, 2024. As part of the link project, a provision has been made to supply water to the large and medium irrigation projects and dams located in the project area on the basis of technical and financial feasibility.
Water Resources Minister Suresh Singh Rawat, who inspected the aqueduct construction work at Guhata in Bundi district on Monday (February 9, 2026), described it as a “milestone in water engineering”. The aqueduct, for which the work started in May 2025, has an internal width of 41.25 metres and a height of 7.7 metres.
Mr. Rawat said the construction work, taken up at a cost of ₹2,230 crore in the link project’s first phase, would be completed by June 2028. He walked about 2 km while thoroughly inspecting each point of the aqueduct, designed to transport water from the source to the distribution point with the utilisation of gravity.
The aqueduct will connect Pipalda Samel village in Kota district’s Digod tehsil at one end and Guhata on the other. The water from the Navnera barrage, built on Kalisindh, will be lifted into the Mej river and transported from the Mej barrage through a feeder to the Galwa, Bisalpur and Isarda dams.
The construction of the new aqueduct will also provide an additional route for public transport. Mr. Rawat said the aqueduct would ensure the success of the ambitious project, being implemented at a cost of ₹90,000 crore and stipulating the transfer of excess water from the Chambal river basin to the regions facing water scarcity for the benefit of a 3.25 crore population.
The previous Congress government had demanded the national project status for ERCP, fixing the share of the Centre and the State in the expenditure in the ratio of 90:10. The project is expected to resolve the water scarcity issue in eastern and south-eastern districts in the State at least till 2051.

Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu on Tuesday (February 10, 2026) raised a series of crucial issues concerning Andhra Pradesh during separate meetings with Union Ministers for Jal Shakti, Agriculture, Railways, and Urban Development as part of his official visit to New Delhi, seeking expeditious clearances, enhanced financial assistance, and resolution of long-pending inter-State disputes.
In his meeting with Union Jal Shakti Minister C.R. Patil, the Chief Minister expressed serious concern over Karnataka’s move to increase the height of the Almatti dam, warning that it would adversely affect downstream water availability to Andhra Pradesh. He urged the Centre to safeguard the State’s interests and sought early resolution of inter-State river water disputes.
Requesting the permanent lifting of the stop-work order on the Polavaram project and seeking reimbursement for additional expenditure incurred on canal capacity enhancement, he also sought financial support for Polavaram Phase II, estimated at ₹32,000 crore, and approvals for the Polavaram–Nallamala Sagar link project under the national river interlinking programme.
During a meeting with Union Agriculture Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Mr. Naidu pressed for enhanced Central assistance to promote organic and natural farming. Highlighting Andhra Pradesh’s reduction in chemical fertiliser usage by 2.28 per cent in 2024–25, he sought immediate release of ₹216 crore under the PM-PRANAM scheme.
Nearly 18 lakh farmers had opted for organic farming across 8 lakh hectares. The Chief Minister also sought ₹200 crore for the development of the coconut sector, the release of pending funds under ‘Per Drop More Crop’, and Central support for Totapuri mango farmers and the establishment of a Makhana Development Board in the Kolleru region.
During his meeting with Union Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, Mr. Naidu sought fast-tracking of pending railway projects, operationalisation of the South Coastal Railway Zone from April 1, and alignment of the Bengaluru–Chennai high-speed rail corridor via Tirupati. He also proposed new rail lines, freight corridors, Vande Bharat services, and mega coaching terminals across the State.
In discussions with Union Urban Development Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, the Chief Minister sought ₹105 crore of Central assistance under Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban) 2.0 to implement Andhra Pradesh’s ₹276-crore Zero Landfill action plan.
He said the State was committed to becoming a national model in urban sanitation and sustainable waste management.

An anganwadi in Odisha’s Kendrapara district has not been functioning for nearly three months after residents stopped sending children allegedly due to the appointment of a Dalit woman, Sharmistha Sethy, as a helper-cum-cook.
The 20-year-old graduate claimed that villagers started boycotting the centre at Nuagaon under Ghadiamal gram panchayat in Rajnagar block soon after her appointment on November 20, 2025. “They are also not collecting free food items like sattu (flour made from roasted gram) and eggs for children. My family is very poor. I got this job after much hardship. I want to become a teacher, but no one listened to my repeated appeals,” she said.
Ms. Sethy claimed that the boycott was rooted in caste prejudice. “They are not sending their children because I am a Dalit. Society has advanced in many ways, but if we continue to cling to casteism, we cannot progress,” she said.
An anganwadi worker corroborated Ms. Sethy’s account, saying 20 children are enrolled at the centre but none of them are attending it now. “We went door to door, but no one is willing to send their children,” the worker said.
The Kendrapara district administration on Tuesday deputed a team of officials to assess the situation and explore possible solutions.
“I held talks with the villagers, but they are not citing any specific reason for keeping their children away. They are not openly attributing the issue to the helper’s caste,” Child Development Project Officer Deepali Mishra said.
Ms. Mishra said the post of helper-cum-cook was advertised in 2024 and again in 2025. Eligible villagers were encouraged to apply, she said. “Ms. Sethy was the lone applicant. We are making efforts to ensure that the children return so that their pre-school education is not affected. The final decision will be taken by higher authorities,” she said.
Ms. Sethy, who receives monthly remuneration of ₹5,000, is tasked with cooking meals, assisting in play-based learning activities, and helping with health monitoring.
None of the villagers were willing to comment on the issue.

Nawab Wajid Ali Shah was not exiled to Calcutta but he came to the city because he wanted to take a ship to London to submit a petition but that departure was restricted and he stayed on, according to a biography written by his great-grandson that has just been translated from Urdu to English by the biographer’s daughter, Talat Fatima.
“Lucknow and Calcutta can be called the two very big and very important chapters in Wajid Ali Shah’s life. People usually think that he was sent in exile to Calcutta, that it was like a punishment from the British. The fact is he came to Calcutta on his own volition. He wanted to present a petition before the British Parliament and before the Queen on his dethronement and on the atrocities committed by the British in India. He wanted to reach London via Calcutta, but unfortunately that did not happen,” said Dr. Fatima, a great-great-daughter of the last king of Awadh.
She is the author of soon-to-be-released Wajid Ali Shah: A Cultural and Literary Legacy —published in India by Hachette — which is the translation into English of the biography, authored in the mid-1990s, by her father Kaukub Quder Sajjad Ali Meerza, a scholar who also served as a research consultant to Satyajit Ray for Shatranj Ke Khiladi.
“Most books about Wajid Ali Shah talk about his image, but this book (her father’s) stands out because it is backed by research of about 38 months, that is why it has many hitherto-unknown facts. There are many confusions related to his date of birth, date of death, date of coronation, number of his books and compositions — all this has been meticulously researched,” Dr. Fatima told The Hindu.
“A lot needs to be known about him as a poet and a writer. Lucknow has some of his compositions, but in Calcutta a major part of his compositions that exist are his letters. He used to write love letters to his begums from whom he was separated. He used to write about his mental sufferings in those letters. People usually feel shy of sharing their love letters with the public, but not Wajid Ali Shah. He was an entirely different person. He said that his love letters were masterpieces in literature. Whatever he wrote to his begums are in Kolkata, mostly in Fort William,” she said.
When asked how many begums the last king of Lucknow have, Dr. Fatima said the figure was between 50 and 60, with six to seven staying with him in Calcutta, where he spent the last three decades of his life, dying in 1887 at the age of 65. She said she chose to translate her father’s work because the readership of Urdu was very limited while that of English was worldwide.
“Wajid Ali Shah is more relevant today than ever. We have a lot to learn from him. He was a devout Muslim, but at the same he was secular to the core. Even his compositions included verses on Radha and Krishna, which you will find in the book. He had a healthy attitude towards other religions and languages. He wrote in Urdu, Persian, Arabic, Braj Bhasha. People harp about his relationship with the opposite sex, but that’s mostly because of his own bold pen. This book tells you there is a lot more about him,” Dr. Fatima said.

TITLE: A tug of war over claiming credit
LINK: https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/a-tug-of-war-over-claiming-credit/article70616506.ece
--------------------
For a while, allegations of ‘vote chori’ — the deletion or removal of names from electoral rolls — by the BJP-led Central government and the Election Commission of India dominated the national political discourse. As that rhetoric subsided, a similar narrative began gaining prominence in Andhra Pradesh, with the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) accusing the current government of ‘credit chori’, or of taking credit for projects and policies laid down during Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s tenure.
During the 2024 Assembly elections, the TDP campaigned hard on infrastructure and investment, claiming that Mr. Reddy’s five-year rule had neglected both. Post-election, the new ‘double-engine’ government went on to showcase Andhra Pradesh as a major hub for investment, highlighting the State’s improved infrastructure.
In October 2025, Google announced plans to build a massive one-gigawatt AI data centre campus in Visakhapatnam. The project — Google’s largest AI hub outside the U.S. — will cost nearly $15 billion over five years, ending in 2030. The TDP, led by Information Technology Minister Nara Lokesh, credited the investor-friendly, proactive approach and ease-of-doing-business policies of the Naidu government.
But the YSRCP was not ready to let the narrative slip away. It pointed to the groundwork it laid between 2019 and 2024 — including allotting land to companies such as the Adani Group and providing bureaucratic clearances. It argued that the TDP’s claim was an instance of ‘credit chori.’
For the YSRCP, claiming the Google deal appears to be less about pride and more about damage control. Under constant attack from the NDA for its policies, such as mandating 75% job reservation for locals, which drew widespread criticism nationally, the party is clearly keen to avoid conceding full credit to the NDA.
The YSRCP also came under attack for failing to develop infrastructure in the State. Pothole-ridden roads became a major poll plank for the NDA. When the first test flight landed at the Alluri Sitharama Raju Greenfield International Airport at Bhogapuram on January 4, both sides once again engaged in a credit war.
It 2019, it was during the TDP government’s tenure that the foundation stone for the airport was laid. However, just months later, Mr. Reddy assumed office as Chief Minister. The YSRCP claims this marked a turning point. It asserts that the project gained momentum after the foundation stone was re-laid by Mr. Reddy in 2023. According to the party, land acquisition and key clearances were completed during Mr. Reddy’s five-year tenure, paving the way for completion of the airport.
The TDP, however, maintains that the project was conceptualised and initiated during its tenure and that the remaining processes were carried forward. It points out that TDP MP Kinjarapu Rammohan Naidu holds the Civil Aviation portfolio in the NDA government at the Centre.
Even farmer-focused initiatives are caught in the narrative battle. Mr. Reddy claimed that the comprehensive land resurvey conducted during his tenure enabled the issuance of the new pattadar passbooks to farmers. But the TDP criticised the YSRCP-issued passbooks for showing Mr. Reddy’s photo. Calling it unacceptable, it replaced these with passbooks displaying the State emblem. The TDP asserts that the new passbooks are also error-free — a result of reforms in the revenue system.
What prompted Mr. Reddy to push for the inclusion of his name in the completion of the airport project and the finalisation of the Google data centre deal? It is that the TDP has long accused him of failing to advance projects initiated by the previous TDP government — unlike his father, former Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, and the subsequent Chief Ministers of united Andhra. Mr. Reddy also stalled the Amaravati capital project and slowed the Polavaram Irrigation Project.
The YSRCP aims to shake off the image of having hindered development. It also wants to claim credit for completing two major projects that could transform the State — particularly north coastal Andhra, where the party had performed poorly in the 2024 elections.
While both the YSRCP and TDP are eager to stake their claim to these projects, the timelines provide a clearer indication of who deserves the credit. Ultimately, it will be up to the electorate to decide.

“Tamil Nadu has around 41% share in India’s total electronics exports during the financial year (FY) 2025 at $15 billion. This is likely to have grown to 45% in FY2026,” he said, expressing concern that the Centre has not released State-wise data on electronics exports for the current financial year.
At the 15th edition of Source India-Electronics Supply Chain, organised by the Electronic Industries Association of India (ELCINA), Mr. Rajaa said: “We have done everything possible in India. Now, we want to go compete with the world, which we have been doing in several sectors for a long time. We have expertise in manufacturing and services, and the next big thing to do is R&D (Research and Development)”. He requested the stakeholders present at the event to invest more in R&D.
Sasikumar Gendham, president of ELCINA, said: “Electronics is no longer just an industry — it is the infrastructure for modern civilisation. From mobility and healthcare to defence, energy, AI and space, it sits at the core of every national priority. As global supply chains are being re-imagined, with reliability and resilience becoming as important as cost, India stands at a historic inflection point. The question is not whether India can play a global role, but how fast and how decisively we scale.”
He then pointed out we must move decisively beyond low-value assembly into design-led manufacturing, advanced components and materials, tooling and IP ownership. Mr. Gendham said electronics leadership demanded strong component ecosystems, MSME integration, academia-industry collaboration, and deep supplier development. “With established clusters in Chennai, Sriperumbudur, Hosur, Coimbatore, and Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu has built a full-stack electronics ecosystem — from design and components to final assembly and exports,” he added.
Atul Lall, vice-chairman and managing director, Dixon Technologies India Ltd. and past ELCINA president, said: “India’s electronics manufacturing sector is entering a phase of accelerated growth, driven by scale, policy support and increasing global confidence. The next phase of competitiveness will depend on deeper localisation, strong component ecosystems and continued investment in technology and skills.”
A report on the Tamil Nadu Electronics Industry, released at the event, said the State accounted for 28.6% of India’s electronics manufacturing gross sales value, ranking second only to Uttar Pradesh. “However, Tamil Nadu is aggressively investing in the future as it leads in actual asset addition within the electronics industry, with a commanding 47.6%. The State’s overall exports in 2023-24 was estimated at $43.5 billion, with 22% attributed to electronics exports,” the report stated. It added: “Tamil Nadu also has 191 units related to electronics manufacturing. With the state having the most units producing mobile handsets and related components, Tamil Nadu’s exports are $14.65 billion. These factors show how the sector has seen a rise of 414% from 2021-22, when electronics exports were a mere $1.86 billion.”
The report also gave some recommendations on creating a dedicated electronics manufacturing promotion agency, establishing a semiconductor technology park, and investing in an advanced testing and certification centre.

TITLE: Kerala launches ‘Rakshakavacham’ accident insurance scheme for private sector workers

Minister for Labour V Sivankutty launching ‘Rakshakavacham’ on Tuesday.
Minister for Labour V Sivankutty on Tuesday launched ‘Rakshakavacham,’ a new accident insurance scheme aimed at providing financial security to private sector workers in the state.
Describing it as a “major labour welfare initiative,” Mr Sivankutty said the scheme would offer crucial protection to workers and their families during times of crisis.
Inaugurating the scheme here, he said ‘Rakshakavacham’ would provide protection and assurance to lakhs of private sector workers, describing the labour force as the backbone of Kerala’s development.
‘Rakshakavacham’ means “shield of protection.”
The Minister said the government had earlier implemented the Wage Security Scheme to ensure timely payment of wages, and at present, over 3.65 lakh establishments and more than 13 lakh workers are covered under the system.
“Beyond wage security, the government felt the need to support the family of a worker during times of crisis. It was from this concern that the ‘Rakshakavacham’ insurance scheme was conceived,” the Minister said.
The scheme is a group personal accident insurance programme implemented through the Comprehensive Health Insurance Agency of Kerala (CHIAK) for workers employed in establishments registered under the Wage Security Scheme. CHIAK is the nodal agency for implementing public health insurance schemes in the State.
In the event of accidental death, whether at the workplace or otherwise, the family of the deceased worker will receive ₹5 lakh as immediate financial assistance. The amount will be provided in addition to benefits available under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, Mr Sivankutty said.
He added that with an annual contribution of ₹150, the government aims to extend the safety cover to around 25 lakh workers.
Considering the importance of the scheme, ₹30 lakh gas been allocated for it in the 2025–26 State Budget.
The Minister noted that accidents involving private sector workers often push families into debt and poverty and said the assistance under the scheme would offer significant relief and help them recover.
Registration for the scheme will be carried out through CHIAK with the support of the Labour Department. In the event of death, applications can be submitted to the nodal agency’s district officer along with the death certificate, FIR and legal heir certificate.
Officials have been instructed to verify eligibility and ensure speedy disbursement of assistance, he said, appealing to employers to enrol their workers under the scheme.

TITLE: Family forced to carry body of relative home on two-wheeler in Andhra Pradesh as government hospital has no ambulance

--------------------
The family of a deceased man in Andhra Pradesh was forced to transport his body to their home on a two-wheeler for about 10 km as the hospital did not have an ambulance for the purpose and private vehicles demanded up to ₹2,000 to carry the body. The incident, which lays bare glaring gaps in basic public health infrastructure, occurred in Karlapalem mandal of Bapatla district on Tuesday.
Nakka Nageswara Rao of Rallacheruvu hamlet in Chintayapalem panchayat reportedly suffered severe chest pain and his family members rushed him on a two-wheeler to the Bapatla Area Hospital. When they reached the hospital, doctors declared him brought dead.
The grieving family then approached private auto drivers to take the body back to their house in the village. However, the auto drivers demanded up to ₹2,000 to carry the body, which the impoverished family could not afford. Left with no other option, they carried the body on the same two-wheeler to their home for about 10 km.
The incident, which occurred close to the district headquarters, has sparked public outrage.
Reacting to the incident, the YSRCP accused the State government of failure to ensure availability of even basic ambulance service to people. “When the family sought a vehicle to take the body home, they were asked to pay thousands. With empty pockets and no official help, the grieving relatives carried the body for nearly 10 kilometres on a bike. This humiliation happened near a district headquarters. Not in a forest. Not in an inaccessible region,” the party highlighted in a post on X.
Following media reports, District Collector Dr. V. Vinod Kumar ordered a comprehensive inquiry into the incident. Speaking to The Hindu, he said that there was no ‘Mahaprasthanam’ (hearse service) vehicle currently available at the Bapatla Area Hospital. He said that such vehicles are allotted to hospitals based on the number of deaths recorded and that the Bapatla hospital had not qualified so far due to relatively low mortality figures.
However, the Collector made it clear that families of patients who die while undergoing treatment in government hospitals are not required to bear transportation costs. He assured that the government would provide necessary assistance to indigent families from available funds.
The Collector issued a circular instructing that in unavoidable situations, hospital authorities must ensure ambulance arrangements or provide financial assistance before releasing bodies. He also announced plans to convene a district-level meeting with police, Regional Transport Officers, health officials and private ambulance operators to regulate ambulance charges.
The incident has renewed demands for strengthening humane healthcare services at peripheral hospitals.

The Supreme Court on Tuesday (February 10, 2026) asked the Election Commission of India (ECI) to consider suggestions made in a writ petition to frame a standard operating procedure to trim election expenditure.
A Bench headed by Chief Justice of India Surya Kant said the suggestions made by petitioner Prabhakar Deshpande were “worth consideration”.
Mr. Deshpande, an IIT graduate and chemical engineer, had sought directions for the poll panel to formulate a plan of action against erring candidates and to re-examine the cap on election expenses to ensure democratic credibility.
While the ECI defended its existing oversight mechanisms, including the deployment of independent expenditure observers from the All India Services, the Bench noted that the petitioner’s grievances regarding the effectiveness of these measures were filed in the larger public interest.
“We have no reason to doubt the plea has been filed in the larger public interest. The plea seeks the Election Commission to formulate a detailed policy to curb excessive election expenditure. The plea cited a report detailing such expenditure. The ECI has filed a counter inter alia questioning the authenticity of the report,” the Bench observed.

--------------------
Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) council on Tuesday approved a revised expenditure budget of ₹1,643.64 crore for the year 2026-27, after the YSRCP corporators raised objections to allocation of ₹450 crore for the stormwater drain project.
The tenure of the VMC elected body will end in March, after which the Special Officer would take on the responsibility of the corporation. In the last budget meeting, presented by Mayor R. Bhagyalakshmi, the initial proposed budget was ₹2,093.65 crore, with the total expenditure being ₹2,093.65 crore and the total income being ₹1,968.13 crore respectively.
However, YSRCP corporators unanimously opposed allocations of ₹450 crore for the stormwater drain project, after which the budget estimates, both capital income and expenditure, were revised.
Of the ₹600-crore proposed for the project, VMC’s proposed share is ₹150 crore, while Capital Region Development Authority’s (CRDA) share is ₹150 crore and concessionaire’s share is ₹300 crore. The YSRCP corporators rejected the Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) proposal, citing increased burden on the public.
“Earlier too, Larsen and Toubro was given the contract for completing the project, but they discontinued in between, leaving much work unfinished. Now, once again they talk about handing it over to a private player. Ultimately, the burden will fall on the public,” said YSRCP floor leader Venkata Satyanarayana.
Among other proposed expenditures, ₹60 lakh has been allocated for shelter homes for homeless people, ₹50 lakh for modernisation of food street, ₹5 crore for development of hill areas in the city, ₹50 lakh for canal beautification, ₹3 crore for road widening projects, ₹50 lakh for footpaths, ₹5 crore for animal birth control operations and establishment of dog centres and ₹4 crore for eradication of mosquitoes.
TDP floor leader N. Balaswamy, meanwhile, suggested that the allocations for addressing mosquito and stray dog issues be increased to ₹10 crore. The two issues have become subjects of discussion regularly in council meetings.
No allocation has been made for the Budameru Development Plan this year, while in 2025-26, ₹7.50 crore was allocated for the same. The corporation is not expected to receive funds for the same.
On the income front, the corporation is expected to receive funds to the tune of ₹100 crore under Urban Reforms Funds, ₹178 crore under the 15th Finance Commission Grants, ₹10 crore under the SASCI (Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment) scheme. It is not expected to receive any funds for pollution control.
The overall budget points to a trend of increasing borrowings and burden, said CPI(M) corporator B. Satya Babu. He questioned the State government’s lack of funding for the city. There is ₹1,200 crore pending from both State and Centre on various heads of work, he alleged.

The Congress party is likely to step up its pressure against the Narendra Modi Government over the Indo-U.S. trade deal, with the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi likely to focus on it when he takes part in the discussion on the Union Budget on Wednesday (February 11, 2026).
The Lok Sabha, which has been paralysed since February 2, started functioning on Tuesday (February 10, 2026), after the Opposition submitted a notice to move a resolution against Speaker Om Birla for conducting the proceedings in a “partisan” manner.
Before moving the petition, senior Opposition leaders, including Akhilesh Yadav of the Samajwadi Party (SP), K.C. Venugopal and Gaurav Gogoi of the Congress, Abhishek Banerjee of the Trinamool Congress, and T.R. Baalu of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) met Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju to end the stalemate, but were unsuccessful.
The Opposition agreed to allow normal functioning since it wants to raise crucial issues, including the trade deal, during the Budget discussion.
Earlier in the day, Mr. Gandhi pointed to a poster Opposition MPs were carrying near the Makar Dwar of Parliament during their protest, which read ‘Narender Surrender’.
“This has happened”, in the Indo-U.S. trade deal, he said.
In a statement posted on his X handle, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge claimed the trade agreement sacrificed India’s strategic national interests and exposed the betrayal of the Modi government.
“Fine print of the Indo-U.S. trade deal has exposed how PM Modi mortgaged India’s national interests,” Mr. Kharge alleged, terming it “trapped surrender”.
The truth of the “trap deal” was now slowly coming out, he said, listing four key objections to the pact.
Referring to the issue of Russian oil, he said the White House fact sheet now listed “India’s commitment to stop purchasing Russian Federation oil” as a condition for the removal of an additional 25% tariff, even though the joint statement had not mentioned it.
Why had the government agreed to such “erosion of sovereignty”, Mr. Kharge asked, adding that the Congress had already flagged the U.S. executive order on monitoring India’s oil imports.
Mr. Kharge alleged that the government had “back-stabbed” farmers by opening agriculture to foreign goods. Pulses were added to the February 9 fact sheet although absent in the February 6 joint statement, he said. References to animal feed utility for red sorghum had disappeared, he said, while imports of dried distillers’ grains (DDGs) and sorghum could hurt dairy farmers and cattle.
“Two crore dairy farmers will suffer the consequences, but the RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh)-Sangh Parivar-BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party), who carry out lynchings in the name of the cow, are hell-bent on destroying our country’s cattle population,” Mr. Kharge alleged.
The deal would hurt the apparel sector, especially because of American concessions to Bangladesh, the Congress said.

The Election Commission of India on Tuesday (February 10, 2026) extended the deadline for Special Intensive Revision (SIR) hearings in West Bengal to February 14, 2026. The date for publication of the final voter lists has been moved to February 28. This came after the Chief Electoral Officer of West Bengal sent a formal request to the ECI for an extension on February 7, citing pending work.
The Supreme Court on Monday (February 9) asked the ECI to extend the SIR deadlines by at least one-week.
“Since the process of scrutinising documents submitted by affected people in response to notices served on them is likely to take longer than anticipated, and as suggested on behalf of some of the petitioners, we direct that at least one week beyond 14.02.2026 be granted to the EROs/AEROs to complete the scrutiny of the documents and take an appropriate decision,” the Supreme Court order said on Monday (February 9, 2026).
The Supreme Court order by a division bench, comprising Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and N. V. Anjaria, and requests from the CEO and the WB office led to the ECI extending the deadline.
“Further, in compliance with the Supreme Court’s direction, the Commission has revised the SIR schedule in the State of West Bengal,” an official notification from the ECI addressed to the CEO, WB stated on Tuesday (February 10, 2026).
The revised dates are February 14 for completing of SIR hearings, February 21 for scrutiny of documents and disposal, with final electoral rolls to be published on February 28. Previously, the SIR hearings were to be completed by February 7, and the final electoral list was to be published by February 14.
The West Bengal SIR exercise is in its final phase, with only about 3-5% hearings remaining, according to the West Bengal CEO. However, around 25% of document uploading and digitisation remains pending, which led officials to seek more time from the CEO, Manoj Kumar Agarwal.
Over 94.49 lakh people were summoned for hearings under the logical discrepancies category, and over 31.68 lakh voters who were classified as “unmapped” were also asked to appear for hearings.
Those who fail to appear for their hearings within the extended timeline may be struck from the final 2026 voter lists.

The Kannada Development Authority (KDA) has appealed the State government to continue the ‘Nali-Kali’, a multi class teaching programme with necessary modifications, stating that it  helps unleash the creativity hidden in children.
The KDA, which submitted a report to Minister School Education and Literacy Madhu Bangarappa on Tuesday on the implementation of the  programme, alleged that it  failed due to poor implementation .
“Even after 30 years of implementation of the Nali-Kali programme, teachers have not been able to properly adopt this.  As a result, teachers have  expressed their opposition to the Nali-Kali and parents are also not fond of this. The Nali-Kali can be successful only if teachers take responsibility for identifying the learning style of the child. Teachers should provide them with appropriate tools and techniques to enhance the learning experience of children. Unfortunately, no such efforts have been made anywhere,” reads the report.
“The teachers have failed to creatively utilise one period of  80 minutes of the Nali-Kali project. When the trained teachers retired, the guest teachers appointed in their place did not get the expected results as they did not receive proper training. The age, learning level and learning ability of children from class one to three are not the same. In such a situation, the teachers have failed in terms of group formation and management to make multi-class teaching meaningful. This has severely hampered language learning,” it stated.
“In classes with a large number of students, the teachers are not able to pay equal attention to all the children. The learning materials (stickers, picture lists, charts, etc.) required to conduct classes meaningfully have not been adequately supplied to many schools.  Children who studied under the Nali-Kali up to Class 3  are finding it difficult to adapt to a different system in the class 4,” it stated.
Speaking to The Hindu, KDA chairman Purushothama Bilimale said, “There were allegations that due to the Nali-Kali project and the Kannada medium, parents are hesitant to admit their children to government schools and have turned to private schools. In this context, it was decided to conduct a study on the programme. Information was obtained from parents, teachers, children, and other stakeholders across the state,  and a report was submitted to the School Education Minister”.
However, the State government has decided to phase out the Nali-Kali programme in primary education and convert the multi class teaching into single grade teaching.

--------------------
The Unreserved Ticketing System (UTS), the official mobile application of Indian Railways designed for booking unreserved train tickets, will be discontinued with effect from March 1. This change is part of a feature upgrade undertaken by the Centre for Railway Information Systems (CRIS).
​A press release issued on Tuesday (February 10) said that several key features had already been deactivated to ensure a managed transition. Passengers will find that season ticket bookings, new user registrations, and platform ticket purchases are no longer functional on the legacy app.
​Besides, the R-Wallet top-up facility has been disabled. While the UTS app may still appear on various app stores, railway officials have cautioned that downloading or updating the software will not restore these services.
​As the UTS platform reaches the end of its life, the Southern Railway has started directing all passengers to the new RailOne app. Developed by CRIS, RailOne is now the primary gateway for all unreserved ticketing and passenger services.
​The new platform boasts several improvements over its predecessor, including a modernised user interface for faster navigation and enhanced security protocols for digital payments. Besides, it also has integrated passenger services designed for a more seamless travel experience.
​The Palakkad Division of the Southern Railway has urged the public to download the RailOne app immediately to avoid any last-minute disruption to their journeys. Planning ahead and moving to the RailOne platform now will ensure that ticketing arrangements remain unaffected when the UTS app is fully decommissioned next month.
​Passengers who currently hold active tickets or balances in their R-Wallet are encouraged to check the RailOne app for migration options or contact the station helpdesk for further assistance.

--------------------
The State government has spent ₹5,000 crore to protect and strengthen the public education sector, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Tuesday (February 10). He was declaring the Munderi Government Higher Secondary School as the State’s first integrated international school.
The Chief Minister said the objective of development was to ensure that everyone benefited from it equally. He noted that universal and free education, strengthened by social reformers and later by policy interventions, had ensured near-total school enrollment in the state.
The government, he said, had taken major steps since 2016 through the Public Education Protection Mission to upgrade infrastructure, ensure the timely distribution of textbooks from June 1, and improve academic standards.
According to him, improvements in general education had also led to children of migrant workers enrolling in public schools, reflecting the growing confidence in the system. Significant changes were also underway in the higher education sector.
Highlighting the transformation of the Munderi school from a conventional high school into a national model, Mr. Vijayan said infrastructure of international standards had been created alongside curriculum and timetable reforms. Arts and sports were given equal emphasis.
Established in the 1980s with strong public support, the school had grown steadily over five decades.
A cluster model integrating the higher secondary school with 14 primary schools in the panchayat was implemented under the ‘Mudra’ scheme, which aided rapid development.
The campus now features modern laboratories, an advanced robotics lab, smart classrooms, and bio-gardens to help students learn from nature.
The school, the Chief Minister said, had become a source of pride for Kerala’s public education sector.
Former MP K.K. Ragesh and District Collector Arun K. Vijayan were present.

--------------------
The Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) has accused the Congress government and Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy of keeping silent on drawal of Krishna water by Andhra Pradesh in excess of the share as per the ad hoc arrangement in force till finalisation of shares by the Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal (KWDT-II).
Deputy Floor Leader of the BRS in Assembly and former minister T. Harish Rao stated here on Tuesday (February 10) that the issue of excess use of water by A.P. over the agreed share was proved with the letter of Engineer-in-Chief of Telangana addressed to the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) on January 28.
Quoting the contents of the letter, Mr. Harish Rao against the agreed water share of 66:34 (AP:Telangana) only 2.45 tmc ft water was due for drawal by A.P. as on January 27, both from Srisailam and Nagarjunasagar reservoirs. Addressing a press conference he stated that AP had drawn 664 tmc ft of Krishna water so far this water year (2025-26), 16 tmc ft in excess, and it amounted to over 80% share against its entitlement of 66%.
The BRS leader explained that a letter written to the ENC of A.P. by the Member-Secretary of KRMB, in response to Telangana’s letter to the board, on February 6 it was stated that as on January 29 A.P. had utilised 79.21% and Telangana just 20.79% against their agreed temporary shares of 66 and 34, respectively. The letter had put the water drawal of A.P. at 555.5 tmc ft as on January 31 against 156.04 tmc ft.
According to the river board, the drawal shares work out to 78.07% and 21.93% by AP and Telangana, respectively, as on January 31. Such a huge excess drawal of water by A.P. was making the prospects of standing crops under lift irrigation systems including Kalwakurthy based on Srisailam reservoir water and Left Canal under Nagarjunasagar project uncertain.
Mr. Harish Rao alleged that Mr. Revanth Reddy was paying ‘guru dakshina’ to his A.P. counterpart and political mentor N. Chandrababu Naidu by allowing the neighbouring State to draw Krishna water indiscriminately. He further alleged that the Telangana government had kept the ENC post, which would pursue the matter of river water use, vacant for about a week after the retirement of Mohd. Amjad Hussain on January 29.
He accused the Centre led by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) too of doing injustice to Telangana by favouring A.P. in the matter of river water use, despite two Union Ministers from Telangana. He demanded that the State government stop water drawal by A.P. immediately and carry forward the unused water this year to next water year or else the BRS would not keep silent and stage a protest at KRMB office, if necessary.

TITLE: Soldier due for disability pension, if chronic disability was due to military service: Kerala HC
LINK: https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/soldier-due-for-disability-pension-if-chronic-disability-was-due-to-military-service-kerala-hc/article70616321.ece
--------------------
The Kerala High Court has held that a soldier is entitled to disability pension even if he sought voluntary discharge from service, provided the chronic disability was acquired or aggravated due to military service.
B. Manikuttan, a native of Mavelikara who served as a Havildar in the Army, approached the High Court after the Armed Forces Tribunal dismissed his plea challenging the denial of disability pension on the ground that he had sought voluntary discharge.
Mr. Manikuttan contended that he was in sound physical condition at the time of his enrolment in 1986. However, after being posted in Jammu and Kashmir in 1994, he was diagnosed with bronchial asthma. As his condition worsened, it was recommended that he be released from service, following which he sought voluntary discharge.
A Division Bench comprising Justice K. Natarajan and Justice Johnson John held that the petitioner was eligible for disability pension, noting that bronchial asthma is a chronic, lifelong condition. The court also took into account the Medical Board’s finding that the disability had been aggravated by military service.
The court directed the authorities to pay the arrears of disability pension within three months and noted that the Release Medical Board had assessed the petitioner’s disability at 20%.

--------------------
Senior BJP leader and Union Minister for Coal and Mines G. Kishan Reddy said that the upcoming municipal elections in Telangana will be a direct contest between the BJP and the ruling Congress, asserting that BRS is “nowhere in the picture”.
Speaking at a press conference in New Delhi on Tuesday, he accused Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy of making “false and misleading” statements about the BJP and Central funding, claiming the remarks were driven by the growing popularity of the BJP among voters.
Mr. Kishan Reddy said the BRS had “lost public confidence” and “collapsed”, remarking that voting for the party was equivalent to “throwing your vote into the Musi river”. At the same time, he alleged that both the BRS and the Congress were attempting to influence voters by distributing large amounts of money.
The Union Minister challenged the Chief Minister to present a detailed account of his government’s achievements and its progress in fulfilling election promises. “This is the fourth election since he came to power but nothing substantial has been delivered,” he alleged.
Mr. Kishan Reddy sought a judicial probe into the BJP’s Makthal municipal ward candidate Erukala Mahadevappa. He advised the Chief Minister not to “use the BJP as a tool to target others” and said the party would support action if the government proceeds with the arrest of former Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao in connection with alleged phone-tapping and other irregularities during the previous regime.
He further claimed that both the Congress and the BRS had “mortgaged the honour of Telangana people to Darussalam”, asserting that irregularities during the two parties’ tenures would be investigated if the BJP comes to power.
Accusing Mr. Revanth Reddy of “low-level politics” and “tall claims without action”, he reiterated his offer for a public debate — either at the Secretariat or the Press Club — on Central funding to Telangana over the past 12 years. The Secunderabad MP maintained that the Centre had “never, at any point”, stated it would declare the Palamuru–Rangareddy project a national project.

TITLE: Over 50% Of Global Exploitation, Racism Complaints By Indian Students Come From Russia: Govt
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/over-50-of-global-exploitation-racism-complaints-by-indian-students-come-from-russia-govt-ws-l-9893802.html
--------------------
A new data from the Ministry of External Affairs shows that over half of all complaints of exploitation and racial discrimination by Indian students globally come from Russia, The Times of India reported.
According to the data, Indian students across 196 countries lodged around 350 complaints of harassment, exploitation and racial discrimination in 2025. Of these, more than 200 originated in Russia, with Moscow emerging as the biggest hotspot.
The number of complaints from Russia has risen sharply over the past three years, from 68 in 2023 to 78 in 2024, surging to 201 in 2025.
Most Indian students in Russia are pursuing medical courses, and hail from states including Rajasthan, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Russia remains a popular destination due to lower tuition fees and relatively easier admission procedures.
The issue came into focus following a stabbing incident at the State Medical University in Ufa, in Russia’s Bashkortostan Republic, on Saturday. A 15-year-old school student armed with a knife attacked students in a dormitory, injuring four Indian medical students and two police officers.
The Indian Embassy in Moscow said the four students were “stable and recovering well," and consular officials from Kazan visited them in hospital. The teenager pleaded guilty and has been remanded to two months’ judicial custody.
Meanwhile, during a Rajya Sabha question hour in December last year, Minister of State for External Affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh had stressed that the government gives high priority to the welfare and safety of Indian students abroad.
He had noted that Indian missions regularly contact students, visit educational institutions, and provide support through the MADAD portal, emergency helplines, emails, and social media, to ensure grievances are addressed promptly.
“Complaints related to misleading academic programmes or untoward incidents/experiences faced by Indian students abroad are promptly taken up with the concerned educational institutions and/or with the authorities of the host country for necessary action," Vardhan had noted.

LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/no-mandatory-service-charge-centre-as-restaurants-across-india-slapped-with-hefty-fines-9893774.html
--------------------
The Centre on Tuesday said that levying a mandatory service charge on food bills violates consumer protection laws, warning that restaurants engaging in the practice are liable to face penalties.
The Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution said the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) has taken action against 27 restaurants across the country for what it described as “unfair trade practices".
The action was initiated suo motu under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, which prohibits the compulsory collection of service charges.
According to the CCPA, automatically adding a service charge to a customer’s bill is unlawful.
The authority cited violations under Section 2(47) of the Act, which defines unfair trade practices. As part of the enforcement drive, Café Blue Bottle in Patna was fined Rs 30,000, while Mumbai-based restaurant China Gate was penalised Rs 50,000 for levying a default 10 per cent service charge on customers.
The ministry noted that the Delhi High Court, in March 2025, upheld the CCPA’s guidelines, affirming that mandatory collection of service charges by hotels and restaurants is contrary to law.
Under these guidelines, hotels and restaurants are barred from automatically or compulsorily adding a service charge to food bills, or collecting it under any alternative name.
Establishments must clearly inform customers that payment of a service charge is voluntary and optional, and cannot deny entry or services to those who refuse to pay it. The guidelines also specify that service charges cannot be subjected to GST.
Acting on complaints received through the National Consumer Helpline, the CCPA has directed erring restaurants to refund the full amount charged to consumers, immediately discontinue the practice, and remove the default inclusion of service or similar charges from their billing systems.
The ministry said enforcement action will continue to ensure compliance and protect consumer rights.

LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/social-media-firms-asked-to-remove-harmful-content-within-3-hours-as-govt-notifies-new-it-act-rules-9893032.html
--------------------
The government has notified a new law and revised guidelines aimed at tackling deepfakes and misleading AI-generated content on the internet, requiring platforms and users to clearly disclose material that is not real and significantly tightening timelines for takedown of harmful content.
Under the new framework, anyone uploading AI-generated or AI-altered photos, videos or audio, including deepfakes, will be required to declare that the content has been created or modified using artificial intelligence. Social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and X will also be mandated to clearly label AI-generated content so users are not misled into believing it depicts a real person or a real event.
The law further mandates that AI-generated files carry embedded digital tracking, or metadata, enabling experts to identify the AI tool used to create the content. Platforms have been barred from allowing the removal or suppression of such labels or associated metadata once applied, a move aimed at strengthening traceability and accountability in cases of misuse.
Taking cognisance of the spread of AI-based deepfakes, the IT Ministry has set a strict three-hour deadline for social media intermediaries to take down AI-generated or deepfake content once it is flagged by the government or ordered by a court. Earlier, platforms had up to 36 hours to remove such content. Grievance redressal timelines have also been tightened, with platforms now required to acknowledge user complaints within two hours, down from 24, and resolve them within seven days instead of 15.
The revised guidelines also direct social media companies to deploy reasonable and appropriate technical measures, including automated tools, to detect and prevent the circulation of illegal, sexually exploitative or deceptive AI-generated content. Platforms must ensure that users are not allowed to create, publish or disseminate synthetically generated information that violates existing laws, including the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the POCSO Act and the Explosive Substances Act.
Additionally, intermediaries have been instructed to periodically inform users — at least once every three months — about the consequences of violating rules related to AI misuse through their terms of service, privacy policies or other appropriate means. Where violations are detected, platforms are required to take “expeditious and appropriate action".
The changes are intended to curb the misuse of artificial intelligence, improve transparency online and ensure faster action against harmful digital content, even as social media platforms have already begun rolling out features that allow users to label content generated or modified using AI.

--------------------
Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Tuesday said the Ministry of Home Affairs has put in place a comprehensive and multi-dimensional strategy to tackle cybercrime, with a strong focus on real-time reporting of cyber incidents.
Speaking at a national conference on ‘Tackling Cyber-Enabled Frauds and Dismantling the Ecosystem’, organised by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Shah said cybercrime has evolved beyond financial fraud and now poses serious challenges to the country’s digital security.
The Home Minister said the government’s strategy rests on several key pillars, including real-time reporting of cybercrime, the creation of a robust network of forensic laboratories, capacity building of enforcement agencies, research and development, promotion of cyber awareness, and ensuring cyber hygiene across cyberspace.
“Our goal is to bring together all stakeholders to create a secure and trustworthy digital ecosystem," Shah said, adding that agencies such as the CBI, National Investigation Agency (NIA), Reserve Bank of India (RBI), state police forces and other investigating bodies are being integrated into a coordinated framework to combat cyber threats effectively.
He noted that the rapid growth of digital transactions and UPI-based payments has made cybersecurity a critical national priority.
While acknowledging that cyber fraud cases have increased alongside India’s expanding digital footprint, Shah said sustained and coordinated measures are being taken to counter emerging threats.
Highlighting institutional coordination, the Home Minister referred to platforms such as I-Force, established to facilitate real-time cooperation among enforcement agencies. He said the initiative has delivered results and will now be further strengthened with deeper inter-agency collaboration.
Providing an update on enforcement efforts, Shah said agencies led by the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) have so far saved or frozen over Rs 8,000 crore of the nearly Rs 20,000 crore lost to cyber fraud until November 30, 2025.
During this period, around 82 lakh cybercrime complaints were received, resulting in the registration of 1.84 lakh FIRs.
However, Shah cautioned that cybercriminal networks are becoming increasingly organised and technologically advanced, often staying ahead of law enforcement.
He urged participants at the conference to intensify efforts and take the fight against cybercrime to the next level.
The Home Minister also said that while 62 banks and financial institutions have already been onboarded onto the secure framework, the government aims to bring all cooperative banks under its ambit by December 31 to further strengthen safeguards within the financial system.

--------------------
Bird flu, also known as avian influenza, has triggered fresh concern in parts of Andhra Pradesh, prompting the state government to step up surveillance and containment measures. While officials stress that the situation remains under control, precautionary steps have been intensified not only in the affected pockets but also in neighbouring villages and districts to prevent further spread.
Deaths of country chickens were reported from parts of Chittoor and Annamayya districts, prompting the Animal Husbandry Department to send samples to the Bhopal-based National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases for testing.
State minister Kinjarapu Atchannaidu has urged people not to panic, stating that the outbreak is being handled through coordinated action by animal husbandry and local administrative teams. He stressed that early detection and rapid response are helping authorities keep the risk contained.
Cases Surface In Annamayya District
The immediate alert was issued after suspected bird flu cases emerged in Sadum mandal of Annamayya district. Unusual bird deaths were reported in villages such as Puttavaripalli and Ammagaripalli, prompting swift intervention by officials. Once the infection was suspected, special Rapid Action Teams were deployed to the area.
These teams are carrying out scientific culling of infected birds, disinfecting poultry farms and surrounding zones, and restricting the movement of birds and farm equipment. Such containment protocols are standard practice to stop avian influenza from spreading to healthy flocks.
Surveillance Extended To Chittoor
Authorities have also widened monitoring to nearby regions after reports of unexplained bird deaths surfaced in parts of Chittoor district, including Karvetinagaram mandal. Samples from affected birds have been collected and sent to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases laboratory in Bhopal for confirmatory testing. Officials said further action will depend on laboratory findings.
Guidelines For Poultry Farmers
The Animal Husbandry Department has issued continuous advisories to poultry farmers in and around affected zones. Farm owners have been asked to strictly follow biosecurity norms, limit entry of outsiders into poultry sheds, and immediately report any sudden or unusual bird deaths to veterinary officials. Field teams led by senior department officers are visiting villages to spread awareness and ensure compliance with safety protocols.
No Need To Fear Cooked Chicken Or Eggs
Amid rising public concern, the government has clarified that bird flu primarily affects birds and does not pose a risk through properly cooked food. Citizens have been reassured that thoroughly cooked chicken and boiled eggs remain safe for consumption. However, people are advised to maintain basic hygiene, such as washing hands after handling raw meat and avoiding contact with sick or dead birds.
Officials remain confident that with early intervention, strict monitoring, and public cooperation, the outbreak can be contained before it spreads to other districts. The focus, they say, is on prevention without triggering unnecessary alarm.

TITLE: 'How Did He Get Book?' BJP Asks Rahul Gandhi Amid Naravane's Memoir Row, Congress Responds
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/how-did-he-get-the-book-bjp-asks-rahul-gandhi-as-mm-naravanes-memoir-publisher-denies-release-9892696.html
--------------------
The BJP on Tuesday stepped up its attack on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, questioning how he obtained a physical copy of former Army chief General MM Naravane’s memoir after its publisher said the book has not yet been released.
The controversy centres on Four Stars of Destiny, General Naravane’s memoir, after Penguin Random House India issued a clarification stating that while it holds exclusive publishing rights, the manuscript has not been published “in any form" so far.
The publisher said the statement was issued in view of reports about unauthorised copies being circulated.
Despite the clarification, Gandhi maintained that the book was publicly available, citing a social media post by General Naravane from December 2023.
A screenshot of the post shows the former Army chief announcing that his book was “available now" and directing readers to a link.
Addressing reporters outside Parliament, Gandhi said the publisher’s claim was questionable. “Here is a tweet from General Naravane which says, ‘Just follow the link to my book.’ Either General Naravane is lying or Penguin is lying, and I do not believe the former Army Chief would lie," he said.
Here is a tweet from Mr Naravane which says, “Just follow the link to my book." The point I am making is this: either Mr Naravane is lying, or Penguin is lying. I do not think the former Army Chief would lie. Penguin says the book has not been published, but the book is available… pic.twitter.com/Xtn7gygC2K— Congress (@INCIndia) February 10, 2026
The BJP rejected Gandhi’s argument, saying he had misunderstood the difference between a pre-order announcement and an official publication.
BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonwalla accused the Congress leader of misleading Parliament and the public, calling him a “national embarrassment".

The tweet he quoted was a Pre-order
Now the question remains
— Shehzad Jai Hind (Modi Ka Parivar) (@Shehzad_Ind) February 10, 2026
General Naravane’s December 2023 post had included an image from Penguin highlighting that Four Stars of Destiny was available for pre-order, a distinction the BJP has emphasised in its response.
Hello friends. My book is available now. Just follow the link. Happy reading. Jai Hind pic.twitter.com/VCiLiZOWIi— Manoj Naravane (@ManojNaravane) December 15, 2023
However, General Naravane on Tuesday himself shared Penguin Random House India’s clarification on the status of his memoir, Four Stars of Destiny, as the controversy over the book’s publication continued to trigger sharp political exchanges.
Congress MP Karti Chidambaram also reacted to the controversy, saying that anything available in the public domain should be considered as published.
The row over the memoir erupted last week during a heated debate in Parliament when Gandhi sought to read excerpts from a book review published by an Indian news website, relating to the 2020 India-China standoff in eastern Ladakh that culminated in the Galwan Valley clash.
Gandhi was stopped by the Speaker, who cited House rules barring unpublished material from being read into the official record.
Although Gandhi offered a personal assurance on the authenticity of the excerpts, he was prevented from reading them out again the following day, triggering sharp exchanges between ruling party and opposition MPs.
The disruption led to the suspension of eight opposition MPs for the remainder of the session.
Amid continued protests, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s scheduled Lok Sabha address was cancelled, a move the Speaker attributed to opposition members allegedly planning an “attack" on the Prime Minister.
Subsequently, Gandhi wrote to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, describing the episode as a “blot on our democracy" and protesting against what he termed an attempt to silence debate on national security issues.

--------------------
Amid the ongoing controversy over General (Retd.) MM Naravane’s memoir Four Stars of Destiny, Penguin India on Tuesday issued another clarification, stating that an announced title, a pre-order listing and a published book are distinct stages, and that a book is considered published only when it is available for purchase across retail channels.
In its latest clarification, the publisher said the presence of a pre-order listing does not amount to publication. “A book is considered published only when it is available for purchase across retail channels," Penguin Random House India said, reiterating that Four Stars of Destiny has not been published in any format.
The renewed clarification comes after Congress MP Rahul Gandhi questioned the publisher’s stand, alleging inconsistencies over the book’s status. Citing a 2023 post by Naravane that said, “Hello friends. My book is available now. Just follow the link. Happy reading. Jai Hind," Rahul Gandhi claimed the tweet suggested the book had been made available. He said either Naravane or Penguin was “lying" about the release.

The publisher has maintained that the tweet carried only a pre-order link and that the book was withdrawn two days later. Since then, Four Stars of Destiny has remained unavailable on e-commerce platforms, Penguin said.
After Penguin’s second clarification, BJP leader Shehzad Poonawalla, too, attacked Congress MP Rahul Gandhi, calling him a “national embarrassment" and accusing him of not understanding the difference between a pre-order listing and a published book.
He also alleged that Gandhi had misled the country, levelled “completely false" allegations against Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, and disrupted Parliament on the basis of what he claimed was an incorrect premise.
Earlier, Penguin India had issued a formal statement on X asserting that it holds the sole publishing rights for the book and that it has not been released. “We wish to make it clear that the book has not gone into publication. No copies of the book, in print or digital form, have been published, distributed, sold, or otherwise made available to the public by Penguin Random House India," the publisher said.
Congress MP Rahul Gandhi triggered a political row after displaying a copy of former Army chief General (Retd.) MM Naravane’s memoir Four Stars of Destiny in the Lok Sabha, drawing strong objections from senior BJP leaders who said the Leader of the Opposition cannot quote in Parliament from an unpublished book.

--------------------
Over a month after a migrant worker from Odisha was assaulted in Tamil Nadu, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has issued a show cause notice to Tamil Nadu Chief Secretary and has directed to ensure all necessary medical treatment, post-trauma counselling, and reimbursement of any treatment costs for the victim.
NHRC further noted the delayed FIR registration and the sudden disappearance of the victim from the hospital without follow-up searches. In regards to this, the commission asked the Tamil Nadu Director General of Police to submit an explanation within seven days and to trace the victim at the earliest.
The Tamil Nadu government has been informed about the migrant worker Suraj, who was brutally attacked with sharp weapons, left the hospital in an injured condition and has since gone missing, with no current information available about him.
The incident reportedly took place on December 27 last year, and the victim’s statement was recorded on the same day. However, the FIR was registered the next day after pressure was built up on social media.
NDRC has accused the state authorities of not making effective efforts to trace the injured victim or identify his family members.
The Commission has termed this a serious lapse of the state machinery and a violation of the victim’s right to life and dignity under Article 21 of the Constitution.
The Chief Secretary has been directed to submit a detailed explanation and action-taken report on the negligence and lapses on the part of the police and administration.

--------------------
India is yet to take a final decision on joining the Board of Peace for Gaza proposed by US President Donald Trump and is unlikely to attend its inaugural summit scheduled for February 19.
Officials said New Delhi is still studying the proposal and assessing its broader diplomatic implications, according to The Economic Times.
The issue came up during the recent India–Arab League Foreign Ministers’ meeting, where Arab League members, who have agreed to be part of the board, shared their views with India. However, officials indicated that India is continuing its internal deliberations. The proposal is also expected to be discussed during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s upcoming visit to Israel, where regional security concerns and Gaza’s future are on the agenda.
India has consistently supported a two-state solution to the Israel–Palestine conflict and is evaluating how participation in the board could affect its long-standing engagement with Palestine. A key concern for New Delhi is the presence of Pakistan and Turkey on the board. Pakistan had earlier been encouraged by the Trump administration to consider deploying stabilisation forces in Gaza, adding another layer of complexity to India’s assessment.
The inaugural summit, to be held at the US Institute of Peace in Washington, will bring together leaders who accepted Trump’s invitation earlier this year, along with members of an executive committee tasked with overseeing Gaza’s governance, security and reconstruction.
Who Will Attend Gaza Peace Board Meeting?
The Express Tribune reported, citing sources, that Pakistan has confirmed it will attend the inaugural summit, with officials saying the forum would allow Islamabad to present its position directly to major international stakeholders and push for coordinated efforts to prevent civilian casualties and regional instability.
More than 20 countries have joined the Gaza Peace Board so far. Participants include Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Argentina and Hungary. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accepted an invitation to serve on the board and is expected to be in Washington for separate talks with President Trump. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has also confirmed his attendance.
Eight Muslim-majority countries — Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Qatar and the UAE — are expected to take part, with efforts to present a common position on Gaza. India’s participation remains under active consideration.

Naravane’s tweet carried a pre-order link, but two days later the publisher withdrew the book, and since then it has remained unavailable on e-commerce platforms.
The statement comes amid a growing controversy over the alleged circulation of unauthorised copies of the manuscript, which has also led to a political row in Parliament.
The Delhi Police have registered an FIR and started a probe into what they describe as suspected illegal distribution of material from a publication that has not yet been approved.
Penguin India issued a formal clarification on X, stating that it holds the sole publishing rights for Four Stars of Destiny and that the book has not been published in any format.
The publisher said it was responding to recent public discussion and media reports about the alleged circulation of a pre-print version of the manuscript.
“We wish to make it clear that the book has not gone into publication. No copies of the book, in print or digital form, have been published, distributed, sold, or otherwise made available to the public by Penguin Random House India," the statement said.

TITLE: AI Summit: Hotel Room Rates In Delhi Cross Rs 1 Lakh Per Night Next Week, Demand For Govt Price Ceiling
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/ai-summit-hotel-room-rates-in-delhi-cross-rs-1-lakh-per-night-next-week-demand-for-govt-price-ceiling-ws-el-9891167.html
--------------------
Hotel prices have skyrocketed in New Delhi for the weekend, as the national capital prepares to host the India AI Summit.
This has triggered fresh warnings of a growing crisis of excessive pricing during major international events. A comprehensive survey has brought the issue to the fore, revealing that some properties are charging as much as Rs 20 lakh per night for a suite.
The survey, conducted by LocalCircles, highlights a pattern of exploitative pricing that typically accompanies major sports tournaments and global summits. According to the data, there is a stark disparity between standard rates and those offered during high-demand periods.
In central Delhi, five-star hotels witnessed prices cross Rs 60,000 per night. Even more modest four-star accommodations, which typically cost around Rs 6,000, are being marketed for over Rs 30,000 — a five-fold increase. In some instances, rates have reportedly surged by up to 10 times their standard fees as hotels capitalise on the influx of visitors.
This trend mirrors previous spikes seen during the 2023 Cricket World Cup, where prices rose three to five times the regular rate and, in Navi Mumbai, where some hotels charged Rs 5 lakh for a three-night stay during a Coldplay concert.
The survey report revealed that 57 percent of the consumers have experienced excessive charging by hotels at least once in the last three years. Of those who have faced these steep rates, 7 percent reported paying inflated prices almost every time they booked a room.
The hospitality sector’s current “free market" approach has left many feeling vulnerable. “Any time there is an international event, hotel room rates skyrocket in India with no upper limit," the report stated, pointing out that the ministry of tourism has no regulations to protect consumers from such spikes.
The survey reported that this has led to an overwhelming demand for government intervention, with 71 percent of the respondents in favour of a price ceiling. The most popular proposal, supported by 49 percent of those surveyed, is that the maximum rate charged should be restricted to no more than twice the regular rack rate to ensure fair treatment.
To ensure these limits are respected, 74 percent of citizens are calling for the appointment of a regulatory body or government agency to oversee compliance, with a separate regulator under the tourism ministry; using the Competition Commission to monitor compliance; and empowering the Central Consumer Protection Authority to handle grievances.
The report concludes that while the hospitality sector is vital for job creation and tourism, the Centre must play a “more proactive role" to ensure the industry remains profitable without subjecting tourists and business visitors to exploitative practices.

--------------------
A theft on the high-security premises of Vidhana Soudha has triggered alarm over possible lapses in access control and monitoring at Karnataka’s seat of power.
According to the complaint filed with the local police, the incident took place in the office of Congress minister Byrathi Suresh, from where a handbag containing about 300 grams of gold jewellery and Rs 1.5 lakh in cash went missing.
Police said the bag belonged to Naveen, who had visited the minister’s office for official work.
He reportedly carried the handbag with him during the visit but inadvertently left it behind on the office premises.
Naveen realised the bag was missing only when he returned the following day and subsequently lodged a complaint at the Vidhana Soudha police station.
During the preliminary investigation, officials scrutinised CCTV footage installed inside the complex.
The footage, police said, indicated the involvement of a D-group employee attached to the Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms (DPAR).
Visuals reportedly showed the employee picking up the handbag from within the office area and leaving with it.
Based on the evidence, the suspect was identified and taken into custody.
Police confirmed that the accused was arrested, and further investigation was underway to establish the sequence of events and whether anyone else was involved in the theft.
Authorities have not yet commented on whether additional security audits will be ordered following the incident.
Police said further details would emerge as the probe progresses and once questioning of the arrested employee is completed.

--------------------
Parliament Budget Session Live: The Lok Sabha resumed proceedings at 2 pm on Tuesday after being adjourned twice earlier in the day. As the Budget session continues amid a deadlock, the Opposition submitted a no-confidence notice against Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla.
Gaurav Gogoi, Deputy Leader of Congress in Lok Sabha, said the notice, signed by 118 Opposition MPs, was submitted under Article 94-C of the Constitution to the Lok Sabha Secretary-General. Notably, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) chose not to sign the notice. Meanwhile, BJP women MPs have written to Speaker Birla, urging him to take “strictest possible action” under parliamentary rules against certain Opposition MPs following disruptions in the House on February 4.
Separately, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs is scheduled to meet later, with the Foreign Secretary and Commerce Secretary briefing members on the India-US trade deal. The Shashi Tharoor-led committee is expected to debate the deal’s impact on India-Russia relations amid ongoing oil sanctions. Discussions will also cover the EU trade agreement and India-Bangladesh relations. Follow for live updates.
Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, did not sign the notice of no-confidence motion against Speaker Om Birla, as it is not proper for the LoP to sign a petition for the removal of the Speaker in a parliamentary democracy, ANI reported, citing sources on Tuesday.
Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Tuesday directed the House Secretary-General to examine the no-confidence motion notice against him and take appropriate action, ANI reported, citing sources. The Congress today submitted a notice of no-confidence motion against the Speaker.
Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Tuesday addressed the Lok Sabha, presenting his views on the Union Budget.
Lok Sabha proceedings resumed on Tuesday following the submission of a no-confidence notice against Speaker Om Birla. The notice, signed by 118 Opposition MPs, triggered heated debates in the House, though the Trinamool Congress (TMC) chose not to support it. Lawmakers returned to the floor to continue discussions on ongoing legislative business amid heightened political tensions.
The Opposition has formally submitted a no‑confidence notice against Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla to the Secretary‑General, with a total of 118 MPs signing the motion. However, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) chose not to add its support.
Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju on Tuesday met senior Opposition MPs on Tuesday in an effort to break the parliamentary logjam, sources said. Congress leaders KC Venugopal and Gaurav Gogoi, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, Trinamool Congress MP Abhishek Banerjee and BRS leader TR Baalu were present at the meeting. During the discussions, the Opposition insisted on key demands, including that Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi be allowed to speak in the House, suspended MPs be reinstated, and remarks made against women MPs be withdrawn, sources added.
Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju on Tuesday accused the Congress of taking pride in what he termed the most degrading conduct by its MPs inside Parliament. In a post on X, Rijiju said the behaviour had diminished the dignity of the House and provoked strong reactions from BJP members during the session.
The Lok Sabha has been adjourned again till 2 pm amid Opposition protest.
Lok Sabha proceedings have resumed after being adjourned earlier in the day.
The Opposition in the Lok Sabha is set to submit a no‑confidence notice against Speaker Om Birla to the Secretary‑General after 1 pm on Tuesday as part of a coordinated effort to challenge his handling of House proceedings amid repeated adjournments and disputes over speaking rights for Opposition leaders. The move aims to formally initiate a motion under parliamentary rules seeking the Speaker’s removal from office, reflecting deepening tensions in the Budget session between Opposition parties and the ruling side.
Addressing reporters outside Parliament, Rahul Gandhi reacted to Penguin India’s statement on ex-Army Chief Manoj Naravane’s “unpublished” book, highlighting a contradiction. He pointed to a tweet by Naravane promoting the book’s availability online, saying, “Either Mr Naravane is lying, but I believe… I don’t think he or Penguin is lying, but both can’t be telling the truth. Penguin says the book is not published, but it is available on Amazon.”
Rajya Sabha proceedings are underway.
The Lok Sabha remained in deadlock on Tuesday as proceedings were disrupted by sloganeering from opposition members just four minutes after the session commenced. Unable to resume normal business, the Speaker adjourned the House until 12 noon.
Lok Sabha proceedings have begun on Tuesday.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in the Parliament for the ongoing Budget Session.
The Foreign Secretary and Commerce Secretary are set to brief a parliamentary panel on the India-US trade deal, with intense debate expected in the Tharoor-led committee. Opposition members are likely to seek clarifications on the deal’s impact on India-Russia relations, particularly in light of ongoing oil sanctions. Ahead of the session, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar held a detailed briefing yesterday with NDA MPs who are part of the committee. The meeting will also cover discussions on the EU trade deal and India-Bangladesh relations.
BJP women MPs have written to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, demanding the “strictest possible action, under the rules,” against Opposition MPs who, they allege, disrupted proceedings by tearing papers, entering the treasury benches, and surrounding the Prime Minister. The letter describes these actions as “heinous.”

The impact of nationwide general strike on Thursday called by various trade union organisations is likely to be minimal in Karnataka. While the banking services are likely to be affected in the State, public transport operations are expected to continue without major disruption. Schools are also set to function as usual, though the supply of midday meals may be impacted.
The strike, called by central trade unions and supported by organisations representing agricultural, rural, and informal sector workers, is expected to witness participation across sectors in several States.
Bank employees associated with the All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA) and Bank Employees Federation of India (BEFI) in Karnataka are expected to stay away from work. However, in Karnataka, major transport utilities have indicated that commuter services are unlikely to be disrupted.
The KSRTC Staff and Workers’ Federation in Karnataka said it would extend moral support to the strike. “We are supporting the nationwide general strike in solidarity with workers’ demands. However, we do not anticipate large-scale disruption of bus services in the State,” a senior member of the federation said.
A senior official of the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) clarified that operations would continue as scheduled. “There will be no impact of the strike on KSRTC services. Buses will operate as usual across all divisions,” the official said.
Similarly, a senior official of the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) confirmed that city bus services in Bengaluru would run normally on Thursday.
At the Kempegowda International Airport, official sources from Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL) said no advisory had been issued so far. “We have not received any advisory regarding the strike. If there is any likely impact on flight movements or airport operations, we will issue passenger advisories. As of now, there is no issue anticipated,” an official said.
The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL)official  also stated that Namma Metro services would operate as per the regular schedule.

Less than half of the students trained under the PM-DAKSH scheme between 2021 and 2024 were placed, as per data released in the Lok Sabha on February 3. Under the Scheme, training institutes are required to provide employment (which includes wage and/or self-employment) to at least 70% of the trained candidates after completion of training under Short Term Training Courses. If these institutes fail to do so, the release of 30% of the training cost per candidate is forfeited. About 1.5 lakh candidates were trained between 2021 and 2024, of which 44% were provided job opportunities.
The Pradhan Mantri Dakshata Aur Kushalata Sampanna Hitgrahi (PM-DAKSH) Yojana, is a Central Sector Scheme that was launched during 2020-21. The programme was intended to provide skills through good quality institutions so that candidates from its target group can find employment. The target group includes members of Scheduled Castes, Other Backward Castes, Economically Weaker Sections, and the De-notified Tribes in India (DNTs), including those who are ‘Safai Karamcharis’ or waste pickers.
There are three Corporations under this Department, the National Scheduled Castes Finance and Development Corporation (NSFDC), National Backward Classes Finance & Development Corporation (NBCFDC), and National Safai Karamcharis Finance & Development Corporation (NSKFDC). These corporations extend loan facilities and assistance to the eligible youth in setting up their projects, training, and financial assistance for employability and entrepreneurship after pursuing education.
Data show that all three corporations fell short of their required placement rate. Only 49.8% of the trained candidates were placed under the NSFDC, meant to assist members of the Scheduled Castes. States such as Rajasthan, Tripura, and Jharkhand saw less than 40% of the candidates placed.
Similarly, the NBCFDC for Backward classes managed to place 48.9% of the trained candidates between 2021 and 2024.
Only 23% of the candidates who trained under the NSKFDC, meant for DNTs including Safai Karamcharis, were placed. As per the data released in the Lok Sabha, 16 out of 25 States trained no candidates under NSKFDC in 2023-24.
From 2024–25 onwards, PM-DAKSH has been merged with the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) of the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship.

Union Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan attended Janpratinidhi Sammelan (People’s Representative Conference) held in Agartala on Wednesday (February 11, 2026) to mark the launch of the ‘Viksit Bharat – Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin)’ or VB–G RAM G. The event saw inauguration of various rural development projects and beneficiary felicitation programmes.
Union Minister for Rural Development and Agriculture Chouhan was the chief guest of the event at the Vivekananda Mini Stadium. Attendees included Tripura Chief Minister Dr. Manik Saha along with several of his Cabinet colleagues holding portfolios for finance, higher education, industries, tourism, social welfare and fisheries.
Speaking on the occasion, Union Minister Chouhan recalled Swami Vivekananda’s vision of India becoming a world leader, stating that this aspiration is being fulfilled under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership. He stressed the designation of the North-East as ‘Ashtalakshmi’ and described Tripura as a ‘Dhanalakshmi’ hub, indicating the State’s importance in rural development.
Mr. Chouhan also criticised Opposition parties, specifically the Congress and Left Front, for their past administrations which he claimed only changed project names without substantial contributions contrasting this with the current initiative aimed at guiding rural development effectively.
Chief Minister Dr. Manik Saha highlighted the central government’s commitment to strengthening the rural economy and emphasised the need for judicious use of funds to achieve genuine development.
During the event, several projects  were inaugurated.  Certificates were distributed to beneficiaries of various projects.
Some departments, including the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, established exhibition stalls, facilitating interaction between visitors and officials present.

The nationwide outrage triggered by the three-month boycott of an Anganwadi centre following the appointment of a Dalit woman appears to have had little impact on the villagers, who skipped a meeting convened by the Kendrapara district administration in Odisha to resolve the crisis amicably on Wednesday (February 11, 2026).
A team of district level officials led by Kendrapara Sub-Collector had visited Nuagaon village under Ghadiamal gram panchayat in Rajnagar block where villagers had stopped sending their kids to Anganwadi centre after Sharmista Sethy, a 20-year-old graduate from the Dalit community, was given appointment as helper-cum-cook.
“We want villagers to send their children to Anganwadi centre as the absence is affecting their pre-school learning as well as healthy diets, as the government provides free of cost. However, only Sarpanch and ward member (elected representatives) and two villagers turned up for meeting,” said Deepali Mishra, Child Development Project Officer (CDPO).
According to sources, villagers are not attributing any reason for their boycott as they think it could attract legal complication. However, casteism was said to be root cause for the boycott, said a senior officer involved in mobilising villagers for amicable solution.
Ms. Misrha said, “we have asked Sarpanch and ward members to hold discussions with villagers and persuade them not to boycott Anganwadi. It was emphasised that normalcy should return to Anganwadi at the earliest.”
Ms. Sethy who was the lone candidate for helper-cum-cook in Anganwadi centre was appointed on November 20, 2025. To her utter surprise, parents stopped sending to Centre subsequent to her appointment. The 20-year-old woman pleaded before villagers to send their kids, but nobody paid heed. It needs to be mentioned that the woman hails from the same Nuagaon village.
The district administration had made it clear that under no circumstances the appointment would be withdrawn.

--------------------
In settings where rapid, affordable diagnostics are unavailable, antibiotics often substitute for testing instead of complementing it.

Charles Darwin’s central insight wasn’t just that species evolve but that they can’t but adapt in the presence of selection pressures. In practical terms, organisms don’t choose to change: they respond to the environments in which they’re trying to live. This insight should trouble us when we consider antimicrobial resistance (AMR): because resistance isn’t an anomaly of the antibiotic era — it is a logical consequence.
For many decades, we have governed antibiotics as static medical tools: prescribed to individuals, regulated largely by access and volume, and evaluated using short-term clinical outcomes. So when resistance emerged, we treated it as a breakdown of stewardship, compliance, and/or enforcement. Yet in the biological sense, resistance is not a failure of use. It’s the expected outcome of using antibiotics at scale.
Antibiotics aren’t only pharmacological agents: they are evolutionary interventions that reshape microbial populations wherever they’re deployed. Every antibiotic dose is a selective event. It means each time you take an antibiotic, you create a strong evolutionary pressure in your body and its surroundings. Bacteria that are susceptible are killed or suppressed while those that can resist survive and multiply. Repeating the antibiotic doses amplifies this selection, increasing the share of resistant strains.
Every clinic, hospital, farm, and wastewater outlet becomes a place where microbial populations are shaped by survival advantage. The problem is not that evolution is surprising but that our health systems continue to behave as though it can be ignored.
Bacteria also adapt on timescales that governance does not. Mutations arise within hours. Resistant strains circulate within days. Surveillance updates, treatment guidelines, and regulatory responses unfold over years. This structural lag ensures resistance becomes visible only after it has become widespread.
In India, this lag is most evident in everyday care, including crowded outpatient clinics, district hospitals with limited laboratory support, and private practices under pressure to act quickly. In settings where rapid, affordable diagnostics are unavailable, antibiotics often substitute for testing instead of complementing it.
But from a systems perspective, the dynamics of how resistance arises and becomes visible means stewardship guidelines alone can’t counter it if they are not anchored in diagnostic capacity and real-time feedback. In fact, AMR is a failure of system design more than that of compliance. It’s particularly difficult to govern because it doesn’t belong to any single sector. Human health, animal husbandry, pharmaceutical manufacturing, sanitation, and environmental regulation all shape the microbial landscape, often without coordination.
Antibiotic residues entering water bodies create environmental reservoirs of resistance genes. Sub-therapeutic dosing in livestock selects for traits that later spill into human infections. Incomplete dose regimes in humans can increase the selection of AMR. Fragmented surveillance and uneven infection control further accelerate spread. No single actor drives this process, which also means no single intervention can reverse it.
India’s National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance correctly recognises this complexity through a ‘One Health’ framework. However, the Plan needs to be more strongly embedded in routine healthcare delivery, especially outside tertiary institutions.
Antibiotics also reshape microbial populations inside patients’ bodies and in communities. Yet clinicians are rarely trained to think in terms of selection pressure, population dynamics, and the long-term efficacy of antibiotics yet are expected to manage patient outcomes. Likewise, while there’s renewed optimism around  discoveries driven by artificial intelligence and novel antimicrobial platforms, they won’t fall in place if the way we use antibiotics doesn’t change.
Preserving the efficacy of antibiotics  therefore depends on how diagnostics, surveillance, procurement, stewardship, and environmental controls are aligned. Market incentives that reward volume will undermine this goal. There is an opportunity for India here, not only as a manufacturer of medicines but as a country that builds public systems to treat antibiotics as a shared resource rather than just as a consumable.
Charles Darwin’s insight that adapting to one’s environs is not optional endures because it’s a question of survival. The question AMR poses is whether our health systems and policies can adapt with the same persistence as the organisms they seek to ‘treat’, or if they will continue to treat evolution as an administrative inconvenience and risk obsolescence.

Opposition parties in Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday (February 11, 2026) hit out at the State Government, describing the budget as a farewell budget with no focus on common people, adding the departure of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is certain in the upcoming 2027 assembly poll. Congress president Ajay Rai demanded a white paper on the projects and proposals that were sanctioned and implemented in the previous budgets.
“This is the last and farewell budget of the BJP government. The BJP has forgotten the promises made to the people. It is misleading the public only with figures and propaganda. There is nothing in the budget for the poor, for the farmers, for the youth. If the size of the budget is big, why hasn’t inflation come down? Why didn’t unemployment end?” asked the Samajwadi Party (SP) president, Akhilesh Yadav, in Lucknow.
Mr. Yadav alleged that the government has not been able to spend even 50% of the previous budget so far. “The per capita income of U.P. is second from bottom to second as compared to other states of the country. The government should tell what the capital income is of the poor who are being given rations,” he said.
U.P. Congress president Ajay Rai demanded a white paper on the projects and proposals that were sanctioned and implemented in the previous budgets. “We demand a white paper on the projects and proposals sanctioned and implemented in the previous budgets. The whole budget is a bogus exercise under the BJP government; most departments fail to spend the sanctioned amount of the last budget allocated to their departments. In 60 districts, medical colleges have been established but they lack basic infrastructure. We all know the districts numbering 37 in Purvanchal and Bundelkhand are backward in all indicators, but the government hasn’t given any special package to these regions,” Mr. Rai told The Hindu.

Three cases have been filed in Madhya Pradesh’s Chhatarpur against a group of people after a protest they were carrying out against the Ken-Betwa river linking project and the arrest of a local activist turned violent, officers said on Wednesday (February 11, 2026).
According to the police, locals from various villages under the Bijawar tehsil were on Tuesday evening (February 10, 2026) protesting for various demands, including the release of Amit Bhatnagar, who is also a leader of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and better compensation and rehabilitation for those affected by the ambitious project. The demonstration, however, turned violent late in the night, leading to stone pelting by protestors and blockading of the tehsil premises, which resulted in sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Vijay Dwivedi and various officials getting stuck inside.
The protestors included tribals, women and workers of Opposition parties such as the Congress, AAP and the Samajwadi Party.
Chhatarpur Superintendent of Police Agam Jain told The Hindu that while the protests were going on peacefully in the evening, a group of drunk men tried to create a nuisance in the night, which led to a tense situation for some time.
“We have identified about 10 people who tried to create a nuisance and are working to detain them. Some people also misbehaved with a baraat (wedding procession) that was passing by and assaulted the people in it. One of the FIRs has been filed based on a complaint from them,” he said, adding that one FIR has been lodged for manhandling government officials while another for blockading.
The FIRs have been filed against more than 40 unidentified people.
While local reports claim that the police resorted to lathi charges, Mr. Jain denied the allegation and said that only mild force such as water cannons was used to disperse the crowd.
Mr. Jain said that senior officials also held meetings with the representatives of the protestors on Wednesday (February 11, 2026) and addressed their concerns.
“The situation is peaceful now. There is no heavy deployment in the area but the police are keeping a vigil to maintain peace,” he added.
A district administration official, who requested anonymity, said that Mr. Bhatnagar was arrested on the “apprehension that he may disturb the peace in the area” under Section 170 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS).
Flagged off by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 25, 2024, the Ken-Betwa link project (KBLP) is the first of 30 such link projects under a National Perspective Plan (NPP) for water resources development and interlinking of rivers with ‘surplus water’ to those with ‘deficit water’. The KBLP plans to transfer excess water from the Ken river basin to the Betwa river basin in the Bundelkhand region that covers parts of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.
However, residents of several villages in Chhatarpur and Panna districts have long been protesting the project over fears of displacement and demanding better rehabilitation and improved compensation. Various environmentalists, including Former Union Environment Minister and Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh, have also expressed concerns over its potential impact on the environment, local ecology and wildlife, as a large part of the project falls inside the Panna National Park and Tiger Reserve.

The Haryana government’s Voice Feedback Portal has received over 11,000 suggestions from citizens across the State for the budget slated to be presented later this month.
Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini had launched the Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based initiative on January 6 to invite suggestions from citizens with the objective of making the State budget for 2026-27 a “People’s Budget”. It marks the first ever use of AI in such a manner within India’s administrative and democratic framework, according to the State government.
“Suggestions concerning local self-governance or municipalities and panchayats topped the list at 750, followed by 450 on infrastructure development, and 200 on education, skill development, and employment,” Raj Nehru, Director General of the Swarna Jayanti Haryana Institute for Fiscal Management, told The Hindu.
He said 20% of respondents were women and other suggestions were related to fiscal resilience, innovation, public finance, ease of doing business, energy, cost rationalisation, digital security, future-ready governance, labour, women, child safety, start-ups, industrial growth, and economic drivers.
As part of the consultation process, the Chief Minister also conducted 12 pre-budget meetings in January, including with sarpanches and councillors for the first time. The process concluded on January 27 after a meeting with MLAs and MPs. Suggestions were also invited through the National Informatics Centre’s portal.
“More than 15,000 suggestions were received from all these mediums for sectors such as agriculture, education, health, finance, infrastructure, panchayati raj, urban development, health, and women and child development,” said Mr. Nehru, who also serves as Officer Special Duty to the Chief Minister.
All suggestions were collected and analysed by the Swarna Jayanti Haryana Institute for Fiscal Management. Over 2,000 shortlisted suggestions were sent to the heads of various government departments and their final proposals will be presented to the Chief Minister for inclusion in the budget, he said.
Mr. Nehru added that some “very relevant and important suggestions” were received pertaining to women and child development: CCTV cameras and dedicated helplines for women at workplaces, crèches in industries, mandatory Prevention of Sexual Harassment Act audits at all workplaces, and increasing the participation of women in the manufacturing sector. He said 300 such suggestions were shortlisted and the Chief Minister has issued directions to examine them for inclusion in the budget.
The budget will be guided by the State government’s ‘Vision-2047’ document unveiled by Union Home Minister Amit Shah in Panchkula on December 24 last year.
“To align the targets of the State budget with the ‘Vision-2047’ document, the Chief Minister held a day-long brainstorming session in Gurugram on January 6 that was attended by secretaries of various government departments, representatives from the industry, and experts,” Mr. Nehru said.

The State Cabinet on Wednesday permitted Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) to seek a loan of ₹1,016.24 crore from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) for the second phase of the Kochi metro.
Minister for Industries P. Rajeeve said in a communication that the second phase of the Kochi metro would be completed in a time-bound manner. A memorandum of understanding was signed involving the Centre, State government, and KMRL in 2023 for implementing the second phase of the project from Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium to Infopark via Kakkanad.
The process of seeking loan to the tune of ₹1016.24 crore was initiated after the signing of the agreement. The authorities held talks with five international funding agencies including AIIB, which agreed to provide the assistance. The loan has to be repaid in 25 years, including a five-year repayment moratorium, it said.
The State Cabinet had accorded administrative sanction for the revised estimate of ₹1,957.05 crore for the 11.2-km Kochi metro extension from Jawaharlal Nehru stadium to Kakkanad in March 2023. The Union government had approved the second phase of the metro in September 2022.
According to the funding plan, the Centre and State governments will provide ₹274.90 crore each as equity for the project. It will have a 16.23% contribution through this fund infusion. The Centre and the State will provide ₹63.85 crore each (3.77%) as subordinate debt of Central taxes for the Phase-II work.
Loan from bilateral/multilateral agencies forms ₹1,016.24 crore (60%). The total cost excluding land, resettlement, and rehabilitation and public-private partnership component will come to ₹1,693.74 crore.
Work on the second phase of the metro is expected to be completed by December 2026, according to KMRL.

The founder and chancellor of Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT) G. Viswanathan said that more than 11,000  students were given scholarships worth over ₹13 crore under its various flagship schemes like Support the Advancement of Rural Students (STARS) and Higher Education for All for more than 15 years.
In his presidential address at the STARS event, which was organised by VIT’s Universal Higher Education Trust (UHET) for the first time in Tiruvannamalai, he said that despite the Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) of Tamil Nadu being 47%, which is above the national average of 28%, the enrollment ratio in northern districts of the State remained low.
As a result, economic growth of the region suffered. “The VIT has established Higher Education for All Foundation to bridge the gap in enrollment ratio between northern districts and the rest of the State. Schemes like STARS program have been implemented to uplift rural students in erstwhile North Arcot districts, which are economically and educationally backwards,” he said.
On the occasion, Deputy Speaker of Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly and chief guest K. Pitchandi distributed scholarships worth ₹28 lakh to 242 meritorious students.

Three new high-level bridges across Cheyyar, a tributary of Then Pennai, near Kalasapakkam and Chengam towns in Tiruvannamalai were opened on Wednesday, fulfilling the long-standing demand of residents in at least 45 surrounding villages.
Officials of State Highways, which built the new facility, said that three new bridges were constructed between Kalur - Kuruvimalai villages; Poondi - Pazhakovil villages near Kalasapakkam town; and Thekavadi - Kezha Kollai Kottai villages near Chengam town in the district. “We have to walk on the dry riverbed to reach the nearest health centre. Ambulances take detours to help victims. The new bridges have ended our ordeal,” said G. Pandi, a motorist.
The new bridges will end a detour of at least 20 kms for residents in surrounding farming villages to reach nearest towns like Polur, Arani, Chengam, and Tiruvannamalai. “The new facility will facilitate easy transport of farm produce by farmers from villages along the river. Buses can also be operated in these villages, using the new facility. The new bridges were built to withstand massive floods during monsoon,” T. Murugan, Assistant Executive Engineer (AEE), State Highways (Rural Roads), Tiruvannamalai, told The Hindu.
Minister for Public Works E.V. Velu inaugurated the bridges in the presence of Deputy Speaker of Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly, K. Pitchandi, and Collector K. Tharpagaraj.
Funded by NABARD under the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) 2022-23, the three new bridges, which cost ₹36.11 crore together, are 167.44 metres long and 8.40 metres wide each — enough for two buses to use it at a time.
As the Cheyyar and Then Pennai rivers witness flow of excess rainwater during monsoon, the new bridges were built at a height of 4.93 metres from the riverbed to prevent inundation of the carriageway and damage to its structure. The bridges have tiled footpaths, LED lights, inlets to discharge rainwater into the river, reflectors, sign boards, and hand railings.
The bridges are a lifeline for surrounding villages including Annaivadi, Kalur, Seethmpatty, Pathiyavadi, Salaianur, Annilai, and Kovur.

--------------------
A delegation of Praja Arogya Vedika met Finance Minister Payyavula Keshav and Health, Medical Education and Family Welfare Minister Satya Kumar Yadav in Amaravati on February 11(Wednesday) and submitted a memorandum seeking a substantial increase in allocations to the health sector in the 2026-27 Budget.
In a press statement, PAV president M. V. Ramanaiah and general secretary T. Kameswar Rao said the memorandum underscored what they described as persistently low public health spending in Andhra Pradesh. They stated that the 2025-26 Budget provided ₹19,264 crore for health, which works out to about 1.05% of the GSDP and is significantly lower than the benchmarks suggested in the National Health Policy 2017 and by the World Health Organisation.
They said inadequate funding had resulted in gaps in primary and preventive healthcare, shortage of human resources, weak rural and tribal infrastructure, and insufficient measures to address malnutrition and anaemia among women and children.
Among the key demands, the organisation sought an increase in health allocation to at least 2.5% of the GSDP, which would require an additional ₹20,000 to ₹25,000 crore over the previous outlay. It also called for prioritising primary and preventive healthcare, introducing a special health package for tribal areas, strengthening the Public Distribution System to tackle high levels of malnutrition, filling vacancies and bridging infrastructure gaps, upgrading 104 and 108 emergency services, and clearing pending payments under NTR Vaidya Seva.
The delegation expressed concern over what it termed excessive dependence on privatisation and public private partnership models in the health sector. It demanded development of RCD Hospital in Visakhapatnam into a super specialty children’s hospital, strengthening of AIIMS at Mangalagiri, expansion of the Kakani Cancer Data Centre, and upgrading VIMS into a postgraduate and research centre.
The members urged the government to focus on publicly funded and equitable healthcare rather than medical tourism or high-end public private partnerships, which they cautioned could widen inequalities. They also appealed to Opposition MLAs to highlight these issues during the discussion on the State Budget in the ongoing Assembly session.

Opposition members in the Lok Sabha expressed their concerns over low per capita income, growing inequality, and unemployment while speaking on the Union Budget. “No economy can grow in an atmosphere of fear and hatred,” Congress MP K.C. Venugopal said, taking part in the debate on the Union Budget.
Mr. Venugopal claimed that as many as 80 churches had been attacked during the 2025 Christmas season, and referred to a controversial statement by a Chief Minister targeting a minority group in his State. The name of the CM was removed from the record of the proceedings.
Mr. Venugopal also flagged the issue of the Indian rupee crossing the ₹91 mark against the U.S. dollar, unemployment rate among urban youth reaching 18%, and the top 10% of the population controlling 58% of the country’s resources. The rights-based approach of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA), reflected in laws, including the erstwhile Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), Right to Information (RTI) Act, and the Forest Rights Act, are being diluted or taken away.
“The Finance Minister will proudly speak of growth and development. But behind these claims lie these harsh realities,” he said. The Congress member from Kerala’s Alappuzha constituency asked why his State did not yet have an All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), despite having been promised one back in 2014.
The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Anurag Thakur, speaking soon after the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, targeted the latter. “The electoral losses have filled him with hatred. He hates parliamentary rules, he hates the Speaker, he hates Constitutional institutions, he hates the Prime Minister, and now he has started hating India,” Mr. Thakur said.
In the Rajya Sabha, Opposition members flagged concerns over growing income inequality. Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) MP Sanjay Yadav noted that while India is now the world’s fourth-largest economy, it ranks much lower on the per capita income scale.
Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) MP V. Sivadasan sought to counter the government’s claims of India being a high‑growth economy, arguing that wages for ASHA and anganwadi workers had not been revised for a decade. Social welfare pensions, he said, had also remained unchanged for more than 10 years.
“The government likes to tell us we are the world’s fourth‑largest economy. But what it doesn’t tell people is that in terms of per capita GDP, our economy ranks 123rd,” Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Saket Gokhale, citing official data, said. “The problem with the BJP is that one leg is in 1947 and the other in 2047. There is nothing in the present,” Mr. Gokhale, taking a swipe at the ruling party.
The Union Budget had become “personality‑oriented” rather than policy‑driven, he alleged, claiming that urban Indian youth now had lower purchasing power than young people in several conflict‑hit countries.
Congress MP Rajeev Shukla criticised the India-U.S. interim trade deal, questioning the government’s portrayal of it as a success. “Now they are saying an 18% tariff is an achievement,” he said, adding that economists had warned the agreement was tilted in favour of the U.S.
Restrictions on Russian oil imports could push up fuel prices, Mr. Shukla said. Economic growth alone is insufficient, former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda said, stressing that employment must be central to policy-making. Was success being measured by investment announcements or by the creation of dignified jobs, especially in smaller towns and rural areas, Mr. Gowda said.

TITLE: Ahead of March 31 deadline, Odisha revises surrender and rehabilitation scheme for surrendering Maoists

--------------------
Making the sixth revision to its ‘Surrender and Rehabilitation of Left-Wing Extremists’ scheme in the past two decades, the Odisha Government has announced financial incentives for mainstreaming of persons native to the State who are involved in Maoist activities irrespective of where they surrender to the authorities.
After substantially increasing reward money for surrendered left-wing extremists (LWEs) in November last year, the Mohan Majhi Government has relaxed the eligibility criteria for surrendering Maoist cadres. The State police, in coordination with Central security forces, have stepped up their efforts to bring Maoist activities down to zero by March 31, a deadline set by the Union Home Ministry.
“Persons native to Odisha State, who are active in the activities of the above organisations outside the State of Odisha, will be considered eligible for surrender if their involvement is certified by the concerned Superintendent of Police,” says the notification issued on February 9.
“It will be necessary to obtain a no objection certificate from the concerned State that such surrendered person has not been provided rehabilitation facilities in concerned State,” the Odisha Government elaborated explaining the condition.
The rehabilitation scheme for surrendered LWEs will, however, be applicable to persons who may or may not be a native of Odisha but are involved in activities of the banned CPI (Maoist) in the State.
In November last year, Odisha revised upwards the reward money to ₹1.10 crore for Central Committee Member, Politburo Member or Central Military Commission Member laying down arms as per Surrender and Rehabilitation of Left Wing Extremists. It is said to be financially better than the scheme run by Chhattisgarh, currently the worst LWE-impacted State in India.
Similarly, a State Committee Member (SCM) or Special Zonal Committee Member (SZCM) or Regional Committee Member is entitled to receive ₹55 lakh and Divisional Committee Secretary will get ₹33 lakh in the event of surrender.
If the surrendered Maoists are a couple, the husband and wife will be considered as separate units, and both will be given the benefits of the rehabilitation scheme. Earlier this month, State Committee Members Nikhil alias Niranjan Rout and his wife, Ankita alias Rashmita Lenka, had surrendered before security forces. They would get ₹55 lakh each for mainstreaming as they have been treated as separate units.
There have been elaborate financial rewards for giving up firearms depending on their degree of fire power. The government has announced it would pay ₹4.95 lakh for light machine gun while ₹3.30 lakh has been fixed for AK-47.
In order to wean away the misguided youth who joined CPI (Maoist) and its frontal organisations, the government had first approved the scheme back in 2006. It was further improved with revisions in 2012 and 2014.
After revisions in November last year, 45 LWEs have surrendered before security forces, while there are still 40 cadres, including a State Committee Member, active in the State. Movements of LWEs have been noticed in Kandhamal, Kalahandi, and Rayagada districts, said a senior officer involved in ant-Maoist operations.
Apart from the State’s own policy, the MHA had in 2022 issued revised guidelines for surrender and rehabilitation of LWEs with financial assistance and provision for employment and entrepreneurial opportunity.

Government officials, academicians, and industry leaders will come together at the The Hindu Group’s Tech Summit 2026 on February 12 and 13 to deliberate on various issues at the intersection of technology and governance, building resilience in industry, and the challenges and opportunities from Artificial Intelligence.
Titled ‘Continuity Unbroken: Building the Architecture of Resilience in a Connected World’, the summit’s first day will focus on enterprise resilience and governance with key features being data privacy in biometric platforms, technology-led disaster recovery, evolution of next-generation governance and compliance frameworks, and cyber resilience in an AI-driven world. The second day will examine topics like AI-first digital transformation, integrated data security management, state perspectives on technology-driven economic growth, and the development of industry-ready talent for an AI-driven future.
The event will be inaugurated by G. Viswanathan, Founder and Chancellor, Vellore Institute of Technology. He will also deliver the keynote address. Raju Vegesna, Chairman and Managing Director, Sify Technologies, will deliver a special address.
Industry leaders, policymakers, technology architects, and academicians will engage in conversations, panel discussions, and strategic dialogues exploring resilience not merely as risk mitigation but as a structural capability embedded within organisational DNA.
Dr. Viswanathan said that India had long excelled in theoretical knowledge but had often fallen short in practical knowledge. “A leading model we can draw inspiration from is Germany,” he said, adding that, in Germany, candidates seeking to teach in universities of applied sciences are required to have at least five years of professional experience. Stating that VIT was one of the first institutions to have mandated that a part of every course was to be delivered by industry experts, Dr. Viswanathan pointed out that the institution had ensured that industry professionals and senior leaders actively participated at various levels, including the Academic Council and the curriculum design committee.
The summit is supported by Skylar Information Technologies, KBR, Tally, and Virtusa as associate partners; G Square as realty partner; CIO as knowledge partner; MMA as industry partner: Startup Singam as ecosystem partner; Nexus as gift partner; and the Government of Karnataka as State partner.

The MHA said the instructions are being issued for general information and guidance on the official version of the song, the occasions on which it is to be played or sung, and the need for paying respect to the song by observance of proper decorum on such occasions. File
The Union government has said in a set of instructions to States and other government bodies that the national song Vande Mataram should be sung or played before the national anthem Jana Gana Mana when both the songs are played at an event.
The fresh set of guidelines were uploaded on the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) website on February 6 but no formal announcement or a statement was issued.
It states that whenever the official version of the national song, around 3.10 minutes long, is sung or played, the audience shall stand to attention. “However, when in the course of a newsreel or documentary, the national song is played as a part of the film, it is not expected of the audience to stand as standing is bound to interrupt the exhibition of the film and would create disorder and confusion rather than add to the dignity of the national song,” it said.
The MHA said the instructions are being issued for general information and guidance on the official version of the song, the occasions on which it is to be played or sung, and the need for paying respect to the song by observance of proper decorum on such occasions.
It said that the song Vande Mataram written by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee is known as the “national song which is to be sung on arrival and departure of the President at formal State functions and other functions organised by the government, immediately before and after the President addresses the nation over All India Radio and television, on arrival and departure of the Governor/Lieutenant Governor at formal State functions, when the national flag is brought on parade, any other occasion for which special orders are issued by the Government of India”.
“When the national song is played by a band, the song will be preceded by a roll of drums to assist the audience to know that it is going to be played, unless there is some other specific indication that the national song is about to be played,” the Ministry said in the guideline.
The official version shall be played accompanied by mass singing on the unfurling of the national flag, on cultural occasions or ceremonial functions other than parades. The mass singing could be arranged by having a choir of adequate size, suitably stationed, which would be trained to coordinate its singing with the band, etc. There should be an adequate public audition system so that the gathering in various enclosures can sing in unison with the choir while printed lyrics of the official version of the song may be circulated amongst the participants, wherever required, the MHA said.
It may be sung on occasions which, although not strictly ceremonial, are nevertheless invested with significance because of the presence of Ministers, etc., the Ministry stated.
“It is not possible to give an exhaustive list of occasions on which the singing (as distinct from playing) of official version of the national song can be permitted. But there is no objection to the singing of the national song accompanied by mass singing so long as it is done with due respect as a salutation to the motherland and proper decorum is maintained,” the MHA said.
“In all schools, the day’s work may begin with community singing of the national song. School authorities should make adequate provision in their programmes for popularising the singing of the national song, national anthem and promoting respect for the national flag among students,” the MHA added.

The Hyderabad Disaster Response and Asset Protection Agency (HYDRAA) removed encroachments into government lands in Jubilee Hills and Khanamet on Wednesday.
In Jubilee Hills, 150 square yards of a two acre park land was encroached upon by a tenant running a ladies’ hostel at a house nearby. A statement from the HYDRAA said that the person has constructed rooms in 50 square yards of land, abutting the existing building. A 100 square yards more was fenced off and used as a private park.
Following complaints from local residents in Prajavani, officials, after a field inspection along with GHMC authorities, confirmed the encroachment, demolished the structure and erected fencing. A police case was registered.
In a separate case, five acres allotted by the government to the All India Velama Association near Hitec Exhibition Grounds in Khanamet was secured from encroachments. After the High Court granted a stay on the allotment following objections, association representatives complained of attempts by locals to encroach upon the land. HYDRAA conducted an inspection and fenced the five-acre parcel, installing signboards to prevent encroachment pending the court’s decision.

Home Minister G. Parameshwara on Wednesday vowed to make Karnataka drug-free and said, “We will not let Karnataka become another Punjab in terms of drugs. The public should not allow this either. Everyone should come together to build a drug-free Karnataka”.
Speaking at the Narcotics Control Bureau’s ‘Narcotics-Free India, Narcotics-Free Karnataka, Narcotics-Free Campus and Organ Donation’ campaign, organised by Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (RGUHS) in collaboration with Dishabodh Foundation on Wednesday, he said the government has seriously considered making the State drug-free. “The Higher Education Minister will be instructed to take necessary steps to curb this at the government level,” he added.
Appreciating the efforts by the university, the Home Minister stated that to build a drug-free State, college campuses must be drug-free. “The campaign by RGUHS is an important one, and the State government will support it completely,” Dr. Parameshwara said
Further, Dr. Parameshwara directed the University to instruct all affiliated colleges under it to constitute Anti-Drug Committees. “There are over 1500 colleges under RGUHS and if any college fail to constitute anti-drug committee, then measures should be taken to withdraw their affiliation,” He stated.
Taking part in the event, Health and Family Welfare Minister Dinesh Gundu Rao shared that the government is seriously thinking of increasing number of Organ Retrieval centres at government hospitals.
Dr. Bhagawan B.C., Vice-Chancellor of RGUHS, requested the government to establish Organ Retrieval centres at all government medical college hospitals and strengthen the already established centres.

Andhra Pradesh Congress president Y. S. Sharmila on Wednesday launched a sharp attack on the Governor’s Budget address, describing it as hollow, directionless and replete with exaggerated and misleading claims.
In a post on X, she said the address offered no concrete roadmap for the State’s development and was largely a reiteration of the ruling coalition’s election promises, while glossing over what she termed 19 months of administrative failures. She alleged that the coalition government lacked vision, prudence and balance in governance.
Ms. Sharmila questioned the government’s claims on poverty eradication under P4, proposed investments worth ₹13 lakh crore and generation of 20 lakh jobs, terming them inflated. She further alleged that the Universal Health Policy had diluted the Aarogyasri scheme, thereby affecting healthcare access for 1.43 crore families. She also faulted the government over the reduction of the Polavaram project height to 41.15 metres and accused it of neglecting several pending irrigation projects.

Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Wednesday (February 11, 2026) slammed Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for "passing innuendo" against him, asserting that he had met Jeffery Epstein on a "few occasions" but his interactions with him had nothing to do with the crimes the convicted American sex offender was involved in.
Mr. Puri's clarification came after Mr. Gandhi claimed that the Union Minister's name has also figured in 'Epstein Files' released in the U.S.
Addressing a press conference in New Delhi, Mr. Puri said, "After I resigned as India's ambassador to the UN, I was invited to join the International Peace Institute (IPI) a few months later. I was not part of the IPI per se. I was secretary general of the Independent Commission (ICM) on Multilateralism, set up in the IPI as a project."
"My boss in the IPI, Terje Rod-Larsen, was the person who knew this particular infamous person Mr. Epstein and it is as part of a delegation of the IPI or the ICM that I met Mr. Epstein on a few occasions, three or maximum four," he added.
Mr. Puri said the ICM was dealing with international and thematic issues and Epstein was not part of it.
He said Epstein was alleged to have committed several criminal offences and there were charges that he had an island where he used to take people to indulge in "their sexual fantasies".
"There are victims of this. These victims have brought cases against the people in authority," he said asserting that his interactions with Epstein had "nothing to do with this".
Mr. Puri said that he had apprised Mr. Gandhi about this by sending him a "note" last year.
"On the Samvidhan Divas on November 26 last year, I was there at the central hall of the old Parliament building. After the event [organised to mark Samvidhan Divas] concluded, he [Rahul Gandhi] came up to me and winked at me in his style," Mr. Puri said.
"I was also amused... He said 'your name is in interesting places'. I asked him do you want to know what the facts are? Do you want a note on it? So I sent him a note," the Minister added.
Mr. Puri accused Mr. Gandhi of indulging in "buffoonery" now and told the reporters, "This innuendo and smear campaign has given me a privilege and the opportunity to talk to you and place the facts before you."
Mr. Puri also said he had sent an e-mail to LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman with a copy to Epstein on November 13, 2014, conveying his view that India presents a "terrific opportunity" for internet-based economic activity.
Reading out the excerpts of his email, the Union Minister said that he also suggested Mr. Hoffman to visit to India to see the changes happening.
"It's a long email. Anybody wants its copy, it's available on the internet, the DOJ...This is the only substantive e-mail. There are one or two also. I will give you," he said.
Mr. Puri cited another email between Mr. Larsen and Jeffrey Epstein and said, "Epstein here refers to me as two-faced... I was certainly not good in their value system because they were dealing in something else." 	"Rahul should have read it," he added.

--------------------
HYDERABAD
Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) working president K.T. Rama Rao on Wednesday sharply criticised the ruling Congress, alleging large-scale misuse of power and intimidation during the municipal elections. He accused Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy of resorting to ‘excesses and atrocities’ out of fear of electoral defeat.
In a press statement, Mr. Rao said the Congress government had created obstacles for voters and attempted to influence them through inducements. Despite these alleged pressures, he praised BRS workers for displaying remarkable courage and determination throughout the polling process. “My heartfelt congratulations to every party worker for their fighting spirit and commitment,” he said.
He added that the resilience shown by the cadres had infused new energy and confidence into the party during the municipal battle.
Mr. Rao claimed that the Congress leadership, rattled by the setback in the recent Gram Panchayat polls, feared similar losses in urban areas and therefore misused administrative machinery at various stages of the elections. He also alleged that the ruling party was attempting to sway public opinion using thousands of crores of ill-gotten money.
He warned that people would not remain silent in the face of such actions. Accusing the government of targeting BRS cadre, he said the police system was being misused to harass and attack party workers. Mr. Rao predicted that the Chief Minister would soon face the consequences for these alleged violations.

“Dr. Ravi Pillai Academic Excellence Scholarship” will provide wide opportunities for academic achievements, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said.
He was speaking after inaugurating a function for distribution of the scholarships at Nishangandhi auditorium here on Wednesday.
The Chief Minister said today the education sector in Kerala was a model for the country. However, the State had a dark phase where the education right was denied to many. The struggles by social reformers and national, progressive, and political movements led to the formation of a united Kerala in which the first government led by E.M.S. Namboodiripad scrapped fee to make education free up to upper primary. The second EMS government made secondary education free too. Government interventions in the higher education sector also paved the way for development of education in the State. Continuing these efforts, the government decided to make education free up to the graduate level, the Chief Minister said.
He urged students to be vigilant against attempts to promote caste-religious enmity. Students should retain their humanity to work for the good of society. They must resist drugs and pledge not to engage in substance abuse, he said.
In the first phase, scholarships to the tune of ₹10 crore will be distributed to 1,501 students. An amount of ₹525 crore for the next 50 years had been set aside for the scheme, being implemented by industrialist Ravi Pillai as part of social responsibility.
The Chief Minister noted that though Mr. Pillai was a prominent name globally, the scholarship scheme for students was a testimony to his ties with the State. The scholarships would help students from economically weak backgrounds to reach for higher education opportunities, he said.
The scholarship will be given by the Dr.Ravi Pillai Foundation in association with NoRKA Roots to students from secondary school level to professional colleges. At the higher secondary level, 1,100 students will get ₹50,000 each. As many as 200 undergraduate students will get ₹1 lakh each, and 200 postgraduate students will get ₹1.25 lakh each.
Minister for Revenue K. Rajan presided over the function. Mr. Pillai, who is also the NoRKA director, and NoRKA executive vice-chairperson P. Sreeramakrishnan were present.

TITLE: Let routine policing work not suffer because of impending elections in Tamil Nadu, cautions Madras High Court

--------------------
The judge called for a status report from the police by February 25, 2026.
The Madras High Court on Wednesday  cautioned that the regular policing work in the State should not suffer because of the impending Legislative Assembly election and that the police should not end up citing elections as a reason for every other delay in performing their routine work.
Justice N. Anand Venkatesh sent across the message during the hearing of a 2024 case. He embarked on a venture to find a  solution to prevent youngsters from indulging in reckless riding and driving of motorcycles and cars on public roads, by roping in the police as well as counsellors for reforming the youth.
After finding that not much had happened after the Schizophrenia Research Foundation (SCARF) in Chennai conducted a study in collaboration with SAMVAD, an initiative of the Union Ministry of Women and Child Development, in 2025, the judge called for a status report from the police by February 25
“The problem now is that all the police officials will be focused on elections. The entire State will come to a standstill. The executive and everybody will be looking after elections. So, what will happen to others? What will happen to bike racing, what will happen to people who die?” the judge asked a government advocate.
“The police department need not be completely immersed in the election process. Their job is only supportive. They only need to maintain law and order. Now the complaint is that the study report of SCARF and SAMVAD is not being followed up by the police. So, you file a status report by [February] 25,” the judge said.
It was in March 2024, while dealing with a petition filed by two youngsters to quash a criminal case booked against them for rash riding, the judge had sought the assistance of the Greater Chennai Traffic Police (GCTP) and State Public Prosecutor Hasan Mohamed Jinnah to reform youngsters aged between 18 and 25.
The then Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic), R. Sudhakar, had told the court that the GCTP regularly stations three interceptor vehicles mounted with Automatic Number Plate Recognition cameras on ECR, Old Mahabalipuram Road or Kamarajar Salai, and Koyambedu-Maduravoyal Road to detect and catch vehicles that indulge in stunts or racing.
Stating that the GCTP also maintains a database of old offenders involved in racing since 2022, the Additional Commissioner said 107 bonds had so far been executed by the violators for keeping good behaviour, and since most of them were teenagers, their parents had been informed of the violations.
After taking note of the submissions, the court initiated a scientific study by SCARF and SAMVAD to understand the psyche of the youngsters indulging in dangerous behaviour on public roads since 1.68 lakh people had lost their lives and 4.43 lakh had suffered injuries in 4.61 lakh road accidents reported in the country in 2022 alone.
The study titled ‘Development of Risk-Reduction & Related Behaviours Change Interventions for Youth Traffic Offenders’ was conducted by both the organisations together, and a detailed report was submitted in April 2025 for the police department to prepare a module to deal with young traffic offenders.

The State government has decided to develop the Beypore port in Kozhikode in the public-private-partnership (PPP) mode.
The decision was taken at the State Cabinet meeting held in Thiruvananthapuram on Wednesday (February 11, 2026). A release quoting the office of P.A. Mohamed Riyas, Minister for Public Works and Tourism, who is also the MLA for Beypore, said the step would help Beypore develop as a port city. The proposal is to spend over ₹2,000 crore for various works. The Kerala State Maritime Board will implement the project.
Sources said that meeting involving residents would be held in the coming days to ensure their participation. Tender procedures would commence soon, they added. The project is expected to create jobs both for local residents and others. Mr. Riyas also held a meeting with V.N. Vasavan, Minister for Ports, to discuss its possibilities.
Meanwhile, Mr. Riyas said in a release that the project would boost the movement of goods through large containers, and that related businesses would get a fillip. New jobs would be created, and existing labourers would also get benefited. Mr. Riyas added new roads and bridges would be constructed, and Beypore would soon become a ‘designed city’.

--------------------
Kerala’s Responsible Tourism (RT) has been recognised globally for strengthening women empowerment and supporting rural economy through sustainable and inclusive initiatives, Tourism Minister P.A. Mohamed Riyas said here on Wednesday. He was speaking after inaugurating a five-day Kerala Responsible Tourism Festival on Kanakakkunnu Palace grounds in the city.
With 26,000 RT units across Kerala, around 1.5 lakh families are direct beneficiaries of the RT mission’s various projects across the State, said the Minister.
The fact that 80% of the RT units are led by women shows the success of Kerala’s gender-inclusive tourism and the State’s commitment towards UN’s Gender Inclusive Tourism policy, said Mr. Riyas. In 2025-26, the State Budget earmarked an amount of ₹4 crore rupees for women entrepreneurs for providing loans up to 15 lakhs at an interest rate of 4%, he said. Also, 50% of the total Budget allocated for RT mission is set apart for women, he added.
Responsible tourism had also been an integral component of Kerala Tourism’s accelerated growth in recent years. Kerala Tourism has received around 14 awards in national and international level for its initiatives in RT, added Mr. Riyas. The RT mission has made possible diverse experiences for travellers such as agri farm tourism, food tourism and projects that link tourism with cultural and ecological conservation that elevate rural destinations like Kanthalloor and Beypore to global level, the Minister noted.
The five-day festival aims to give a strong market support to RT units, facilitating them to sell their products and also seek new business opportunities by collaborating with tour operators, vloggers, resort owners etc.
At the event, a memorandum of understanding for implementing interest subvention scheme for women in RT units was exchanged by Women Development Corporation managing director Bindu V.C. and Rupeshkumar K., CEO, Kerala Responsible Tourism Mission Society. The festival serves as a venue for RT units from across Kerala to showcase their initiatives that took tourism to the grassroot-levels as a sustainable and inclusive economic activity with active participation of local communities.
A range of traditional products and artifacts, bearing the imprint of RT units from different parts of Kerala, are exhibited at the festival, which has around 120 stalls selling products made by members and artisans of RT units. Food stalls dishing out full-course meals and delicacies from different parts of Kerala at the festival promises visitors a rare opportunity to relish authentic cuisine from up north Kasaragod to the State capital.

--------------------
The controversy surrounding the former Army Chief’s book has deepened, with sources indicating that the publication was allegedly released without mandatory clearance from the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and first sold on online platforms in Canada, Australia, Germany and the United States.
According to sources, the initial investigation following the registration of a case points to a “well-planned conspiracy". It is learnt that the book was leaked in a coordinated manner, bypassing the MoD’s mandatory clearance process for publications involving serving or former defence personnel.
Investigators have found that copies of the book began circulating on online platforms in Canada, Australia, Germany and the US before surfacing elsewhere. Sales are said to have started in these countries first, raising questions about the publishing and distribution chain.
The Special Cell has registered an FIR under sections pertaining to criminal conspiracy. The scope of the probe has now been expanded internationally, covering the US, Canada, Germany and Australia.
A thorough investigation into the digital trail, publishing network and possible international links is currently underway. Sources said the probe is intensifying, with agencies examining overseas connections and coordination in the alleged leak and distribution of the book.
Amid the row, Penguin Random House India, which holds the publishing rights to Four Stars of Destiny, issued a clarification stating that the book has not been published in any format.
The publisher said that an announced title, a pre-order listing and a published book are distinct stages, and that a book is considered published only when it is available for purchase across retail channels.
The entire row over the book erupted in Parliament when Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi referred to alleged contents of General (Retd.) MM Naravane’s unpublished memoir and displayed what he claimed was a copy of the book in the Lok Sabha.
His remarks triggered strong objections from treasury benches, with BJP leaders questioning how an unpublished manuscript was accessed and cited in the House. The episode led to heated exchanges, walkouts and demands for clarification, bringing the status of the book’s publication and its alleged leak into sharp political focus.

TITLE: Arunachal Dam Project Gets Eco Go-Ahead After 3 Decades, At The Cost Of 23 Lakh Trees | Exclusive

--------------------
The Centre’s expert panel has recommended environmental clearance for the Kamala hydroelectric project, a 1,720-MW storage dam proposed in the forested districts of Arunachal Pradesh.
Three decades in the making, the dam project, however, comes with strong warnings over large-scale deforestation and the need for strict ecological safeguards as more than 23 lakh trees will have to be felled.
The dam project – proposed by NHPC Ltd – involves the construction of a concrete gravity dam at a height of 216 metres on Kamala River, which is a tributary of the Subansiri and part of the Brahmaputra basin.
The dam and its reservoir will spread across 3,858 hectares in Kamle, Kra Daadi and Kurung Kumey districts, most of which are covered by dense forests.
After recently examining the proposal, the expert appraisal committee (EAC) noted that the dam project is in category ‘A’ of the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification, 2006 – this requires clearance at the central level.
While recommending approval, the EAC flagged what it called a serious environmental concern: the proposed felling of over 23 lakh trees.
“The project is located in a very dense forest area," the committee observed, stressing that such large-scale deforestation will require carefully planned mitigation and ecosystem restoration measures.
It said a detailed action plan must be prepared in consultation with state forest and wildlife departments, ecological experts and local communities before forest clearance can be considered.
The social footprint is also significant. According to official documents, 126 villages across three districts will be affected with at least 30,000 people living in the impacted area.
The broader study area covers 377 villages across four districts. The NHPC, however, has argued that the project serves strategic and economic goals.
Designed as a storage-based hydropower project, the Kamala dam is expected to provide daily peaking power and play a role in flood moderation in the downstream Brahmaputra basin. The design includes a 15-metre flood cushion above the full reservoir level to help manage monsoon floods.
The project has been in the pipeline for nearly three decades with initial investigations carried out by the Brahmaputra Board in 1996. This was followed by feasibility and detailed project reports by NHPC in 2004. Several alternative dam sites and designs were examined before the current alignment was finalised, with engineers citing better geology and safety as key reasons for the final choice.
The estimated cost of the Kamala hydroelectric project is Rs 23,764 crore. While the EAC’s recommendation clears a key regulatory hurdle, final forest clearance remains pending.
Environmental groups and local residents are expected to closely monitor the next steps, as the project moves from paper approvals to decisions that will reshape large swathes of Arunachal Pradesh’s forest landscape.

--------------------
Bharat Bandh on 12th February 2026 live updates: A nationwide ‘bandh’ has been called by a joint forum of 10 trade unions on Thursday, February 12, to protest against the economic policies of the central government.
The ‘bandh’ is expected to be joined by around 30 crore workers, which is likely to disrupt multiple facilities, including banks, transportation, and other services.
Addressing the media, All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) General Secretary Amarjeet Kaur said the scale of participation is expected to surpass previous mobilisations.
“Not less than 30 crore workers will join the strike on February 12. During the July 9, 2025 protest, around 25 crore workers took part,” she said.
Protests Over India-US Trade Deal
The ‘bandh’ has also been backed by farmer organisations. Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SMK) has criticised the recent trade deal between India and the United States, alleging the Narendra Modi-led government surrendered before the “shrewdness of the US”.
“Agreement will be a betrayal against farmers… We are surrendering before the shrewdness of US. The Governmet has surrendered. Piyush Goyal should resign. He betrayed Indian farmers. On this basis, we have started a campaign, from 4th February to 11th February SKM will go to farmers. On 12th, Bharat Bandh has been called over this,” SKM Convenor Hannan Mollah told news agency ANI.
The nationwide strike called by trade unions against the Centre’s Labour Codes threw normal life out of gear across Kerala on Thursday, with transport services being hit and attendance in government offices expected to be low.
Although no official circular has issue in regard to the closure of banks in Delhi in view of the nationwide strikes, customers are advised to contact their bank branch for updates.
In Odisha’s Bhubaneswar, the Odisha State Committee of the Trade Union Co-Ordination Centre participated in the nationwide strike called by several trade unions.
The Samyukt Kisan Morcha has backed the strike, and agricultural workers’ unions are joining the protests with demands including restoration of MGNREGA and rollback of the Viksit Bharat – Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Act, 2025, also referred to as G RAM G.
LoP and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Thursday backed the nationwide call for ‘Bharat Bandh’, asserting his support to the protesting farmers and trade unions.
आज देशभर में लाखों मजदूर और किसान अपने हक़ की आवाज़ बुलंद करने सड़कों पर हैं।
मजदूरों को डर है कि चार श्रम संहिताएँ उनके अधिकारों को कमजोर कर देंगी।
किसानों को आशंका है कि व्यापार समझौता उनकी आजीविका पर चोट करेगा।
और मनरेगा को कमजोर या खत्म करने से गांवों का आख़िरी सहारा भी…

The Department of School Education and Literacy on Wednesday stated that schools across Karnataka will function normally today and will not be affected by the Bharat Bandh.
“District commissioners are also allowed to take decisions in case of any untoward incidents,” said Vikas Kishor Suralkar, Commissioner for School Education.
After the nationwide strike called by various trade unions against various policies of the central government and the India-US trade deal, the LDF government in Kerala has declared a no work no pay for employees, warning them against participation in the protests.
A nationwide ‘bandh’ is expected to cause disruptions in several regions. Citizens are advised to analyse the situation in their locality and plan their travel accordingly.
In view of the ‘Bharat Bandh’ today, the Mohan Charan Majhi-led Odisha Government has directed the district collectors to take preventive measures to maintain law & order.
States including Kerala, Odisha and Karnataka are likely to see disruptions in services as trade unions are more active in these regions.
Punjab’s ruling party AAP has backed the nationwide strike called on February 12 by the central trade unions and farmer bodies. In a statement, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) announced that its cadre across Punjab and the rest of the country would join the nationwide ‘bandh’ with farmers and workers.
The Congress has extended its support to the nationwide call for ‘Bandh’ today, asserting they will firmly stand with the workers and farmers.

While the government has not made any official announcement, there might be disruptions in transport and other services.
Schools and colleges are likely to remain closed in state, including Kerala, Karnataka, and Odisha, if local bodies back the nationwide ‘bandh’. Essential services like hospitals and ambulances are likely to function normally.

TITLE: 'Unauthorised': BJP Assam Sacks Social Media Member After AI Video Shows Himanta Aiming Gun At Men
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/unauthorised-bjp-assam-sacks-social-media-member-after-ai-video-shows-himanta-aiming-gun-at-men-ws-l-9896997.html
--------------------
The Assam unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) removed one of four co-conveners from its social media department following backlash over a video that depicted Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma aiming a rifle at two men, one of whom bears resemblance to Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi.
The video, posted last Saturday on the official X (formerly Twitter) handle of Assam BJP with the caption “Point blank shot", was deleted the following day. The post showed digitally manipulated images of the Chief Minister appearing to shoot at a photograph of the two men, concluding with an image of Himanta Biswa Sarma dressed as a cowboy wielding a gun.
Assam BJP president Dilip Saikia confirmed the removal to The Indian Express, characterizing the post as an “immature" and “unauthorised" action.
“The party is concerned about illegal immigrant Bangladeshis in Assam, and for that, there has to be a movement in the society. But the party does not support the idea of a mala fide intent of targeting Muslims with bullets. It was mishandled by an immature and unauthorised person," Saikia stated.
Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma distanced himself from the video, claiming no prior knowledge of its creation or posting.
“We have registered an FIR," he said, referring to a complaint filed by Congress MLAs, adding, “In fact, one of our BJP people has also filed a case, saying that this is a video about which we are angry because in Assam, everybody knows that we are not against Assamese Muslims. We are against Bangladeshi Muslims, whom we call Miya Muslims."
The controversy marks the second time in recent months that the Assam BJP’s X handle has faced scrutiny. In September 2025, the account posted an AI-generated video titled “Assam without BJP", accompanied by text references to “beef legalisation" and “illegal immigrants." The Supreme Court subsequently issued a notice in October on a petition seeking removal of the video.

TITLE: Drive To ‘Jai Ho’: Mumbai Melody Road Opens On Coastal Route, Fadnavis Hints At More Such Projects
LINK: https://www.news18.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-melody-road-opens-on-coastal-route-fadnavis-hints-at-more-such-projects-ws-l-9896917.html
--------------------
Mumbai has unveiled India’s first musical road, where motorists driving along a designated stretch of the Coastal Road can hear the iconic Bollywood song Jai Ho through specially installed grooves in the road surface.
The innovative project was inaugurated on Wednesday by Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis. Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, former Shiv Sena MP Rahul Shewale, who came up with the idea, Hungary’s Consul General Faren Jari, and BMC officials were present at the launch.
Fadnavis called the musical road as a “delightful experience" for motorists and said the concept, based on Hungarian technology, could be expanded in the future.
A post shared by News18.com (@cnnnews18)
“In the first phase, the concept has been implemented on a 500-metre stretch of the Coastal Road, and there are plans to expand the musical road concept further," Fadnavis said.
Shinde also encouraged Mumbaikars to experience the musical road and suggested that the concept could also be tried on the Samruddhi Expressway as a pilot project.
About The Mumbai Melody Road
The musical stretch has been developed on the northbound carriageway of the Coastal Road, running from Nariman Point towards Worli. Civic officials said it is located in the first lane adjoining the divider, around 500 metres after vehicles exit the Worli-bound underground tunnel.
The road features grooves or rumble strips of precise dimensions and spacing. When vehicles pass over them at 70 to 80 kmph, the vibrations from the tyres produce musical notes, forming the melody of Jai Ho, composed by AR Rahman with lyrics by Gulzar.
Signboards have been placed at 500 metres, 100 metres, and 60 metres before the stretch to alert drivers about the upcoming musical section and the required speed.
According to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), this is the fifth such musical road in the world and the first in India.
The Coastal Road, named after Dharmaveer Swarajyarakshak Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj, is a major infrastructure project aimed at easing traffic congestion and enabling faster travel, now offering a unique cultural and engineering experience.
Musical roads, also called melody roads, were first developed in Japan in 2007 and have since been implemented in countries such as Hungary, South Korea, and the UAE.
The BMC hailed the project as a blend of engineering innovation and cultural expression, giving Mumbaikars a patriotic and musical experience as they drive.

TITLE: Rajnath Singh-Led Top Defence Body Likely To Clear Acquisition Of 114 Rafale Jets, Key Meeting Tomorrow
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/rafale-fighter-jets-acquisition-iaf-rajnath-singh-top-defence-body-proposal-meeting-tomorrow-ws-l-9896850.html
--------------------
India’s Defence Acquisition Council, chaired by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, is likely to approve 114 additional Rafale fighter jets for the Indian Air Force as it holds a key meeting on Thursday (February 12).
The meeting will have major decisions on critical military platforms, with the agenda including proposals that could reshape combat capabilities of the armed forces amid growing security concerns.
At the forefront is the likely approval of 114 additional Dassault Rafale jets for the Indian Air Force under the Medium-Role Fighter Aircraft (MRFA) programme. This proposal – cleared by the Defence Procurement Board last month – is expected to be taken up by the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) before being forwarded to the Prime Minister-led cabinet committee on security for the final nod.
The planned Rafale acquisition aims to address the steep decline in the squadron strength of the air force. The number has dropped to 29 squadrons against an authorised strength of 42, the lowest in decades. Even with the additional jets, which could translate into at least six to seven new squadrons and incoming HAL Tejas Mk-1A deliveries, the gap is unlikely to close quickly without these buys.
The MRFA project has a long and complex lineage. It evolved from the 2007 Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) competition, in which Rafale eventually emerged the preferred choice but negotiations over cost and industrial terms had stalled.
The present proposal has a stronger emphasis on ‘Make in India’, with plans for transfer of technology and local production as well as integration of future weapons systems tailored to Indian requirements. If approved, the deal – estimated to be around Rs 3.25 lakh crore – will become one of India’s largest fighter aircraft procurements.
The DAC is also expected to consider procurement of high-altitude pseudo-satellites (HAPS), which are long-endurance, solar-powered unmanned systems capable of stratospheric surveillance.
These offer persistent intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance over wide areas at considerably lower cost than traditional satellites, and are being developed by Indian entities including Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL). Their inclusion is a shift towards indigenous space-domain capability that can support frontline forces in border and maritime zones.
While sources indicated that approvals are unlikely, the DAC is widely expected to take up the case of the Boeing P-8I Poseidon fleet to approve six additional aircraft for the Indian Navy.
The P-8I, a long-range maritime surveillance and anti-submarine warfare platform, is a critical asset for securing India’s maritime interests in the Indian Ocean. The navy presently operates 12 of these aircraft, which have amassed over 40,000 mishap-free flight hours and are central to its “eye in the sky" capability.
The council will discuss some more cases for the capability boost of the armed forces, including SCALP missiles, indigenous marine engine development programme for the navy among other cases.
Delays in the indigenous LCA Mk1A programme have compounded capability shortfalls. Although at least 180 Mk1A aircraft have been contracted, deliveries – scheduled between 2027 and 2033 – have not yet begun, slowing down efforts to offset retirements of older jets such as the MiG-21 series.
These delays have sharpened the focus on rapid acquisitions like the Rafale buy while highlighting the need to speed up indigenous projects.

TITLE: Bharat Bandh Today: Transport, Banks, Schools — What’s Open, What’s Closed
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/bharat-bandh-on-february-12-transport-banks-schools-whats-open-whats-closed-ws-l-9896671.html
--------------------
A nationwide strike, also known as Bharat Bandh, has been called on Thursday, by over 10 central trade and farmers’ unions. The strike protests against labour reforms and other policies that unions say weaken workers’ rights and protections.
The bandh is likely to disrupt public sector banks, transport services, government offices, and some industries, particularly in states such as Kerala and Odisha, where union mobilisation is strong.
The strike has been called by a joint platform of ten central trade unions, including AITUC, INTUC, CITU, HMS, TUCC, SEWA, AIUTUC, AICCTU, LPF, and UTUC.
Union leaders say the bandh aims to press for stronger social security measures and protection of labour rights. They oppose the four new labour codes, arguing that these weaken workers’ rights, reduce job security, and make it easier for employers to hire and fire staff.
Other demands include scrapping the Draft Seed Bill, the Electricity Amendment Bill, and the SHANTI Act, restoring MGNREGA, and withdrawing the Viksit Bharat – Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Act, 2025, The Times of India reported.
Farmers’ Support
The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) has also extended its support, citing concerns over the India-US interim trade agreement. The group’s convenor Hannan Mollah said the deal would flood Indian markets with cheaper US imports, harming farmers’ livelihoods.
“SKM studied the Government’s Agreements with the US, EU and New Zealand. SKM has been against this since the beginning. Agreement is not beneficial for a weaker country. They will send their goods for free to our country and they will flood our markets with cheaper goods. Our country will not be able to compete with them and our farmers will be finished," Mollah noted.
AITUC General Secretary Amarjeet Kaur said around 30 crore workers are expected to join the strike across 600 districts, surpassing last year’s mobilisation of 25 crore workers.
What May Be Open And Closed
Likely Affected: Public banks and insurance offices, state transport services, government offices, PSUs, industrial units, coal and steel sectors, and MGNREGA works in protest areas.
Likely to Remain Open: Hospitals, ambulances, essential health services, metro services (depending on local admin), private offices and IT companies (state-dependent), schools and colleges (state-wise), and essential supply services like milk and pharmacies.

TITLE: Uniform Dignity: Modi Govt Gives Ex-Servicemen Status To Military Nursing Service
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/uniform-dignity-modi-govt-gives-ex-servicemen-status-to-military-nursing-service-9896652.html
--------------------
The Narendra Modi government has officially extended Ex-servicemen (ESM) status to the Military Nursing Service (MNS). This decision, notified on February 10, corrects a historic oversight by amending the Ex-servicemen (Re-employment in Central Civil Services and Posts) Rules, 1979, effectively placing nursing officers on an equal statutory footing with veterans of the Regular Army, Navy, and Air Force.
The amendment to Section 2(c)(i) of the service rules explicitly includes the Military Nursing Service of the Indian Union within the definition of “ex-servicemen." This change is not merely symbolic; it ensures that nursing personnel—who are predominantly women—receive the same post-retirement security and re-employment benefits as their combatant counterparts.
According to the Defence Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh, this reflects the government’s complete commitment to the welfare, dignity, and long-term security of women serving the nation in uniform.
As per the new guidelines, MNS veterans are now entitled to:
Reservation Quotas: 10% reservation in Group ‘C’ and 20% in Group ‘D’ Central Government posts.
Age Relaxation: The ability to deduct the total years of military service plus an additional three years from their actual age for civil job eligibility.
Employment Priority: Equal standing in recruitment processes conducted by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) and the Staff Selection Commission (SSC).
The reform follows a 2024 Supreme Court observation that MNS personnel are an integral part of the armed forces and should not be denied veteran status. Defence Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh noted that this move reflects the government’s “complete commitment to the welfare, dignity, and long-term security of women serving the nation in uniform".
For decades, MNS officers have served in frontline military hospitals, high-altitude operational zones, and hostile environments, yet faced an “ambiguity" regarding their status upon retirement. By formalising their identity as ex-servicemen, the government has underlined its position that the contribution of women to national security is primary, not secondary. This decision is being widely hailed as a core component of the broader push for women-led development within India’s defence ecosystem.

TITLE: Cabinet Ranks Surge As SC/ST Corporations Face Major Fund Cuts In Karnataka | Exclusive
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/cabinet-ranks-surge-as-sc-st-corporations-face-major-fund-cuts-in-karnataka-exclusive-ws-l-9895931.html
--------------------
There is a stark disparity in the fiscal priorities of the Karnataka government, where a surge in cabinet-rank appointments for political leaders contrasts sharply with a declining trend in funding for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe development corporations. Documents exclusively accessed by CNN-News18 reveal that at least seven key corporations dedicated to marginalised communities have seen their financial lifelines either slashed or stagnated since the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government took office. This revelation comes as the state administration faces mounting criticism for elevating over 100 party workers to cabinet status, granting them high-end perks and ministerial privileges while essential welfare programs struggle for basic liquidity.
Defending the administration’s fiscal strategy, Congress MLA HC Balakrishna admitted to the disparity while speaking to CNN-News18, though he categorised it as a necessary adjustment for the government’s flagship guarantee schemes. “It’s a slight disparity," Balakrishna stated, adding that “overall allocation to SC/ST communities remains the same." He maintained that the funds were being utilised to ensure the broader success of social welfare guarantees that also benefit these specific communities.
However, the opposition has characterised this shift as a betrayal of the very communities that helped propel the Congress to power. BJP Spokesperson GS Prashanth slammed the government for what he termed a “misuse of taxpayer money" to fund political gratification. “There are two issues to be looked at: one, definitely BJP stood for the welfare of ST SCs and allotted a good chunk of the budget," Prashanth said. “What the Congress government has done is they have reduced the allocation and used the funds meant for SC/ST development for other purposes, roughly about Rs 25,000 crore in the last two years. It is very clear that Congress’s statement about standing up for SC/STs is only for the paper; in reality, they do not believe in empowering them."
The controversy is further fueled by the timing of these cuts, as the government continues to dole out ministerial ranks to its cadre despite warnings from the Chief Minister’s own economic advisor regarding the state’s dry coffers. Prashanth further added, “At this juncture, to dole out to party workers… taxpayer money is being misused. It is very shameful that Congress has resorted to appease their party workers by using taxpayer funds. Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar have mortgaged the interest of the people of Karnataka." As the debate intensifies, the government remains under pressure to explain why political perks appear to be taking precedence over the direct financial empowerment of the state’s most vulnerable populations.

--------------------
In Arundi village of Nyamati taluk, a Class 10 student preparing for her SSLC examinations turned to the police after her father allegedly burned her textbooks and prevented her from attending school.
According to her complaint, the girl’s father, who is reportedly addicted to alcohol, had been creating disturbances at home. As the SSLC board examinations scheduled from March 18 to April 2, 2026 approached, tensions escalated. During this period, he allegedly set fire to her textbooks and notebooks and stopped her from going to school.
With exams just weeks away, the loss of study materials and disruption to her routine left the student distressed. Fearing further interference with her education, she called the emergency helpline 112 and later filed a formal complaint at the Nyamati police station.
Swift Police Response
Police officers Hemaraj and Ravikumar responded to the call and visited the family’s home as quickly as they could. They intervened and counselled the father, explaining the seriousness of his actions and the potential long-term impact on his daughter’s education.
Under the supervision of CPI Ravi of the Nyamati police station, officers ensured that the girl received new textbooks and notebooks to replace the ones that were burned. The police also contacted school authorities and requested their support to help the student continue her studies without further disruption.
Protecting a Child’s Right to Education
Police officials stressed that while domestic disagreements may occur, they must not interfere with a child’s right to education. Destroying study materials, especially during board exam preparations, can severely affect a student’s confidence and academic performance.
The timely intervention helped stabilise the situation and ensured the girl could resume her exam preparation. The incident has drawn attention within the village, with residents expressing concern over the episode, particularly given the importance of the SSLC examinations.
All that the girl wanted was to study for the upcoming board exams which in a way is a turning point in her life and career. A drunken father was about to kill that future and dream but right intervention of police and the girl seeking their help, turned the tables.

TITLE: Toll Collection Not Linked To Project Cost Recovery, Says Gadkari, Explains Factors Behind Hike
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/toll-collection-not-linked-to-project-cost-recovery-says-gadkari-explains-factors-behind-hike-ws-kl-9895663.html
--------------------
The toll collected from a road is not related to the recovery of project development cost, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways informed the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday.
Union minister Nitin Gadkari added that the revenue collected beyond the concession period is deposited in Consolidated Fund of India (CFI) and the funds provided through budgetary allocation are utilised for further maintenance, development and augmentation of national highways.
The ministry, in a written reply, said the National Highways Fee (Determination of Rates and Collection) Rules, 2008, as amended, provide a transparent framework for levy and collection of user fee, with rates linked to the length of the highway and type of vehicle uniformly across the country.
Gadkari said collection of user fee (toll) at fee plazas on National Highways is done as per the provisions of National Highways Fee Rules, 2008.
“…the fee notified as per concession agreement is collected by the concessionaire till the end of the concession period, and after the concession period is over, the fee is collected by the Central Government or the executing authority as per the fee specified…," he said.
In a separate reply, Gadkari said the increase in the amount of user fee collection at toll fee plazas on national highways depends on several factors.
“These include the annual revision of user fee, which is linked to the wholesale price index in accordance with the National Highways Fee (Determination of Rates and Collection) Rules, 2008, increase in the length of highways under tolling, the volume of traffic plying on the stretch, and the category of vehicles using the highway," he said.
In August 2025, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) had said that there is no institutional mechanism to independently evaluate whether toll charges are justified in relation to actual operation and maintenance costs or future service requirements.
The committee said it has found that toll charges on National Highways are linked to base rates first fixed in 2008 and annually revised, with a 3 per cent annual escalation, irrespective of road quality, traffic volume, or user affordability.
“… the concept of tolling in perpetuity was first introduced through an amendment to the Fee Rules in 2008, allowing continued collection of user fees even after the recovery of project costs. This provision was further clarified and codified through the 2023 amendment to the Fee Rules, which explicitly permits tolling to continue beyond the end of the concession period, thereby formalising a regime of perpetual tolling," it had said.
The committee had desired that toll collection on any highway stretch must be rationalised and substantially reduced once capital and routine maintenance costs have been recovered.
“Any continuation of tolls beyond this point should be permitted only if clearly justified and approved by the proposed independent oversight authority," the report added.
The committee also recommended that the ministry establish a tariff authority, on the lines of the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA) in the civil aviation sector, to ensure transparency and fairness in toll fixation, collection, and regulation.
This authority should be mandated to review and determine the periodicity of toll revisions based on certain parameters, it suggested.

--------------------
A special court in Goa on Wednesday acquitted BJP MLA and minister Atanasio Monserrate in a rape case registered against him nearly a decade ago.
Monserratte, who holds the revenue portfolio, was booked in 2016 for allegedly raping a minor.
Special Judge Irshad Agha has now acquitted the minister of all charges.
As per the FIR registered by the Goa police, a minor girl had alleged that she was sold to then St Cruz MLA Monserratte who drugged and raped her.
Initially, the case was registered against the minister under the Goa Children’s Act. Later, the charge was dropped and sections under the Indian Penal Code were invoked after an ossification test indicated that she was above 16 years of age.
The case was tried before the district court after the police filed a 250-page chargesheet against him. A total of 40 witnesses were examined during the trial.

--------------------
In a quiet corner of Belagavi district, Karnataka where rocky hills rise beyond fields and villages thin into scrub forest, a man has chosen a life few would imagine for themselves. He shunned the regular ‘civilized life’ and walked into forests a decade ago.
For 10 years, he has lived away from society, without cooked food, without routine comforts, and without the rhythms of conventional life. Meet Budan Khan Hosamani, aged 34, from Ugaragol village in Saundatti taluk of Belagavi district who is well known in the area as ‘Modern Day Tarzan’.
A Decade in the Hills
Nearly 10 years ago, Budan Khan walked away from home and settled in the Heggolla hill region on the outskirts of his village. Since then, he has lived largely in isolation, away from regular social contact and modern conveniences.
What sets him apart is not just his solitude, but his diet. Budan Khan survives entirely on raw leaves, plants and wild greens found in the forest.
He is said to consume nearly 80 different varieties of vegetation available in the hills. According to local accounts, he no longer eats rice, roti or any cooked food and reportedly says he cannot even look at regular meals anymore.
Reports suggest that Budan Khan began experimenting with eating leaves after observing monkeys in the forest. Over time, this practice became his only source of sustenance.
To support this lifestyle, he also practices yoga, which he believes helps him digest the raw vegetation and maintain balance in his body.
Why He Left
According to those familiar with his story, Budan Khan left home after facing pressure from his family to get married and lead a settled life. Instead of following that path, he chose solitude in the hills and adopted what he considers a natural way of living.
He says he observed monkeys and learnt what leaves to eat and what not. He walks a great distance inside the forest everyday and does a couple of exercises that he already knew to stay in good health.
Despite surviving solely on forest greens, Budan Khan reportedly maintains a well-built and fit physique. Observers have described him as having a six-pack body, a detail that has surprised many locals and drawn curiosity about his unusual diet and routine.
His parents and two brothers live in the nearby village. “We tried to convince him to come back home many times. The minute we speak about him getting married, he stops talking to us altogether. So we said, he can stay unmarried but come and live with us. He doesn’t want to come at all, he is happy in the wild. We don’t have much option when he is that stubborn, so we just left him be" says Khan’s mother.
In the hills of Belagavi, away from kitchens and crowded streets, his life continues quietly, rooted in leaves, routine and isolation.

TITLE: ‘DMK Will Form Its Own Govt’: Stalin Amid Seat-Sharing Buzz With Congress Ahead Of 2026 Polls
LINK: https://www.news18.com/politics/dmk-will-form-its-own-govt-stalin-amid-seat-sharing-buzz-with-congress-ahead-of-2026-polls-9895237.html
--------------------
Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin expressed confidence that the DMK would form the government on its own in the 2026 Assembly elections. He said the party would contest the polls in alliance with the Congress amid talk of a rift between the allies. His remarks come as seat-sharing discussions for the elections are yet to begin with the Congress.
Speaking at a news channel event, Stalin, who is seeking a second consecutive term, spoke about the challenges before the DMK, the NDA factor and his equation with Rahul Gandhi.
Dismissing rumours of tension with the Congress, Stalin said he shared a “brotherly attachment" with Rahul Gandhi. However, he did not clarify whether the DMK would share power with the Congress if the alliance returned to power.
“The DMK will form its own government," Stalin said, adding that the party was confident of making “even greater inroads" than in 2021.
“The DMK-Congress alliance is strong in Tamil Nadu. Will fight the election together. The question of sharing of power in government does not arise now," he added.
In the 2021 Assembly elections, the DMK won 133 out of 234 seats and formed the government on its own. The Congress, which contested as its ally, won 18 out of 25 seats but was not given any ministerial post.
This time, friction has surfaced between the two parties. The Congress has accused the DMK of sidelining it in the state and is demanding a larger share of seats. It has also raised the issue of power sharing if the alliance wins again.
Last month, Rahul Gandhi met DMK MP Kanimozhi. Discussions reportedly included cabinet posts, a larger share of seats and a Rajya Sabha berth. The DMK has announced that formal seat-sharing talks will begin from February 22.
Stalin launched a sharp attack on the NDA. He said the NDA was not a “double engine" but a “dabba engine" or an empty vessel.
Framing the election as another phase of the Aryan-Dravidian battle, Stalin accused the NDA of spreading “falsehoods, hate and communal tension" ahead of the polls.
“The so-called double engine is an empty vessel. It is not a double engine, but a dabba engine," he said.
Stalin alleged that the NDA was trying to widen the divide among minorities in the state. He said the people of Tamil Nadu would give the NDA a “great disappointment" for its actions and that such divisive politics had no place in the state.
The remarks come as the BJP is attempting to strengthen its position in Tamil Nadu. The party has brought the Edappadi K Palaniswami-led AIADMK and TTV Dhinakaran’s AMMK into the NDA. The PMK is also part of the alliance.

TITLE: Alwar Gets Its First Luxury High-Rise Project, Flats To Be Ready In 6 Months
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/alwar-gets-its-first-luxury-high-rise-project-flats-to-be-ready-in-6-months-ws-el-9894386.html
--------------------
Luxury high-rise flats have been launched in Alwar, Rajasthan, for the first time, marking a significant shift in the city’s residential landscape. Typically, buyers have to wait several years for possession after a residential or commercial project is formally launched. However, a newly introduced development in the city has generated considerable buzz for a different reason.
Boots, a company in the infrastructure and construction sector, has formally launched Boots Heights – Aravali Apartments, described as Alwar’s first luxury high-rise residential project.
The development signals the beginning of organised vertical living in the city.
Located in Surya Nagar, Boots Heights is being presented as the city’s first premium high-rise residential offering, designed for families and professionals seeking an elevated urban lifestyle.
The project comprises two towers, each with 15 floors and five apartments per floor, offering a total of 150 modern 2 and 3-BHK flats. The starting price is Rs 5,500 per square foot.
One of the most striking aspects of the project is the promise of possession within six months, making it one of the few ready-to-move luxury developments in the region.
The project was originally under NBCC, a government company, which has already completed the civil structure. Boots later acquired the project through auction, enabling a faster possession timeline. Buyers are expected to receive their flats within approximately six months.
The project is projected to generate revenue of Rs 150 crore.
Boots Heights is situated on the Delhi-Alwar Road (SH-25), approximately 18 kilometres from the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway. It is also close to Alwar Junction railway station, the central bus depot and the Matsya industrial area.
Its location in the peaceful neighbourhood of Surya Nagar, combined with proximity to key commercial hubs, positions it as a viable option for both end-users and investors.
Among the standout features are open views of the Aravali hills, spacious balconies, large windows and an attractive façade design expected to redefine Alwar’s skyline.
Boots Heights will offer what is described as Alwar’s largest swimming pool, along with a modern clubhouse, pickleball court, fitness and wellness zone, indoor and outdoor recreation areas, landscaped gardens and dedicated spaces for children and senior citizens.
The project includes 24×7 manned security, advanced surveillance systems, controlled entry and exit points, and modern fire safety infrastructure.
Deepak Rai, Managing Director of Boots, said that the mindset of homebuyers in Alwar is evolving. “People now want not just a house, but better design, facilities and a complete lifestyle," he said.
He added that Boots Heights has been developed with the vision of bringing a luxury living experience to Alwar that was previously associated mainly with metro cities.

TITLE: 'Gender Handbook Too Hardvard-Oriented': CJI Flags Need For Simpler Court Language In Assault Cases
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/cji-surya-kant-gender-handbook-harvard-oriented-urges-simple-court-language-sexual-assault-cases-ws-l-9894174.html
--------------------
Chief Justice of India Surya Kant on Tuesday observed that the judicial handbook detailing legal terminology was “too much Harvard-oriented" and emphasised the urgent need for language that can be understood by victims in sexual offence cases and their families.
He stressed that terms used by courts in such cases must be simple, accessible, and grounded in real-world understanding, not complex and academically tilted.
His remark came in response to submissions in the Supreme Court’s suo moto hearing challenging a controversial March 2025 judgment of the Allahabad High Court that had triggered nationwide criticism for its narrow interpretation of the elements of sexual assault involving a minor girl.
THE CONTROVERSIAL ALLAHABAD HIGH COURT ORDER
The Supreme Court’s proceedings arise out of an order passed on March 17, 2025, by a single judge of the Allahabad High Court, which held that certain acts, including grabbing the breasts of an 11-year-old victim and breaking the string of her pyjama with the intention of dragging her beneath a culvert, did not constitute the offence of rape or attempt to rape.
The accused, identified as Pawan and Akash, allegedly grabbed the breasts of the 11-year-old girl.
One of them snapped the pyjama string and attempted to drag her under a culvert, but fled after a passerby intervened.
The trial court had initially summoned the accused under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code (rape) and Section 18 of the POCSO Act (punishment for attempt to commit an offence).
The Allahabad High Court modified the summons, ruling that the facts did not prima facie make out an attempt to rape, and instead directed trial only under Sections 9 and 10 of the POCSO Act (aggravated and serious sexual assault) along with a minor charge under Section 354-B IPC (assault with intent to disrobe).
The High Court bench stated that because there was no allegation of penetrative sexual assault or sufficient evidence of a determination to commit rape, the offence could not be elevated to attempt to rape.
THEN THE SUPREME COURT TOOK A SUO MOTO CASE
In reaction to the Allahabad High Court order, the Supreme Court took up the matter on its own motion in March 2025.
The top court bench described the High Court’s reasoning as deeply problematic in terms of legal categorisation and criminal justice standards.
The bench noted that while Sections 9 and 10 of POCSO provide for punishment for serious sexual assault and that Section 354-B covers certain forms of assault, the threshold for attempt to rape had been incorrectly applied.
The Supreme Court agreed with submissions that the High Court’s interpretation did not appropriately reflect the severity and intention in the factual matrix of the incident.
During the February 10, 2026, hearing, senior advocates highlighted that judicial language must not distort or diminish the lived reality of victims, particularly in crimes of a sexual nature.
Counsel pointed out that terms such as “preparation" and “forceful penetrative sexual assault" could be confusing or misleading if applied mechanically without attention to context.
WHAT CJI KANT SAID ON JUDICIAL LANGUAGE
Reacting to these submissions, Chief Justice Surya Kant stated that the existing judicial handbook’s terms, currently too academic or foreign in orientation, cannot serve justice unless they are translated into plain language that litigants and victims can comprehend.
The Chief Justice reiterated that the goal must be clarity, dignity, and accessibility, underscoring that legal terminology should not become a barrier to justice.
“The handbook is also unfortunately too much Harvard-oriented. Dictionary assistance, we need very simple language. Common man should understand these things, even the victim’s family can understand," CJI Kant said.
He reiterated that terminology prescribed in manuals or academic texts often fails victims and their families.
“What is the right word to be chosen is the real challenge," the CJI said in court.
On whether to frame guidelines immediately, the CJI said the court would first seek a time-bound report from the National Judicial Academy, with input from domain experts and law academics.
“We will ask the National Judicial Academy to submit a time-bound report."
“Unless we dispose of the main case, the IA (Intervention Application) cannot be entertained," he said.
In response to an intervention application by the Kerala State Legal Services Authority seeking age-appropriate language for judges, the CJI stressed that first, the substantive matter involving the victim must be resolved, after which the court would move to guideline framing.
He added that judicial language must be calibrated to factual scenarios and the decency owed to victims, saying:
“Even a simplified dictionary will not be helpful. It has to be something which can even run into volumes. Work on a pan-India basis is needed."
The CJI also announced plans for periodic judicial sensitisation.

--------------------
Budget Session Of Parliament 2026 Live Updates: Lok Sabha Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday spoke on the Union Budget and India-US trade deal in the Lower House following several days of opposition protests over his earlier remarks about former Army Chief General MM Naravane’s unpublished memoir. His remarks triggered an uproar in the House, with the government accusing him of misleading the House.
Further, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju has said that the government will file a privilege notice against Rahul Gandhi, alleging that he made baseless allegations.
It is learnt that the suspension of eight Opposition MPs will remain in force. Further, the Opposition staged a walkout from the Lok Sabha over the MP suspension issue.
On Tuesday, as both Houses discussed the Budget, the Opposition MPs took the opportunity to slam the Centre over the framework of the India-United States interim trade agreement.
Further, the Opposition has submitted a no-confidence notice against Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla. Gaurav Gogoi, Deputy Leader of Congress in Lok Sabha, said the notice, signed by 118 Opposition MPs, was submitted under Article 94-C of the Constitution to the Lok Sabha Secretary-General. Notably, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) chose not to sign the notice. According to media reports, the discussion on the motion to remove the Speaker could take place on March 9.

Union Minister Pralhad Joshi responded to Rahul Gandhi’s remarks, saying that allegations against a member of the House require proper notice. He added that if the person in question is not a member, making such claims is unacceptable. Joshi criticised Gandhi’s approach, stating, “Simply bringing a piece of paper and saying, ‘I authenticate, I authenticate,’ does not make it authentic. He should understand this. He does not understand the meaning of authentication or even the rules. That is why he says anything.”
Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju accused Congress leader Rahul Gandhi of misleading the Lok Sabha on Wednesday and announced plans to file a privilege notice against him. Rijiju alleged that Gandhi’s remarks during the House proceedings contained inaccuracies that misrepresented facts.
BJP MP Anurag Thakur described the Union Budget as driving the government’s vision of a “Viksit Bharat,” calling it the “Vikas Express” propelling the nation forward. He highlighted the wide range of sectors set to benefit, noting them from A to Z, and emphasised that the government’s fiscal plan aims to ensure inclusive growth across industries and social groups.

Finding work under the employment scheme has become an uphill task for residents of Bandarugudem village in Krishna district.

Bandarugudem village in Bapulapadu mandal of Krishna district sits at a distance from the restless churn of urban Andhra Pradesh. Its narrow mud roads are worn dark by years of use, flanked by shallow drains carrying sewage and spewing out a stench that hangs heavily in the humid air.
Elderly and middle-aged women in crumpled cotton saris walk along the lanes separating small, low-roofed houses in uneven rows, their talk punctuating the hum of rural living. Except for the occasional growl of two-wheelers, there is little to signal that the world beyond the village is changing rapidly.
It is in these quiet lanes that the debate over the future of rural employment has begun to echo. Sixty-year-old Barre Jayamma stands at the end of a street speaking animatedly with a group of women. “What good is the new scheme when we are unable to utilise the full benefits of the existing one?” she asks, referring to the Union government’s decision to replace the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) with the Viksit Bharat–Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) or VB-G RAM G.
Jayamma and most women around her are unfamiliar with the finer points of the new Act. Their understanding comes from what local officials have told them, that the guaranteed number of workdays has been increased from 100 to 125 and that payment delays are being addressed. For them, the question is not about legislative nuance but about work. MGNREGA’s mandate was simple and legally enforceable - at least 100 days of wage employment in a financial year to every rural household whose adult members were willing to do unskilled manual work. But in practice, the experience varied widely.
“My cousins in villages like Chavatipalli in Nellore district, Adavinekkalam in Eluru district and even in neighbouring Ampapuram get 100 days of paid employment every year. I have to fight with local officials to find work even for two weeks.”Medabalimi DhanalakshmiJob card holder at Bandarugudem village
Fifty-year-old Medabalimi Dhanalakshmi voices her frustration. “My cousins in villages like Chavatipalli in Nellore district, Adavinekkalam in Eluru district and even in neighbouring Ampapuram get 100 days of paid employment every year. I have to fight with local officials to find work even for two weeks,” she says. Her neighbour, Chintalapudi Aluvelamma (58), got 28 days of work last financial year. “I am healthy and willing to work, but there is no work around this village,” she laments.
Bandarugudem’s problem is structural. It is one of the smaller gram panchayats in the mandal and lacks the kind of community assets that can generate sustained employment under the scheme. The village tank, once a steady source of work through desilting and bund strengthening, has been leased out for fish rearing. That decision has effectively closed off a crucial avenue of wage labour, particularly during lean agricultural seasons. Merugu Rajaratnam (53) sums up the prevailing mood: “The tank which provided us some work is gone now. Most of us need work, but there is not much around.” Peeka Adamma (40) says they had raised the issue in gram sabhas, but to no avail.

Field assistant Chelli Prasanna says that distributing limited works among 20 groups of 50 members each is a challenge. In the previous fiscal year, villagers here could only access 30 days of work.
The contrast with neighbouring Ampapuram is stark. The roads there are wider and paved, and houses are mostly pucca and arranged in neat rows. The village presents an air of relative prosperity. Ganduboyina Venkateswara Rao (65) tends to four buffaloes in a shed constructed under MGNREGA.
Inside, hay stacks lean against mud-plastered walls, some neatly tied, others scattered across the damp floor. The structure represents an asset, a tangible outcome of the programme’s emphasis on individual beneficiary works.

“The scheme allows for individual asset creation, including livestock sheds,” explains field assistant Lalitha. Such works must be included in the labour budget and annual action plan approved by the gram sabha. For Rao, the shed has been transformative. “It is more useful than I imagined,” he says, rearranging bundles of hay.
Similarly, Chilakanti Jyothi (34) opted for oil palm cultivation under the scheme and receives monthly maintenance support during the critical growth years. The programme covers pit digging, planting and irrigation structures and also provides for maintenance to ensure sapling survival.
Ampapuram has 280 job cards divided into seven groups, each with 40–50 members. Beneficiaries have reportedly completed 70–80% of their allotted workdays in the current financial year. Across the 27 villages of Bapulapadu mandal, 9,818 households received work under MGNREGA this year, with ₹10.44 crore spent on wages, says Additional Programme Officer for Bapulapadu mandal S. Ashok Kumar. He says there are no pending payments.
At the district level, N.V. Shiva Prasad Yadav, Project Director of the Krishna District Water Management Agency (DWMA), outlines the scale of implementation. In 2024–25, 139,739 households were provided employment, generating 7,580.66 lakh person-days; in 2025–26 (till date), 5,490.37 lakh person-days have been generated. Women accounted for 2,956.87 lakh person-days. Wage expenditure stood at ₹15,406.78 lakh and materials at ₹8,622.18 lakh, with an average wage of ₹280.54. Over 3,900 families completed 100 days of work this year, he says, adding that plantation activities have covered hundreds of acres and kilometres of avenue and canal stretches.
It is evident that in parts of Krishna district, MGNREGA has functioned as intended, generating employment and creating assets. Yet disparities between villages such as Bandarugudem and Ampapuram illustrate the unevenness of implementation.
Smaller panchayats with limited common land face inherent constraints. Officials attempt to bridge the gap by encouraging individual works such as private ponds for water storage. “But many small farmers are reluctant to part with scarce land,” says Ashok Kumar.
It is against this backdrop that the Union government’s move to replace MGNREGA with VB-G RAM G has sparked controversy. Opposition parties and civil society groups argue that the change represents not merely a redesign but a structural shift.
They contend that MGNREGA’s defining feature was its statutory guarantee, the legal right to demand work. Critics fear that VB-G RAM G could transform rural employment from a demand-driven entitlement into an administratively managed scheme shaped by budget allocations, notifications and technological controls.
The Congress has sharply criticised the change. Sonia Gandhi, Chairperson of the Congress Parliamentary Party, described it as an assault on farmers and rural workers. Congress Andhra Pradesh president Y.S. Sharmila has undertaken a protest yatra from Bandlapalli in Anantapur district, where MGNREG scheme was first launched in 2006, underscoring its historical significance.
Bandlapalli itself offers evidence of MGNREGA’s transformative potential. Water harvesting ponds, percolation tanks and trenches have improved groundwater levels. Cement concrete roads built under the programme have enhanced connectivity. Cheemala Peddakka, who received the first job card two decades ago, continues to work.
“The money helps me take care of my needs,” she says. For her, the scheme’s name is less important than its ability to sustain farm labourers. “It would be painful to see any dilution of the employment generation programme that has helped so many families to improve their financial condition,” she says.

LibTech India, a research and advocacy organisation focused on transparency and social protection, has examined the implications of the new Act. Its report on the impact of VG-B RAM G on Andhra Pradesh argues that even under MGNREGA, employment averaged 51.6 days per household in the State in 2024–25, with only 11% completing 100 days, suggesting fiscal and administrative rationing despite statutory guarantees.
VB-G RAM G, it warns, removes the explicit right to demand work and allows selective implementation in notified areas, potentially excluding vulnerable communities like Adivasis. The report also highlights fiscal concerns. Given existing liabilities, the State may struggle to maintain employment levels without rationing, it says.
The fears are not unfounded. Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu, in his recent meeting with the Union Home Minister Amit Shah, discussed the financial provisions of VB-G RAM G scheme. Stating that the revised 60:40 Centre-State funding ratio had put additional financial burden on the State and could adversely impact the implementation, he requested alternative financial support.
“The State government should urgently review the impact of the VB-G RAM G Act on employment security and hold broad consultations, including a dedicated Assembly debate. Based on these discussions, the State should formally urge the Union government to reconsider the framework and retain MGNREGA’s statutory employment guarantee,” says Chakradhar Buddha, senior researcher with LibTech India.

For villagers like Jayamma, these policy debates are distant abstractions. Their reality is measured in days of work secured or denied. The divergence between villages shows that implementation capacity, asset availability and administrative priorities shape outcomes as much as legislation does. MGNREGA has built ponds, sheds and roads, it has raised groundwater levels and provided income support. But it has also revealed gaps in planning and resource allocation.
The transition to VB-G RAM G raises fundamental questions: Will the new framework strengthen delivery or weaken entitlements? Can it address disparities between villages like Bandarugudem and Ampapuram? And will it preserve the core principle that rural households should have assured access to wage employment in times of need?
As Andhra Pradesh navigates this shift, the answer may lie less in rhetoric and more in ensuring that the scheme, whatever its name, remains responsive to the realities of rural workers. For the women standing at the edge of Bandarugudem’s dusty lanes, employment is a matter of survival, dignity and the promise that the State will stand by its poorest citizens.

The Southern Railway has installed digital display boards at nearly 50 important railway stations in the city as part of passenger amenities project.
While commuters welcome the digital display boards initiative, they point out that these display boards would not be of much use unless they provide real time data on the arrival of suburban trains.
The display boards have been installed at several railway stations covering all the four sections of the Chennai Division, including Velachery, Palavanthangal, Chromepet, Pallavaram, Nungambakkam, Villivakkam, Minjur, and Tiruvottiyur.
Designed with bright LED displays for high visibility, the boards remain easily readable even during peak hours and under varying light conditions, said a senior railway official.
While these newly installed display boards are supposed to replace the timetable charts by providing accurate information on train arrivals, in reality, they simply display those that were published in the timetable but the actual timing of arrival of the suburban trains varies a lot, rue the commuters.
Even before the installation of the digital display boards, the Southern Railway has been making announcements of the arrival of suburban trains through the announcement systems in several important railway stations like Guindy, Mambalam, Egmore, Perambur, Avadi, and Tiruvallur.
T. Ashutosh, a commuter boarding at Chepauk station, said the timings on the digital display boards are the same what has been published and so it is not of any big use to the commuters.
Railway activists point out that at a time when the digital display boards of the Metrorail trains linked through the GPS installed in the trains exactly predict the arrival of the metro trains in the stations. Similarly, the Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) has successfully conducted the testing of the digital display boards informing the arrival of buses in more than 18 bus stops by installing GPS in the entire fleet of 3,500 buses and linking it with the central server plans to install digital display boards in 600 bus stops of the city.
An assistant loco driver of a suburban train said in almost 50% of the electrical multiple unit (EMU) rakes, the GPS facility is available and the next railway stations are announced to the travelling commuters through the digital display boards fixed inside the EMUs.

A 32-year-old Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) functionary was among 52 party workers booked by Vandavasi South police in Tiruvannamalai on Thursday (February 12, 2026) for traffic violations, after they tried to honour the functionary with a huge garland using a crane.
Police said S. Udayakumar, an organising secretary for Tiruvannamalai West of TVK, is a native of Anakavoor village near Cheyyar town in the district and a real estate dealer. Police said as part of his 32nd birthday celebrations, Udayakumar and the TVK cadre took out a road show in his open car the previous evening on the busy stretch. The roadshow was illegal as they did not get the necessary police permission for it.
During the road show, Udayakumar halted his vehicle near the elevated corridor on the stretch when a group of supporters tried to honour him with a huge garland, using a crane. They also presented him with a sword as part of the celebrations. The incident happened around 7.15 p.m.
Police said the action by the TVK cadre affected traffic movement on the stretch. The duty police personnel, including sub-inspectors attached to Vandavasi South police K. Vinayakamurthy and S. Murugan, stopped the celebrations.
Based on a complaint by K. Srirangan, village administrative officer (VAO), Vandavasi, a case has been registered against 52 persons.  Police also seized the crane that was used to carry the garland for the celebrations. A probe is under way.

Jammu and Kashmir Minister and National Conference (NC) leader Sakina Itoo on Thursday (February 12, 2026) flagged the issue of misuse of social media platforms by politicians in J&K to tarnish images of opponents and sought a mechanism to act swiftly against such handles at par with fake news peddlers.
“If there is anyone at the top of the misuse of social media or fake news, it is politicians. They use social media platforms like Facebook to tarnish and malign the opponents. We trace many such videos to the handles of politicians and political parties first. We need to act against them first. Politicians need to control themselves first,” said Ms. Itoo, while speaking during the Zero Hour in the J&K assembly.
She said the government should hold a meeting of the Department of Information and Public Relations (DIPR) to create a mechanism to act swiftly against such handles on social media. “Currently, the DIPR does not have a mandate to seek punishment against such handles,” she added.
In a rare show of support from the Opposition BJP, legislator R.S. Pathania said the DIPR has issued 28 rebuttals in 2025. “Is there coordination between the DIPR and the J&K Police? There are umpteen channels on Facebook that have damaged the social fabric, democracy and governance. There is a doctored video about me uploaded by a national party. I approached the government and the police but no action was taken. There is a need to have an enforcement mechanism,” Mr. Pathania said.
He demanded a dedicated Media Monitoring Cell in the DIPR for real-time tracking of fake news.
In a reply to MLA Pathania’s questions, the J&K Government said it has proposed a regulatory framework for new and social media in the draft New Media Policy-2026, “which is currently at the inter-departmental consultation stage for finalisation”.
“All departments have designated nodal officers to monitor department-specific fake news, who have been provided login IDs to upload rebuttals on a dedicated portal,” the J&K Government said.
The legal framework governing social media platforms is primarily anchored in the Information Technology Act, 2000, particularly Section 69A which empowers the blocking of content in the interest of public order and national security, complemented by the IT (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, the government said.

Rajasthan Health Minister Gajendra Singh Khimsar’s adverse remarks on the Right to Health Act in the State Assembly on Thursday (February 12, 2026) sparked a controversy and led to a ruckus in the House. Health rights groups and veteran Congress leader Ashok Gehlot also condemned the Minister’s statement.
The Right to Health Act was legislated in 2023 before the previous Congress government’s term ended, making Rajasthan the first State to give a statutory status to health care as a right. The rules under the Act could not be framed because of the imposition of the model code of conduct ahead of the Assembly election.
Speaking during the Question Hour, Mr. Khimsar said the then Congress regime had enacted the law ahead of polls to “draw political mileage” and added that Ayushman Bharat and the Chief Minister’s Ayushman Aarogya Yojana were operative in the State to cater to all needs of medical care for the patients.
“What is the need for a law on the right to health?” Mr. Khimsar asked, leading to objection by the Opposition Congress MLAs, who raised slogans and trooped to the well of the House. Amid the stormy scenes, Congress members staged a walkout in protest against the dissatisfactory reply by the Minister and the hints of scrapping the legislation.
The issue figured in the Question Hour when Congress MLA from Bundi, Harimohan Sharma, wanted to know the progress in framing of rules under the Act and the related aspects. Leader of Opposition Tika Ram Jully asked why the rules were not being framed and whether the State government wanted to implement the law.
As the matter was not resolved amid pandemonium in the House and the next question on the list was called, the issue spilt out of the Assembly. Former Chief Minister Gehlot condemned Mr. Khimsar’s remarks and accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government of surrendering before the private medical lobby.
“The Minister’s statement that there is no need for the right to health amounts to rubbing salt on the wounds of the poor and middle-class patients troubled by rising medical expenses,” Mr. Gehlot said in a post on X. He said the BJP government, which had failed to frame the rules, was now resorting to excuses.
The Jan Swasthya Abhiyan (JSA)-Rajasthan demanded that Mr. Khimsar publicly acknowledge the “full scope and intent” of the Right to Health Act and immediately frame and notify the rules required to operationalise the law. The health rights group also asked the Minister to withdraw his statement made in the Assembly.
JSA coordinator Chhaya Pachauli said the State government should fulfil its statutory obligation, as the Act had remained largely unimplemented for three years in the absence of necessary rules. “The institutional mechanism mandated under the legislation should be strengthened, rather than weakened through misleading public statements,” Ms. Pachauli said.
The Act gives every resident of the State the right to emergency treatment care “without prepayment of requisite fee or charges” by any public health institution, health care establishment and designated health care centre. The Congress had made a promise to legislate the right to health in its manifesto for the 2018 Assembly election.
The legislation makes it mandatory for the hospitals to provide treatment in emergency cases without waiting for medico-legal formalities and give medicines and transport facilities without charging money. The Act’s implementation could do away with out-of-pocket expenditure and bring transparency and accountability within the healthcare system.

In an important judgment in connection with Ratna Bhandar, the treasury of Shree Jagannath Temple, Puri, the Orissa High Court has directed the State Government to complete the exercise of tallying the fresh inventory report with the inventory report of the Committee submitted in the year 1978 within the next three months.
During the past many years, the issue of the ruinous condition of Ratna Bhandar and the missing of its keys had been raised in different forums.
As per the last inventory carried out 45 years ago, the Ratna Bhandar had more than 1.2 quintals of gold and 2.2 quintals of silver. In addition to this, there is a sizeable amount of gold ornaments which are in regular use in the temple. For obvious reasons, the State Government had shown ‘reluctance’ to open the treasury of Shree Jagannath Temple.
After the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power, the State constituted a High Level Committee under the Chairmanship of Justice Biswanath Rath, former Orissa High Court Judge. Subsequently, the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) was framed by the government in relation to the opening of the Ratna Bhandar. They were opened on July 14, 2024.
The jewellery and valuables of both the Ratna Bhandars were shifted to temporary strong rooms located in the adjacent Jagamohana in order to facilitate the Archaeological Survey of India to conduct the repair and conservation works of the Ratna Bhandar.
Adjudicating a matter relating to delay in tallying, a division bench of Orissa High Court comprising Chief Justice Harish Tandon and Judge Justice M.S. Raman directed, “we hasten to add that no complacency can be shown by the State Government in relation to the process of the inventory and the report submitted by the Committee and we trust and hope that the State shall show alacrity in this regard.”
“We further direct the State government to complete the exercise of tallying the inventory report submitted by the newly constituted Committee with the inventory report of the Committee submitted in the year 1978 within three months from date,” says the Division Bench, which had delivered judgment on January 27, 2026. The copy of judgment was made public recently.
The Court observed that “it is no gain saying that the inventory of the jewellery and valuables of Lord Shri Jagannath which was conducted way back in the year 1978 shall be the benchmark document in order to ascertain the inventory undertaken by the committee subsequently constituted by the State Government, whether all the jewellery and valuables of Lord Shri Jagannath which were found at the time of the inventory conducted in the year 1978 tally with the inventory done by the present committee.”
Moreover, the High Court directed that the report of the Inquiry Committee with regard to the missing key should be placed on the floor of Assembly House in the ensuing session. “We expect that a decision would be taken thereupon,” judges remarked.
“The inquiry committee also submitted the report on the missing or misplacement of the keys of those Ratna Bhandars, which, in terms of the provisions of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 is required to be placed on the floor of the House of the Assembly. There cannot be any dormant exercise in this regard and it is an ordained duty of the State to take prompt action,” the High Court observed.
Meanwhile, the repair and conservation work of both the Ratna Bhandars has already been completed by the Archaeological Survey of India.

Sharing data on the MoUs signed in Tamil Nadu since mid-2021, Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on Thursday said 73.53% of the 1,179 agreements had been converted into actual projects.
“This data is for those who have been questioning us over the conversion of MoUs,” the Chief Minister said, speaking at the Conversion Conclave 2026 in Chennai.
In an elaborate presentation on the subject, Industries Minister T.R.B. Rajaa said a total of 1,179 MoUs, entailing a cumulative investment of ₹12.37 lakh crore and the creation of 36.52 lakh jobs, were signed in the past five years. Of them, 867 projects were in advanced stages of implementation, he added. “The conversion rate is 73.53%, while 35.11% are operational,” he said, contending that no other State had the courage or the capability to hold a conclave to prove how MoUs were being converted into investments.
“We ensured distributed growth across all districts in Tamil Nadu. The focus was not on investment numbers; it was on the number of jobs, the quality of the jobs, and the location of the jobs. According to EPFO data, 29.63 lakh jobs have been created over the past four years. I am trying to give the facts from our side, and I’m also backing them up with data from the Union government,’ Mr. Rajaa said.
According to the Minister, 18 investment conclaves were held across Tamil Nadu, and in countries including the U.S., Dubai, and the UAE. A total of 1,130 MoUs were signed at these conclaves, with a committed investment of ₹10.43 lakh crore and a committed employment for 33.30 lakh people, he said. With regard to the foreign conclaves, the conversion rate stood at 69.56%, with 26.08% already operational, while 48 of the 69 MoUs signed were at an advanced stage of implementation, he added.
Stating that the Dravidian model of governance focuses on distributed growth, the Minister added, “We have ensured distributed growth – the northern region has grown by 41%, and the southern region by 36%.”
“In the central and western regions, land availability is tough, but we will bring more investors here,” he said.
Mr. Rajaa also showed a chart highlighting the economic impact of the investments. He said the State had achieved 11.19% GSDP growth in the financial year 2025, and 36% growth in per capita income in four years. The four-year average in manufacturing stood at 9.38%, $52.07 billion (2x growth in exports in a year), 36% growth in electronics exports in five years and 14.74% manufacturing growth in one year.
Two fresh MoUs were signed at the conclave. One was with Bharat Biotech for bio-similars manufacturing in Kancheepuram, entailing investments to the tune of ₹5,000 crore. An MoU was also signed with Hyundai Motors India Foundation for setting up a skill development centre for training 7,000 students in futuristic skills in Kancheepuram. The ground-breaking ceremony was held for over 70 companies.
Dabur India Ltd, the world’s largest ayurveda company, held the ground-breaking ceremony for its new, world-class FMCG manufacturing facility at Tindivanam. This is Dabur’s first manufacturing plant in south India.

Krishna Byre Gowda
As the government is gearing up to provide digital title deeds for properties of over 1.1 lakh families in unrecognised habitations in Karnataka, on February 14 in Haveri, it is set to create a record of sorts.
“We have already provided digital title deeds to over 1.1 lakh families in unrecognised habitations of the State last year and are set to provide certificates to another 1.1 lakh families now to mark completion of 1,000 days of our governance. Providing title deeds to 2.2 lakh families in unrecognised habitations in two years is a record. Also this is one of the largest numbers in the country,” Revenue Minister Krishna Byre Gowda told The Hindu.
An estimated 10 to 12 lakh people are expected to benefit in the last two years owing to these measures.
Possession certificates had been given to 1.08 lakh such families by the erstwhile BJP government. However, they were not the digital ones.
“These digital title deeds cannot be tampered with or lost. Under this drive, the government officials themselves have gone to the doorsteps of beneficiaries to identify them without asking them to apply for title deeds,” he said.
“We are registering these title deeds with sub-registrars through absolute deeds. The beneficiaries will have to pay only the scanning charges. In addition to this, the beneficiaries will also get e-swathu – creation of a title in the panchayat records in their name. This is the absolute completion of their ownership process,” the Minister maintained.
“These are habitations that existed for 30 to 100 years, but never had recognition of a village. They do not exist on any government record. Since they are not part of official records, it was not possible as per norms to provide them any public infrastructure like hospitals and schools or civic amenities. However, on humanitarian grounds, such facilities were being given in the last decade by violating the norms,” the Minister explained.
The State had 6,500 unrecognised habitations when the Karnataka Land Revenue Act, 1964, was amended to declare them as revenue villages in 2016. Of them, 1,557 were declared as revenue villages till May, 2023. In the last two-and-a-half years, another 3,000 habitations have been given recognition. Similar measures are in the pipeline for another 1,300 habitations, the Minister noted.

--------------------
Pointing out that public properties controlled by various municipalities are not maintained and protected as mandated by law, the High Court of Karnataka directed the State government to set up and operationalise a Municipal Trust Property Management System (MTPMS), as a single source of truth for all such properties across the State and assign a Trust Property Identification Number (TPIN).
Besides, the court directed that all municipalities under the Karnataka Municipalities (KMC) Act, 1964, will have to identify and prepare a comprehensive inventories of all “municipal properties” as defined under Section 81 of the KMC Act by correlating municipal and revenue records, land grant orders, and town planning documents within 90 days. The MTPMS should be integrated with other land related systems like Bhoomi, Mojini, e-municipalities, and Sakala portal, etc., the court said.
Stating that all identified “municipal properties” will have to be classified, risk-graded, physically demarcated on the ground, and geo-tagged using GIS technology, the court said revenue records, including Records of Rights, Tenancy and Crop (RTCs) and municipal records should clearly reflect classification as Municipal Trust Property and no alteration should be made without issuance of notice, conduct of enquiry and passing orders as per the law.
Justice Suraj Govindaraj issued the direction while disposing of a petition filed by Syed Matin Abbas against the Mysuru Deputy Commissioner’s (DC) 2017 order of cancelling khata of property that his father had purchased in auction conducted by Town Municipal Council, Periyapatna, in 1977.
No “municipal property” coming under Section 81 of the Act, should be sold, leased, or otherwise alienated except in strict compliance with Section 72(2) of the Act, and with express Government approval, wherever such approval is required, as “municipal properties vest in the municipalities only in a fiduciary capacity as “trustee” and not as “absolute owner”, the court made it clear.
While directing the government to set up two committees at the State and the district levels, the court has tasked the district level committees, to be headed by the respective DCs, to conduct time-bound audit of past sales, leases, grant, or transfers, encroachments or unauthorised constructions, and impermissible change of land use.
Stating that a public digital portal should be maintained displaying municipality-wise properties, and providing mechanisms for citizens to report encroachments or misuse of “municipal properties”, the court said that responsibility should be fixed on officers found to have facilitated illegal alienation, encroachment, or misuse of “municipal properties” and disciplinary or other action should be initiated against them as per law.
Court’s directions
Prepare comprehensive inventory of ‘municipal properties’ across the State
Create Municipal Trust Property Management System to manage all of them.
Assign Trust Property Identification Number to every ‘municipal properties’
Identify municipal properties with geo-tagging using GIS tech
Time-bound audits of past sales, leases, encroachments, and land use changes
Provide a public portal for citizen to report misuse of ‘municipal property’

After much deliberations over cricket matches to be played at M. Chinnaswamy Stadium here, the Karnataka government on Thursday agreed to allow the Indian Premier League (IPL) matches at the stadium with certain conditions.
Ending speculation about the home ground of the defending champions Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) hosting matches, the government cleared the way for the matches even as it will spell out conditions over the next couple of days.
It is speculated that spectators to be allowed against the capacity of the stadium could be brought down to have better crowd management and apply safety conditions.
As per convention, the defending champions will host the inaugural match of the IPL season as well as Qualifier 2 and finals. With decks cleared, it is expected that RCB, the reigning champions, will start off the IPL 2026 in Bengaluru. Incidentally, Bengaluru was host to the 2016 IPL final — before the convention was adopted — but lost the match to Sunrisers Hyderabad.
The State government banned cricket matches at the Chinnaswamy Stadium after 11 persons died in the stampede as the crowd surged into the stadium on June 4 when the winning RCB team was celebrating its maiden IPL victory inside the stadium.
Following the fiasco, the State government, which came under intense scrutiny by the Karnataka High Court, and was embarrassed in public, banned sporting activity with spectators until safety measures were put in place.
The retired judge Micheal Cunha who probed the matter listed 17 recommendations to make the stadium safe for spectators. While pressure was on the State government to allow matches to be played, the government asked GBA Commissioner Maheshwar Rao to scrutinise the compliance to the Cunha committee recommendation.
On Thursday, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister H.K. Patil, when asked about the level of compliance by the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) in making the stadium safe for spectators, said that the Home Minister would be revealing the details.
“The Home Department will issue special order revealing conditions and preparedness needed. The government took note of the Cunha Committee report and the report of expert committee, headed by Maheshwar Rao, following which the decision was taken.”

The Ernakulam Rural police busted an eight-member gang of migrants accused of cheating a senior citizen of lakhs of rupees by convincing him that he had won many prizes and gift vouchers while buying a car.
The Nedumbassery police caught the accused from Edathala. Among the accused, four are from Delhi, three from Uttar Pradesh, and one from West Bengal.
The 61-year-old man from Kadungalloor was allegedly duped by the gang by convincing him that he had won special discount packages for family trips to European countries along with gift vouchers. The gang contacted him over the phone and demanded ₹6.01 lakh, claiming that it was required to avail the “bumper offer”.
They reportedly told him to pay ₹3 lakh in advance, assuring that further discounts would be available if he did so. Based on this, the victim paid ₹1.50 lakh. A meeting in this connection was held at a hotel in Nedumbassery. The victim lodged a police complaint after the ‘bumper offer’ was not forthcoming even after making the payment.
The investigation team included Inspector R. Rajesh, sub-inspectors S.S. Sreelal and Anoop T., and senior civil police officer V.P. Jinto.

Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi on Thursday (February 12, 2026) said the government could file cases or move a Privilege Motion against him, but he would continue to stand with farmers, as he accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of being “anti-farmer” and of “selling” the country through the India-U.S. interim trade deal.
“I stand with the farmers and won’t back an inch,” Mr. Gandhi said in a video that he posted on his X handle.
Earlier in the day, Opposition leaders including Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge protested within the Parliament complex against the trade deal as well as expressed solidarity with the general strike called by labour unions and farmers’ association.
MPs from Samajwadi Party, DMK and Left parties also took part in the protest outside Makar Dwar of Parliament.
In a video statement posted online, Mr. Gandhi launched a sharp attack on the government over the agreement, alleging that there was a “chokehold” on the Prime Minister and that his “reins” were in the hands of U.S. President Donald Trump.
FIR हो,मुकदमा दर्ज हो या Privilege प्रस्ताव लाएं - मैं किसानों के लिए लड़ूंगा।जो भी ट्रेड डील किसानों की रोज़ी-रोटी छीने या देश की खाद्य सुरक्षा को कमजोर करे, वह किसान-विरोधी है।अन्नदाताओं के हितों से किसान-विरोधी मोदी सरकार को समझौता नहीं करने देंगे। pic.twitter.com/gNVMEYFp3i
“FIR is filed, a case is registered, or a Privilege Motion is brought — I will fight for the farmers,” he said in an X post in Hindi along with the video, adding: “Any trade deal that takes away the farmers’ livelihood or weakens the country’s food security is anti-farmer. We will not let the anti-farmer Modi government compromise on the interests of the food providers.”
In the video, Mr. Gandhi said farmers were the foundation of the country.
“The Congress fought for food security and Narendra Modi has betrayed our food security and our farmers. By striking a deal with the U.S., he has sold cotton, soybean, apple and fruit farmers. For years, foreigners have been trying to capture our agriculture market,” he said, adding that Mr. Modi had opened the doors for them.
“This is the truth, he (Modi) also knows this. He has done this as there is a chokehold on his neck. Narendra Modi’s reins are in the hands of Donald Trump,” he claimed.
Mr. Gandhi claimed that “maize, cotton, soybean and fruit farmers are only the beginning” and alleged that the Prime Minister would open the entire agriculture market to “friends like Adani, Ambani and foreign powers.”
He also criticised the differences prevailing between Indian and American farming systems. “American farmers have farmlands that are in acres, it is all mechanised and the government gives them subsidy. On the other hand, the farms owned by our farmers are small, they don’t get MSP and there is no mechanisation,” he said.
“Put cases against me, abuse me, do whatever you want, file a Privilege Motion, it does not matter to me… Do whatever you want, I am standing with the farmers. I will not budge even an inch,” Mr. Gandhi said doubling down on his stance.
“Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge ji, me, and the whole Congress are standing with the farmers. We will not let this injustice happen,” he added.
Mr. Gandhi alleged that the agreement, which he said involved removing “non-tariff barriers” on American agricultural products, posed a direct threat to India’s food security and farmers’ livelihoods. He said small farmers would not be able to compete with subsidised and mechanised American agriculture.
“We will fight from the streets to Parliament, in every village, on every platform — protecting India’s farmers and the nation’s food security,” he said.
At a meeting of Lok Sabha MPs of the Congress in the evening, Mr. Gandhi lauded his colleagues for dominating the first part of the Budget session, taking on the government on  a “sell out” trade deal and urged them to take the message to the people.

The Congress on Thursday (February 12, 2026) demanded the resignation of Union Petroleum Minister Hardeep Puri after his name came up in the Epstein Files.
Responding to Mr. Puri’s explanation that he was in touch with the late Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier who was charged with serious sex offences, as part of his “professional exchanges,” Congress leader Pawan Khera asked why he organised a visit for LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman when there was a full-fledged Indian Embassy.
“Hardeep Puri at that time was a retired diplomat. In what capacity was he organising Hoffman’s India visit?” Mr. Khera asked in a video that he posted on his X handle.
“Had the Indian embassy closed down? Was the Indian Ambassador not there? Wasn’t Sushma Swaraj the External Affairs Minister? Why did Narendra Modi need the services of Hardeep Puri? And why did Narendra Modi need Epstein for Reid Hoffman’s visit?” the Congress leader added.
The Congress party has stepped up its attack on the Union Petroleum Minister after his name appeared in some of the mails pertaining to the Epstein Files.
Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi has raised the issue inside and outside Parliament, even though his exact comments were removed from the Lok Sabha records.
While the ruling alliance said it would bring a privilege motion against Mr. Gandhi for making “unsubstantiated allegations” against Mr. Puri, the Petroleum Minister defended his mail exchanges with Epstein as “professional.”
“What happens in New York does not stay in New York,” Mr. Khera said on X, adding, “@HardeepSPuri must resign now!”

The Karnataka Cabinet on Thursday approved the distribution of smart cards to beneficiaries of the State’s flagship Shakti Scheme, nearly two-and-a-half years after the scheme was launched.
Speaking to The Hindu, Transport Minister Ramalinga Reddy said that the cards will be distributed free of cost to beneficiaries. “We are planning to distribute through the Seva Sindhu portal or through Bangalore One and Karnataka One centres upon registration. However, the rollout may take some time as the cards have to be manufactured,” Mr. Reddy said.
“The smart card will help the government accurately record the actual number of passengers who have travelled and enable the generation of reliable data,” Mr. Reddy added.
Introduced on June 11, 2023, as the first of the Congress government’s five guarantees, the Shakti scheme allows women, including transgender persons and students, to travel free of cost on non-premium State-run buses. The scheme has since emerged as one of the most popular welfare initiatives in the State and even earned a place in the Golden Book of World Records for ferrying the highest number of women passengers under a free-travel programme.
According to official data as of February 10, 2026, as many as 666,92,61,660 women passengers have travelled under the scheme across Karnataka. The total ticket value of women passengers travelled stands at ₹17,271,11,35,254.
Despite its success, the smart card system, envisioned to streamline ticketing and improve data collection, had remained in the pipeline.
At present, women passengers can avail themselves of a ‘zero ticket’ by showing any valid government-issued identity card to conductors. However, officials said there were instances where a few passengers produced identity cards that were “not valid or duplicate” to claim zero tickets. The scheme is meant exclusively for women domiciled in Karnataka.
An official said that the smart card was very much necessary for the conductors also as there were cases where few conductors were also issuing zero tickets without any person travelling to show or to increase the number of passengers leading to incorrect data.
Official added, “Manually verifying identity cards in crowded buses often delays conductors’ work. With smart cards, conductors can generate tickets quickly by either visually verifying the card or tapping it on the Electronic Ticketing Machine (ETM), eliminating delays caused by checking identity documents”.

The Supreme Court on Thursday (February 12, 2026) asked the Centre if climate activist Sonam Wangchuk was able to see, on his part, four videos the authorities are citing, among other clips, to justify his detention under the National Security Act (NSA).
Appearing before a Bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and P.B. Varale, Additional Solicitor General K.M. Nataraj said the authorities banked on 23 videos to order detention, and everything was supplied to Mr. Wangchuk.
However, the activist’s lawyers maintained four videos were not in the pen drive given to Mr. Wangchuk and that he has repeatedly sought the videos from the authorities.
During the hearing, Mr. Nataraj submitted that the detention had prevented the violence from escalating in a sensitive border area.
On February 11, the court had pointed to phrases in statements made by Mr. Wangchuk expressing his anxiety about departing from the Gandhian, non-violent mode of struggle. The Centre had strongly objected to the court associating Mr. Wangchuk, whom the government counsel described as a person “completely anti-India”, with Mahatma Gandhi.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and Mr. Nataraj had disagreed with the court’s earlier proposal to relook the detention order on medical grounds. Mr. Mehta said Mr. Wangchuk’s “health facade was manufactured and synthetic”.
The activist has been detained in Jodhpur Central Jail for nearly five months since September 26 last year, two days after violent protests demanding Statehood and Sixth Schedule status for Ladakh left four people dead and several injured in the Union Territory.

The United Democratic Front (UDF) will take steps to boost Kerala’s economy if it is voted to power in the Assembly elections, Opposition leader V.D. Satheesan has said.
He was addressing a public event at the Muthalakkulam Ground here on Thursday night as part of the UDF’s ‘Puthuyuga Yathra’ campaign.
Accusing the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government of pushing people into a debt trap, Mr. Satheesan said the UDF would streamline tax administration and plug leakage from the exchequer. Government funds would be utilised to help the poor, he said. Mr. Satheesan claimed that the UDF had an alternative vision for the development of the State.
Meanwhile, the Congress leader accused the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] of pursuing a communal line. He alleged that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan was resorting to majority communalism as his efforts to “appease” minorities in the Lok Sabha polls miserably failed. He was followed by senior CPI(M) leaders such as A.K. Balan and Minister for Culture Saji Cherian, who came up with condemnable communal statements. Mr. Satheesan said that no communal elements would be allowed to thrive in Kerala.
Saluting the UDF workers who turned up for the event despite the trade union strike held on the day, he said the front would stage a miraculous victory in the next Assembly election in Kozhikode district.
Senior Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala, who opened the event, said the LDF government would crumble in the coming days. K. Praveenkumar, Kozhikode District Congress Committee president, P.K. Kunhalikutty, Indian Union Muslim League national general secretary, and M.K. Raghavan, Kozhikode MP, said the UDF would win a majority of Assembly seats in the upcoming elections in Kozhikode.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will on Friday (February 13, 2026) inaugurate the new Prime Minister’s Office ‘Seva Teerth’, and the Central Secretariat buildings, Kartavya Bhavan 1 and 2. The PM will also preside over the last meeting of the Union Cabinet at the South Block.
An era will end when the iconic North and South Blocks are vacated.
The North and South Blocks initially housed the British government, and were taken over by the government of independent India in 1947. They were designed by Herbert Baker, a contemporary of Edwin Lutyens, the architect of ‘Lutyen’s Delhi’.
The South Block houses the Prime Minister’s Office, as well as the offices of the Union Ministries of External Affairs and Defence. The North Block houses the Ministries of Home Affairs, and Finance.
The Prime Minister’s Office will be moved on Friday (February 13, 2026) to the newly built ‘Seva Teerth’ complex.
‘Seva Teerth’ will also house the National Security Council Secretariat and the Cabinet Secretariat, all of which were previously situated across different locations.
Kartavya Bhavan 1 and 2 house several key Ministries, including the Ministries of Finance, Defence, Health and Family Welfare, Education, Corporate Affairs, Culture, Law and Justice, Information and Broadcasting, Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Chemicals and Fertilizers, and Tribal Affairs.
Both building complexes feature digitally integrated offices, structured public interface zones, and centralised reception facilities. Designed in accordance with 4-Star GRIHA standards, the complexes incorporate renewable energy systems, water conservation measures, waste management solutions, and high-performance building envelopes.
“The inauguration marks a transformative milestone in India’s administrative governance architecture and reflects the Prime Minister’s commitment to building a modern, efficient, accessible and citizen-centric governance ecosystem,” an official statement said here.
“For decades, several key government offices and Ministries functioned from fragmented and ageing infrastructure spread across multiple locations in the Central Vista area. This dispersion led to operational inefficiencies, coordination challenges, escalating maintenance costs and sub-optimal working environments. The new building complexes address these issues by consolidating administrative functions within modern, future-ready facilities,” it said.
The new complexes also feature comprehensive safety and security frameworks, including smart access control systems, surveillance networks, and advanced emergency response infrastructure, ensuring a secure and accessible environment for officials and visitors.

Naysayers who claim the Indian economy is dead are mocking at the people of India, who are contributing to India’s growth, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said here on Thursday while replying to the debate on the general Budget in Rajya Sabha. She said growth without inflation is an achievement of the entire country. “That is, you are having a good, high rate of growth of the GDP, and there is a low inflation, which is being held at that kind of a level continuously,” she said.
Apparently referring to a recent statement of Opposition Leader in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi that the country’seconomy is dead, she said there is no way anyone can decry saying, “Oh no, but this economy is probably dead. “This economy is not really doing well. These kinds of nay-sayers are only mocking at the people of India, who are really doing their bit to contribute to India’s growth,” the Finance Minister added.
She said high growth and low inflation is a unique balance in the economy and it was not a rare coincidence as the Union Government undertook tremendous efforts, detailed planning and timely action to achieve this milestone. “This gives us the confidence for planning for next two decades,” she said.
She countered the charges that middle class is being suppressed to achieve high tax collection. “There is no evidence of middle-class suppression. Actually, there is enough and more evidence of historic middle-class expansion and formalisation driven by the economic reforms that have been undertaken in the last ten years. High personal income tax collection is not necessarily the middle class being crushed,” she said.
The Finance Minister said there are more people with taxable income and more income is visible in the formal sector. “So, the economy is no longer narrow, and it’s not just confined to the elite. The middle-class basket is widening. Between 2013-14 and 2024-25, the number of taxpayers, that is, people filing returns or TDS deducted, rose from 5.26 crore to 12.13 crore,” she said claiming the largest structural expansion of the middle class in this country. “People are coming on board to pay, and coming on board to pay not because we are bringing more rates,” she said.
She said inflation is also at a historical low. “So, somewhere middle class suppressed cannot coexist with real incomes rising and with record low inflation. And there is an upward mobility of the workforce as well,” she said.

--------------------
In a major relief to rail commuters, Union Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has promised to consider the demand to grant stops for various trains, including the newly introduced special MEMU service from Kollam, at various railway stations between Chingavanam and Ernakulam, according to K. Francis George, MP from Kottayam.
The assurance was given during a meeting in which the MP directly discussed various railway-related issues with the Railway Minister.
While the new MEMU has been allotted stops at all halt stations between Kollam and Changanassery, the exclusion of stations such as Chingavanam, Kuruppanthara, Kaduthuruthy, Kanjiramattom and Chottanikkara amounts to serious discrimination, the MP informed the Minister.
The MP also pointed out that the newly introduced train is currently operating with insufficient compartments, resulting in severe overcrowding. Passengers are forced to travel in extremely congested conditions, with hardly any standing space. The MP also requested that necessary steps be taken to ensure service on all days of the week.
Pointing out that the Kottayam railway station is equipped with all essential basic facilities and has six platforms,  Mr. George also urged the Minister for new trains originating from Kottayam and that services currently terminating at Ernakulam be extended to Kottayam.
Mr. George also demanded additional stops at stations within the constituency, inclding stops for the Ernakulam–Kayamkulam MEMU passenger at Ettumanur, Kuruppanthara, Vaikom Road, and Mulanthuruthy; for the Venad Express at Vaikom Road; for the Vanchinad and Malabar Express trains at Ettumanur; and for the Velankanni Express at Kuruppanthara.
The Railway Minister has also assured that the remaining construction works of the second entrance at the Kottayam railway station will be completed within a month and opened to the public, the MP said.

The Government of Andhra Pradesh has launched ‘Happy Sunday’, a community-led urban happiness and neighbourhood engagement movement, across all Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) in the State, aiming to promote citizen participation and strengthen neighbourhood bonds.
Orders were issued through G.O. Rt. No. 157 of the Municipal Administration & Urban Development (MA&UD) Department on February 12, 2026.
The initiative seeks to enhance emotional well-being, encourage physically active lifestyles, and foster social cohesion by activating public spaces such as streets and parks for community interaction.
Resident Welfare Associations, apartment associations and local community groups will lead the voluntary, non-commercial activities, while ULBs will act only as facilitators by providing permissions, basic logistical support and safety coordination.
Programmes will generally be organised on the second and fourth Sundays of every month for two to three hours during early mornings. Activities may include wellness sessions, sports, cultural events, environmental drives and learning circles, ensuring inclusive participation across age groups.
Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu said the initiative aligns with the vision of building people-first cities that strengthen social relationships alongside infrastructure.
MA&UD Principal Secretary S. Suresh Kumar, in a press release, emphasised that the movement depended on active community leadership. Minister for MA&UD Ponguru Narayana described it as a new chapter in participatory urban governance.
The programme will commence State-wide from February 22, 2026.

Playing loud music on an aeroplane without earphones may lead to penal action if such actions lead to unruly behaviour under aviation rules. Replying to a question raised in the Lok Sabha by Namakkal MP Matheshwaran, Minister of State for Civil Aviation Murlidhar Mohol said the action will be taken as per the Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR) issued by the DGCA.
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) issued CAR to deal with unruly passengers.
Without indicating any new penal provisions for people playing loud music on the aircraft, the minister clarified that the airlines provide in-flight entertainment and play soft instrumental music during boarding and disembarkation.
He further highlighted Rules 22, 23, and 29 of the Aircraft Rules of 1937 that cover disruptive behaviour on board an aircraft.
Rule 22 deals with refusal of carriage and disembarkation of passengers, Rule 23 empowers the pilot-in-command to restrain persons acting in a manner prejudicial to safety or good order, and Rule 29 provides for penalties for contravention of the Aircraft Rules.
The minister also responded to a query related to vlogging inside an aeroplane and underscored Rule 13 of the Aircraft Rules which restricts photography at DGCA-licensed aerodromes.

TITLE: The Big Rafale Deal: How G2G Model Fast-Tracks India’s Largest Defence Acquisition
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/the-big-rafale-deal-how-g2g-model-fast-tracks-indias-largest-defence-acquisition-ws-l-9898206.html
--------------------
India has finalised one of its most significant defence acquisitions ever — a proposed Rs 3.25 lakh crore agreement with France to procure 114 additional Dassault Rafale fighter jets for the Indian Air Force (IAF). The deal, cleared by the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) ahead of French President Emmanuel Macron’s visit to New Delhi next week, will dramatically expand India’s air combat strength and transform its aerospace industrial base.
For Indian pilots and planners, this procurement represents a pivotal leap in capability. The Rafale, a 4.5-generation multi-role fighter with integrated electronic warfare systems, advanced sensors, and precision weapons, has already proven itself in demanding operational conditions. Its deployment in recent missions and drills has reinforced confidence in its performance.
A key feature of the deal is the use of a direct Government-to-Government (G2G) framework between New Delhi and Paris — a model similar to the earlier Rafale acquisition a decade ago, which is seen within defence circles as faster, cleaner and more predictable than traditional multi-vendor tenders. This approach is expected to significantly cut procedural delays that often slow down large defence procurements.
The G2G framework bypasses much of the bureaucratic layering. Instead of negotiating with multiple vendors, India negotiates directly with the French government, which then guarantees delivery through Dassault Aviation. This dramatically cuts procedural timelines and reduces the risk of future cancellations.
The supplying government, meanwhile, effectively stands behind the contract. This offers clearer pricing structures, state-backed performance guarantees, and better accountability on timelines
Under the current proposal, 18 Rafales would be delivered from France, while the remaining 96 are slated for final assembly and manufacture in India. Officials have stressed that this arrangement will not only enhance India’s combat fleet but also catalyse skilled jobs, robust supply chains, and long-term growth of the domestic aerospace sector.
Crucially, the deal is designed to integrate Indian weapons systems into the Rafale platform, ensuring that indigenous technologies and armaments work seamlessly with the new jets — a requirement New Delhi has underscored during negotiations.
The pact also envisages substantial technology transfer from Dassault Aviation and its partners to Indian firms participating in production and support. Tata Advanced Systems, for example, has already signed production transfer agreements with Dassault to manufacture key structural parts — the first time such components will be made outside France — marking a milestone under the “Make in India" initiative.
Indian defence planners see this acquisition as a force multiplier, bridging capability gaps while indigenous fighters such as HAL Tejas and future platforms like the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) mature. Once concluded and fully implemented, the deal will turn the Rafale from an imported asset into a partly Indian-made cornerstone of India’s combat aviation fleet.

Therefore, this budget includes various components from 2026 to 2050. We are also starting the new five-year cycle of new finance commission. The budget is largely based on the recommendations of the commission," Sitharaman said.
She also outlined various government initiatives, including skilling and infrastructure investment. The Budget 2026 has increased public capex from Rs 11.2 lakh crore in BE 2025-26 to Rs 12.2 lakh crore in FY2026-27, she said.
“We have said that instead of waiting to qualify and finishing your education and coming out and seeking where should they go for acquiring skills, the skilling element can be brought into education itself and at the end of the day when they come out, students can say I can become an entrepreneur and this kind of a mega centre can be kept next to any industrial cluster that any state has," she said.
Lok Sabha took up discussion on the Union Budget on Wednesday. Sitharaman is expected to reply to the debate in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday.

TITLE: 'Conspiracy, Clearance Bypassed’: FIR In Ex-Army Chief’s Book Leak Puts Focus On Overseas Sales
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/conspiracy-clearance-bypassed-fir-in-ex-army-chiefs-book-leak-puts-focus-on-overseas-sales-ws-l-9898034.html
--------------------
The controversy surrounding the former Army chief’s book has deepened, with sources indicating that the publication was allegedly released without mandatory clearance from the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and first sold on online platforms in Canada, Australia, Germany and the United States.
According to sources, the initial investigation following the registration of a case points to a “well-planned conspiracy". It is learnt that the book was leaked in a coordinated manner, bypassing the MoD’s mandatory clearance process for publications involving serving or former defence personnel.
Investigators have found that copies of the book began circulating on online platforms in Canada, Australia, Germany and the US before surfacing elsewhere. Sales are said to have started in these countries first, raising questions about the publishing and distribution chain.
The Special Cell has registered an FIR under sections pertaining to criminal conspiracy. The scope of the probe has now been expanded internationally, covering the US, Canada, Germany and Australia.
A thorough investigation into the digital trail, publishing network and possible international links is currently underway. Sources said the probe is intensifying, with agencies examining overseas connections and coordination in the alleged leak and distribution of the book.
Delhi Police’s Special Cell questioned members of Penguin India’s team on Thursday, following a notice issued to the publisher over its earlier statement on the book controversy. The questioning lasted for approximately two hours.
The Special Cell had served a notice seeking responses to specific queries and summoned representatives of the publishing house for examination. During the session, the team was reportedly asked around 15 questions.
Sources said some of the queries were answered during the questioning, while the Penguin India team sought additional time to respond to the remaining questions. The Special Cell is now expected to examine and analyse the responses submitted by the publisher.
Amid the row, Penguin Random House India, which holds the publishing rights to Four Stars of Destiny, issued a clarification stating that the book has not been published in any format.
The publisher said that an announced title, a pre-order listing nd a published book are distinct stages, and that a book is considered published only when it is available for purchase across retail channels.
The entire row over the book erupted in Parliament when the Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi referred to the alleged contents of General (Retd.) MM Naravane’s unpublished memoir and displayed what he claimed was a copy of the book in the Lok Sabha.
His remarks triggered strong objections from treasury benches, with BJP leaders questioning how an unpublished manuscript was accessed and cited in the House. The episode led to heated exchanges, walkouts and demands for clarification, bringing the status of the book’s publication and its alleged leak into sharp political focus.

TITLE: PM Modi To Inaugurate Seva Teerth And Kartavya Bhavan 1 And 2 On Feb 13
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/pm-modi-to-inaugurate-seva-teerth-and-kartavya-bhavan-1-and-2-on-feb-13-9898036.html
--------------------
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to inaugurate the Seva Teerth, the new building of the Prime Minister’s Office, and Kartavya Bhawan 1 and 2, on February 13. The inauguration of the new buildings will mark a transformative milestone in India’s administrative governance architecture.
According to a statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office, the structures also reflect PM Modi’s commitment to building a modern, efficient, accessible, and citizen-centric governance ecosystem.
The development came decades after several key government offices and ministries functioned from fragmented and ageing infrastructure spread across multiple locations in the Central Vista area causing operational inefficiencies, coordination challenges.
The old structures, with time, escalated maintenance costs and sub-optimal working environments. The new building complexes address these issues by consolidating administrative functions within modern, future-ready facilities, the statement added.
Seva Teerth houses the Prime Minister’s Office, the National Security Council Secretariat, and the Cabinet Secretariat, all of which were previously located across different locations.
Meanwhile, Kartavya Bhavan 1 and 2 will accommodate law, defence, finance, health, agriculture, and several other key ministries.
It has been learnt that the new building complexes feature digitally integrated offices, structured public interface zones and centralised reception facilities.
The building are designed in accordance with 4-Star GRIHA standards and will focus on incorporating renewable energy systems, water conservation measures, waste management solutions and high-performance building envelopes.
These measures significantly reduce environmental impact while enhancing operational efficiency, the PMO said.
Notably, the building complexes will use comprehensive safety and security frameworks, such as smart access control systems, surveillance networks. It will also accomodate advanced emergency response infrastructure, ensuring a secure and accessible environment for officials and visitors.

TITLE: Bihar ‘Paralysis Village’: Patients In Every Hamlet, Deaths Rise As Public Anger Mounts
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/bihar-paralysis-village-patients-in-every-hamlet-deaths-rise-as-public-anger-mounts-ws-l-9897732.html
--------------------
A shocking health situation has emerged in Korjana village of Bihar’s Begusarai district, where residents claim a rising number of paralysis cases and deaths over the past year. Villagers allege that despite repeated incidents and mounting concern, authorities, from block-level officials to the local MLA, have not taken adequate notice of the situation.
According to locals, the village has witnessed a sharp increase in paralysis cases, particularly in the last six months. Residents say more than five people in nearly every hamlet have been affected, and several families have performed last rites for relatives during this period.
The growing number of cases has led villagers to refer to Korjana as ‘Paralysis Village’.
A team from Local18 visited the village to understand the ground reality. During the visit, residents spoke about sudden illnesses, rising treatment expenses, and what they describe as a lack of timely government intervention, raising serious questions about healthcare monitoring and administrative response in the area.
One of the villagers, Kiran Devi, said her father-in-law suddenly suffered a brain haemorrhage, after which he became paralysed. The family is arranging treatment on their own, but she believes timely government assistance could save his life.
Another villager, Pavitri Devi, who is battling paralysis, explained that her hands and feet gradually stopped functioning. She now travels to Chakva for treatment, as most patients from the village reportedly do. Despite this, lives continue to be lost. Speaking to Local18, she broke down in tears, alleging that officials remain unmoved by their suffering.
Dulari Devi stated that many paralysis cases have emerged in the last six months, yet no government aid has reached the village. Similarly, Badam Devi said she was suddenly struck by paralysis and did not even realise when the illness took hold.
Ranjay Yadav pointed out that having more than five paralysis patients in a single neighbourhood is highly unusual. Amarjeet Kumar Yadav echoed the same concern. Sanju Devi added that people from neighbouring villages now visit Korjana to witness the alarming situation themselves.
A young villager, Dilkhush, said his grandfather’s treatment has already cost the family around Rs 50,000. They sought help from private hospitals in Chakva and Samastipur, yet no government doctor has visited Korjana so far.
Dai Rani, whose mother-in-law died after suffering from paralysis, claimed that most deaths have occurred within the past six months.
During the course of reporting, another villager, Dunia Lal, reportedly died within three days of being paralysed.
Most of the affected individuals are above 40 years of age.
Villagers insist that no health department team has visited the area, nor has any formal investigation been initiated. They question why the Block Medical Officer is unaware of deaths and illnesses that have been occurring for nearly a year.
If a health sub-centre exists in the village, residents ask why no health assessment has been conducted. They also question whether the Block Development Officer (BDO) has fulfilled their responsibilities, or if their role has been limited to sanctioning funeral assistance.
The biggest concern raised by villagers is whether the local MLA has forgotten the community after securing votes.
Frustration has led some residents to bitterly refer to Korjana as both ‘Paralysis Village’ and ‘Funeral Village’. Numerous questions are being directed at officials ranging from the BDO to the MLA, yet answers remain elusive.
Whether the illness is the result of a mysterious disease or administrative negligence remains unclear and requires urgent investigation. Until the truth emerges, fear and mistrust towards the system will continue to grow in Korjana.
The central question remains: has empathy disappeared from governance, or are authorities simply waiting for a major inquiry before taking action?

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on Friday (February 13, 2026) gave a huge surprise bonanza for women crediting a sum of ₹5,000 each into the bank accounts of 1.31 crore beneficiaries of the Kalaignar Magalir Urimai Thogai scheme. While ₹3,000 was for the months of February, March and April (₹1,000 per month), a special summer aid of ₹2,000 has also been credited into their accounts, Mr. Stalin announced.
In a social media post, Mr. Stalin also announced that the monthly rights grant under the Kalaignar Magalir Urimai Thogai scheme would be increased from ₹1,000 to ₹2,000 in the Dravidian 2.0 (when the DMK government if re-elected to power in the ensuing Assembly elections.)
தமிழ்நாட்டு மகளிருக்கு இந்த ஸ்டாலின் தந்த உறுதிமொழிதான் உரிமைத்தொகை. யார் தடை ஏற்படுத்தினாலும் அதிலிருந்து பின்வாங்க மாட்டேன்.தேர்தலைக் காரணம் காட்டி, மூன்று மாதங்களுக்கு உரிமைத்தொகையை முடக்கப் பார்க்கிறார்கள். முந்திக்கொண்டது நமது #DravidianModel அரசு!பிப்ரவரி, மார்ச்,… pic.twitter.com/n7VrMqcrb7
Contending that “some are attempting to prevent the disbursement” of the monthly aid for three months citing the elections, Mr. Stalin said: “But, this Dravidian model government overcame it. This urimai thogai (rights grant) was an assurance made by Stalin to the women of Tamil Nadu. I will not step back whoever brought in obstacles.”
The Chief Minister further expressed confidence that his party would win the election with the support of women. In a recorded video clipping, Mr. Stalin sought to explain the credit of ₹5,000 into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries.
The Kalaignar Magalir Urimai Thogai was launched in September 2023 and 1.13 crore women were disbursed a sum of ₹1,000 each and the programme was since expanded to cover 1.31 crore women across the State, he said. “This is not just a grant but a recognition of the contributions these women make in the society.”
The rights grant helped women look after their day-to-day expenses, family expenses, education expenses of their children, he said. Whileso, a “group in Delhi and another group in Tamil Nadu, who were slaves to the Delhi group”, there was information that a conspiracy was being hatched to stop the disbursement of this grant for three months citing elections, Mr. Stalin said.
“There is information that a few are attempting to move the court...As someone from your family, I am aware as to what hardships you would undergo if the grant is suspended for three months. I can realise the pain you would undergo if the disbursement is suspended especially during summer,” he said.
“How will you manage the monthly expenses? Can you get medicines for those in your family? When children are appearing for exams, can you spend for expenses incurred for their education? I have taken an important decision only after thinking through all these,” Mr. Stalin explained.
“I have issued orders for disbursing a special Magalir Urimai Thogai of ₹5,000, including the monthly grant of ₹1,000 for February, March and April and a special summer aid of ₹2,000 to each of the 1.31 crore women. My request to you all is to be careful is spending this money, since this is for the next three months,” Mr. Stalin said.
Expressing hope that his party would win in the ensuing Assembly elections, with the support of women Mr. Stalin announced: “In Dravidian model of governance, the urimai thogai would be increased to ₹2,000. This is the assurance given by Muthuvel Karunanidhi Stalin, who keeps his word.”
Referring to some who may raise doubts as to how the government would afford to implement the increase in the monthly grant, Mr. Stalin said his government has excelled in many fronts, despite the financial crisis. “So, we will win over any obstacles.”

TITLE: As multilateralism erodes, India must reframe its foreign policy
LINK: https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/as-multilateralism-erodes-india-must-reframe-its-foreign-policy/article70624458.ece

Speaking in the Rajya Sabha, Prime Minister Narendra Modi formally acknowledged the new world order. The hard part is to formulate a new national identity and approach to international relations.
India’s leadership of the Global South at the United Nations General Assembly was the foundation of its long-standing foreign policy of ‘strategic autonomy’. The global rules agreed in the UN established by former colonial powers led by the U.S. served their interests in the post-colonial world. India’s Oxbridge-educated diplomats had unquestioned leadership in the UN negotiating text on principles and rules, successfully diverting pressure on poor countries. Climate negotiations ending in 1992 were left entirely to India by the Global South.
However, China’s rise around 2010, through the creation of alternative funding, economic and security institutions, impacted the intellectual leadership position of India and also changed the UN irreversibly. China heads four principal UN agencies, and its aid volumes exceed those of the West. The U.S., now unable to manage the UN process, has withdrawn from 31 UN institutions.
In 1986, the U.S. launched the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, leading to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995, where developing countries’ interests became more differentiated, and India struggled to secure its interests. In a more equal world, since 2019, the U.S. has rejected the dispute settlement mechanism of the WTO, making it dysfunctional and reverting to unilateral tariffs. China, in contrast, has diversified its exports away from the U.S. and is now the largest trading partner of 120 countries.
The problem India faces is not from the rise of China. While the EU and Canada acknowledge the collapse of the multilateral structures, developing countries are wondering how to revive them. With the potential to become the world’s third-largest economy, India is particularly impacted in the U.S.-dominated world of transactional relationships, even willing to discard NATO.
First, leadership of the Global South gave India outsized influence and now where do you speak for developing countries when international institutions and law have withered away? The U.S. and China are competing for technological dominance, not votes in the UN.
Second, ‘strategic autonomy’ applied to the Cold War when India led the Non-Aligned Movement. It lost relevance after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and gradually became a self-declared identity used to rationalise foreign policy choices. India joined the U.S.-led rejuvenated Quad in 2017 and then chose the Russian S-400 missile system over the U.S. Patriot system in 2018.
The reality is that India gravitated towards the Soviet Union after its 1951 veto prevented discussion of Kashmir in the UN Security Council. Russia remains India’s only long-trusted partner giving cutting-edge military technology, which the U.S. is chipping away at testing India’s resolve to remain a third pole in a multipolar world.
Third, with China’s rise, U.S. analysts began describing India not as strategically autonomous but as a “swing state.” The current U.S. military strategy rejects containment of China.
The major scope of international relations, outside of alliances, was within multilateral institutions which has now returned to asymmetric relations. Reciprocity in tariffs is redefined as “America first”, implying others are in a subordinate relationship. Under the India-U.S. Framework Agreement, India has agreed to double imports, largely industrial products, while the U.S. continues an 18% tariff, unilaterally deciding reductions clearly after further concessions. The EU trade agreement eliminated 70% tariff lines with phased reciprocal reductions.
The real question for India is why it was targeted by the U.S. tariffs and how to grow in a world marked by flux.
The U.S. is determined to prevent the rise of another China and India alone has the potential to overtake the U.S. China exploited multilateral rules to become a fiercely independent global manufacturing power and that opportunity no longer exists. The long-term U.S. policy of keeping India apart from Russia and China has now gained greater force and blunting it will test Indian diplomacy.
India’s comparative advantage lies in its young population; nearly half of Silicon Valley’s workforce traces its roots to India. Building and attracting that talent can develop the capability to become a ‘cyber superpower’, spreading AI across security, manufacturing and services to secure development space.
To achieve this, India needs good economic and technological relations with the U.S., Russia, and China, Free Trade Agreements (FTA), and, importantly foreign policy replacing ‘strategic autonomy’ with ‘Viksit Bharat 2047’.
First, taking a leaf from China and the U.S. in the early 1900s, India should bide its time, maintain a low international profile and develop endogenous capabilities, requiring a diplomatic posture to accelerate the Asian Century and a passive role in all other regions.
Second, India must prioritise trade diplomacy by diversifying exports away from the U.S., even as vulnerabilities remain in bilateral relationships. Now that India is open to industrial imports, the push for FTAs must continue with Asia, soon to have two-thirds of global wealth, and Africa, the fastest-growing continent.
Third, India should create new technological, cyber and space relations with Russia, its steadfast and tested partner, now more an Asian than European power. It should also enable China to invest in infrastructure and partner manufacturing, with safeguards, to take advantage of trade opportunities and accelerate growth.
Fourth, India should treat relations with Pakistan as a foreign policy issue rather than a security challenge. A new water-sharing arrangement incorporating the needs of the Kashmir Valley, revival of the Iran-Pakistan-India Peace Pipeline with Pakistan benefiting from transit fees, and even a trade agreement could create economic incentives.
Lastly, as chair of BRICS, India has an opportunity to articulate its new foreign policy by building consensus on repositioning BRICS as an economic cooperation community, not a political multilateral body. Linking official digital currencies to make cross-border trade, repatriation and tourism payments smoother will be a good first step.

TITLE: MK Stalin's Big Pre-Poll Move: Rs 5,000 Each For 1.3 Crore Women Under Kalaignar Scheme

--------------------
Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin on Friday announced the disbursal of Rs 5,000 to women beneficiaries under the Kalaignar Women’s Rights Scheme, describing it as part of his government’s ongoing commitment to women’s welfare.
In a post on X, Chief Minister Stalin emphasised that the payments, covering February, March, and April, include Rs 3,000 as the standard monthly allocation and an additional Rs 2,000 as a “summer special" bonus. He stated that the funds have already been credited to 1.31 crore women under the scheme.
“This promise given by this Stalin to Tamil Nadu women is the rights allocation. No matter who imposes obstacles, I will not back down from it. Using elections as an excuse, they are trying to stall the rights allocation for three months. What was promised was by our #DravidianModel government! As advance for February, March, April months: ₹3 thousand + as summer special allocation: ₹2 thousand!," he tweeted.
Stalin described the scheme as a hallmark of the Dravidian Model government, asserting that attempts to delay the disbursement by three months, allegedly citing elections as an excuse, would not deter his administration. “No matter who imposes obstacles, I will not back down from it," he wrote, highlighting his commitment to the programme.
The DMK leader also promised that in the proposed Dravidian Model 2.0, the monthly rights allocation would increase from Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,000, reinforcing his focus on expanding financial support to women. He concluded the post with a message of solidarity and electoral confidence, urging women to support the party in the upcoming assembly elections.
The tweet comes ahead of the Tamil Nadu assembly elections scheduled later this year, with Stalin’s government seeking to highlight welfare measures targeted at women as a key campaign plank.

The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) has projected the priority sector credit potential of ₹4.88 lakh crore for 2026-27 in Rajasthan. The State Focus Paper (SFP), revealing the district-wise realistic potential in both physical and financial terms, was launched in Jaipur on Friday (February 13, 2026).
Chief Secretary V. Srinivas highlighted the ₹6.11 lakh crore State Budget outlay while releasing the SFP at the NABARD’s State Credit Seminar. Mr. Srinivas said the NABARD had carried out credit planning with the preparation of SFP for the next financial year to align financial institutions with the State’s development priorities.
Mr. Srinivas asked the banks and other stakeholders to work in unison to achieve the projections made in the SFP. “NABARD has played a significant role in strengthening the cooperative movement through computerisation, training programmes and financial support to cooperatives,” he said.
NABARD Chief General Manager for Rajasthan, R. Ravi Babu, said the priority sector credit potential had been calculated in line with the State government’s vision for ‘Developed Rajasthan-2047’. “The block-wise credit potentials are estimated for different sub-sectors while considering the available infrastructure and the actual ground-level credit flow,” he said.
Within the estimates, agriculture and allied activities were projected at ₹2.24 lakh crore and micro, small and medium enterprises at ₹2.27 lakh crore in an indication of the growth balance emerging between farm and non-farm sectors.
Mr. Babu said the credit potential assessed in the SFP would serve as a benchmark for the preparation of the annual credit plan. A roadmap will also be created for achieving the credit projections, improving last-mile delivery, and promoting inclusion, especially for women farmers and cooperative institutions.
The efforts made by the primary agricultural credit societies (PACS), multi-purpose PACS, district central cooperative banks and farmer producer organisations during 2025-26 were also praised at the seminar.
Among others, Additional Chief Secretary (Industries) Shikhar Agrawal, Additional Chief Secretary (Energy) Ajitabh Sharma, Principal Secretary (Cooperative) Manju Rajpal, and Finance (Budget) Secretary Rajan Vishal were present.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday (February 13, 2026) exuded confidence that the party would send three out of four seats from the Odisha quota to Rajya Sabha next month.
The tenure of four Rajya Sabha members of Odisha is coming to an end on April 2 this year. However, the BJP does not have the requisite numbers in the State Assembly to ensure the election of a third candidate to the Upper House of Parliament.
In the 147-member Odisha Legislative Assembly, the BJP has 79 MLAs, followed by the Biju Janata Dal with 50, the Congress with 14, one member from the CPI(M), and three independents. The BJP currently enjoys the support of all three Independent MLAs.
A candidate requires first-preference votes of 31 MLAs to secure election to the Rajya Sabha. Given the present strength in the Assembly, the BJP and the BJD can comfortably ensure the election of two and one candidates, respectively. It requires political manoeuvring by either BJP or BJD to ensure the election of their candidate.
Vijay Singh Tomar, in-charge of BJP party affairs for Odisha, on Friday (February 13, 2026) told reporters, “we are confident of sending three Rajya Sabha members from Odisha. Party’s Parliamentary Committee will take a call as to who would be their candidates.”
There are 10 Rajya Sabha MPs from Odisha — seven from the BJD and three from the BJP. The tenure of BJD MPs Niranjan Bishi and Muzibulla Khan and BJP MPs Mamata Mohanta and Sujeet Kumar will end on April 2.
It is to be noted that Odisha Pradesh Congress Committee President Bhakta Charan Das had announced to meet former Chief Minister and BJD supremo Naveen Patnaik for a discussion to jointly send a person of eminence to Rajya Sabha.

Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said that there was more yet to emerge from the Epstein-related material, and the truth would come out in due course.

Stepping up their attack on Union Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri, Opposition parties demanded his resignation, alleging that the revelations regarding his interactions with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein had raised serious questions about his conduct.
Members of the INDIA (Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance) bloc on Friday (February 13, 2025) protested outside the main entrance of the Parliament building. They also raised slogans inside the Lok Sabha, forcing an adjournment.
Addressing a press conference at the Congress headquarters, party spokesperson Pawan Khera asked in what capacity and under whose instructions Mr. Puri had met Epstein in the United States between 2014 and 2016, when he had held no official post.
Mr. Khera said that Mr. Puri was then a retired Indian Foreign Service officer. Three Indian ambassadors were posted in Washington during this period but none of them had met Epstein. “Whose brief was Puri carrying?” Mr. Khera asked.
Alleging that Epstein appeared to be attempting to influence foreign policy matters, Mr. Khera cited an email in which Epstein reportedly expressed “strong opinions” on developments in the Middle East.
The Congress leader claimed that the remarks were in reference to a visit by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to India, and questioned whether subsequent diplomatic moves were influenced by such considerations.
“This suggests that our foreign policy was not being run by the Prime Minister or the Foreign Minister, but by a sex predator sitting in the U.S.,” Mr. Khera said, noting that the then External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj did not figure in the Epstein-related documents.
Referring to reports that Mr. Puri had discussed the ‘Digital India’ initiative with Epstein, Mr. Khera asked under what authority such conversations were held prior to the programme’s official announcement.
“On November 13, 2014, Epstein sent an email to [Linked-in co-founder] Reid Hoffman, providing information about ‘Digital India’, even though ‘Digital India’ was launched in July 2015. This means that Hardeep Puri had already informed Epstein about ‘Digital India’ before the citizens of India,” he alleged.

He also accused the Minister of making misleading claims in his public statements, citing emails in which Mr. Puri is reportedly said to have sought meetings with Epstein.
Mr. Khera said that there was more yet to emerge from the Epstein-related material, and the truth would come out in due course.

Stating that the present currency vulnerability has stemmed largely from trade uncertainties that have affected capital flow, Chief Economic Advisor V. Anantha Nageswaran said on Friday that a thrust on expanding the export-driven manufacturing sector should help in stabilising the rupee.
To achieve this, he suggested a three-pronged strategy: import substitution, time-bound protectionism for Indian exporters linked to production and export performance, and investment in climate adaptation before focusing on emission mitigation.
“To be able to export in a world that is increasingly becoming self-centric and to be able to attract capital when capital itself can be held back or used as a strategic weapon isn’t going to be easy. If we don’t get our exports and capital flows correct, the casualty will be the currency. We saw that in 2025,” Mr. Nageswaran said at the inauguration of Tiecon Chennai 2026.

India’s tryst with import substitution between 1947 and the 1980s was fraught with protectionism that did not elevate capabilities or manufacturing capacity, but rather spread complacency. “So, no protection in perpetuity, but protection in return for quid pro quo obligations on productivity and export performance will have to be the mantra for the next 25 years in a world that’s going to be challenging,” he observed.
“Let us be very clear: renewable energy production requires a lot of energy in and of itself,” he said. Giving details, he said large quantities of silver, polysilicon and aluminium, and a substantial input of power were required to produce one gigawatt of solar power. Similarly, for wind power, 2,866 tonnes of copper was required for which at least 4,80,000 tonnes of ore requires handling, given that the yield of copper was only 0.6%.
“We need to invest in climate adaptation, before we focus on emission mitigation. That is where public transportation and demand management both matter,” Mr. Nageswaran added.
Manoj Kumar, CEO, Naandi Foundation and co-founder, ARAKU Coffee, shared his experience of establishing one of the largest certified organic and free trade cooperatives among the tribal residents of the Araku Valley in Andhra Pradesh, which was once a hotbed of the Maoist movement. The valley has around 3,000 villages with about 1,00,000 families. The Naandi Foundation sought to rebuild trust among the community while conserving their deep-rooted values, he said. Each tribal family now owned a coffee estate supplying to the global brand, ARAKU Coffee.
Murugavel Janakiraman, president, TiE Chennai, urged the participating entrepreneurs, industry leaders, investors, and ecosystem partners to embrace technological advancements like AI into their operations.

M.A. Baby, general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), said on Friday (February 13) that when Congress “realises” the importance of holding hands with secular, democratic, and progressive forces, they cooperate with them.
He added that this was not possible in West Bengal due to the “sectarian approach” Congress was allegedly adopting here.
“In the fight against communal forces, especially the BJP, we want to develop political arrangements wherever possible with all forces, including Congress, in the fight against the fascistic RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) and their political party BJP,” Mr. Baby said from the CPI(M) state headquarters in Kolkata on Friday (February 13, 2026). He also added that they are in cooperation with the Congress in Bihar and Tamil Nadu.
This comes days after West Bengal Congress formally announced that they are going solo in the upcoming Assembly elections. Congress had been in a seat-sharing arrangement with the Left Front, including CPI (M), in the last State Assembly elections.
“Politically we want to isolate, expose, and defeat the BJP, which is controlled by the fascistic RSS,” Mr. Baby said. He added that in Bengal it is also their goal to defeat Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress government, which he alleged is an “anti-people government”.
Mr Baby also shared hope that the CPI(M) government will see a resurgence in West Bengal in the upcoming 2026 Assembly elections.
On February 5, Congress announced that it will contest independently in all the 294 Assembly constituencies in West Bengal, ending speculation of any electoral understanding with the Left Front in the polls due in the next few months.
Meanwhile, CPI(M) is looking to find new alliance partners and recently held talks with Humayun Kabir, who has recently set up Janata Unnayan Party (JUP) and is also likely to get into talks with the Indian Secular Front of Naswad Siddique.

--------------------
The Kerala government shall acquire the Kalamassery unit of the Hindustan Machine Tools (HMT), which has been under severe financial distress for long, Centre for Indian Trade Unions (CITU) national vice president K. Chandran Pillai has said.
Mr. Pillai proposed the possibility of transforming the company into a major industrial training facility if such a takeover happens. He was addressing the media at Kalamassery, along with leaders of HMT Employees Union (CITU), on the plight of the employees of the company and the alleged delay in implementing a package promised by Union Minister for Heavy Industries H.D. Kumaraswamy to revive the cash-strapped enterprise.
Asked if the State government could not do anything to revive HMT, Mr. Pillai pointed to the instances of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) acquiring loss-making public sector undertakings, including Hindustan Newsprint Limited, and reviving them.
The LDF government has intervened in certain situations where some Central PSUs were in trouble. When it comes to HMT,  the Centre does not have any such plan. The State government may take an initiative to take over that enterprise, Mr. Pillai said.
“If the government makes such an adventurous intervention or a proposal, the trade unions will support it,” he said.
Earlier, the HMT Employees Union (CITU) had made a similar demand in a memorandum submitted to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan during his Navakerala Sadas outreach programme, union secretary P. Krishnadas said. In January, Industries Minister P. Rajeeve had said that the State government would take a decision if the Centre was ready to hand over the unit to it.
The trade union leaders reiterated their demand to use the money gained from selling the company’s land in Kalamassery for the revival of the State unit. They also demanded an immediate pay revision and recruitment of adequate employees.

Tamil Nadu Minister for Information and Technology and Digital Services on Friday said while India is excellent at “envisioning” and policy-making, the primary challenge remains execution.
“Project management is the bridge needed to close this gap,” he said at the IPMA Global Project Profession Forum 2026 held at Mamallapuram near Chennai. He emphasised the use of “100% pure databases” and AI to democratise citizen services. He highlighted that project management principles must be applied to government schemes to ensure “last-mile” delivery.
The Minister advocated for a shift from intuitive or political decision-making to evidence-based management, where progress is measured by objective metrics rather than effort alone.
N.Ram, Director of The Hindu Group, spoke about the technological shifts in Journalism. He said the BrahMos project is an outstanding example of project management. He pointed out how this particular project was meticulously conceived, planned and executed.
Mladen Vukomanovic, president, IPMA, provided a global perspective on the evolving role of the project professional. He emphasised that success is no longer just about meeting time, budget, and scope. The focus must shift toward value delivery and the long-term social and economic impact of a project.
A. Sivathanu Pillai, president, PMA India, outlined how professional project management is essential for India to reach its goal of becoming a fully developed nation by the centenary of its independence. Drawing on his experience in aerospace and defence, he advocated for a “mission-oriented” management style to tackle challenges such as climate change, energy security, and space exploration. He emphasized that India must not just manage projects but own the technologies behind them.
Kota Harinarayana, former Program Director for Light Combat Aircraft, was conferred with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the event.

Stopping “border killings”, starting negotiations for renewal of the Ganga waters agreement, and increasing the number of medical visas are some of the priority areas for Bangladesh’s incoming government, sources in the Bangladesh Nationalist Party told The Hindu on Friday (February 13, 2026).
The BNP, led by its chairman Tarique Rahman, is set to return to power in Dhaka after two decades, following a landslide victory in the February 12 Parliamentary election, winning an absolute majority of seats.
Giving an insight into the list of deliverables, BNP’s sources said India should urgently deal with the issue of Sheikh Hasina’s presence on Indian soil, as Ms. Hasina has been making comments about the developments in her country.
“Out of all issues, it is the border killings by the Border Security Force of India that create great difficulty for the Government of Bangladesh. Reports of killings in the bordering areas immediately inflame passion, especially in university campuses where protests break out, escalating the situation,” said a source who is working on the neighbourhood projects of the BNP.

The BNP member said that India and Bangladesh have a settled border and it makes no sense to shoot to kill someone. “If someone is suspected of smuggling, then they should be arrested and not fired upon,” the source argued, seeking a more humane approach to the matter.
He further said that India should look into the issue of the continued presence of former Prime Minister Ms. Hasina and her top aides on Indian soil, as the Awami League leader’s comments will pose a challenge to the normalisation of ties and indicated that these issues will be among the first items that would be discussed by the incoming government.
The other big issue that will have to be prioritised, The Hindu was told it is the renewal of the Ganga Waters Treaty that will have to be renewed before December 2026. Indian diplomatic sources had flagged that the technical teams that were supposed to meet to iron out the details of the renewal agreement in the two years did not meet, though the matter featured during the July 2024 visit of Ms. Hasina when she was Prime Minister. Bangladesh will also raise the need to conclude this treaty in a “fair” manner, the source said.
He further said the number of medical visas that are issued by India are inadequate and that India must relax medical visas, as it is a great people-to-people connector. “We are being pushed to go to China in search of medical treatment. If pushed by denial of a medical visa, we will find an alternative, as in today’s world an alternative will present itself automatically, but our cultural commonalities make medical treatment in India a more comfortable process,” said the source, urging India to enhance people-to-people diplomacy.

District Central Cooperative Bank (DCCB) have to give loans to farmers. It is the duty of such financial institutions. They can not escape from such responsibilities saying that it could cause them losses, Satish Jarkiholi , district in-charge Minister said in Belagavi.
He was responding to a statement by Anna Saheb Jolle, Belagavi DCCB chairman, that giving loans to farmers meant loss for the bank, but it was continuing to give loans as per government policies.
“I do not know in what sense the chairman made the statement, but I think it is being wrongly interpreted. Whether the BDCC Bank makes a profit or a loss, it must give loans to farmers. The DCC banks were built for the purpose of giving farm loans. They have to follow the directions of the Union and State governments and RBI. Surely, Mr. Jolle and other directors understand this,’’ the Minister told reporters on Friday.
The BDCC bank is a farmers’ bank and it should give loans to farmers. But farm loans, just as other loans, have to be given only as per the directions of RBI and NABARD. It is a different matter that the bank has been giving non-agricultural loans to private persons and companies, as it has to make profits to sustain and grow. Of course, it is not in the hands of the BDCC bank directors to increase the limits of loans given to farmers. It is the domain of institutions like RBI and NABARD, Mr. Jarkiholi said. He said that Chief Minister Siddaramaiah would accept the demands of all legislators who were seeking funds for the development of their constituencies. However, we have not asked for special funds for Belagavi district.
We are hopeful of getting all requisite funds, including those for irrigation projects, the Minister said.
Mr. Jarkiholi refused to respond to claims by Channaraj Hattiholi, MLC and Congress leader that the time had come for Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar to become the Chief Minister.

The election was held to elect a new government to replace the interim administration, which took charge after the fall of the Awami League regime in August 2024.
In a post on X, Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge said: “On behalf of the Indian National Congress, I congratulate Mr. Tarique Rahman and the BNP for winning the Parliamentary elections in Bangladesh.” India and Bangladesh share deep-rooted bonds of history, language, culture, and multitude of other commonalities, the party chief said.

“A democratic, progressive and inclusive Bangladesh would always be supported by all Indians for the stability and peace of our region,” Mr. Kharge said.
West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool chairperson Mamata Banerjee extended greetings to Mr. Rahman on leading the party to victory in the parliamentary elections.
My hearty congratulations, shubhonandan, to all my brothers and sisters, all the people, in Bangladesh. My advance Ramazan mubarak to all of them.For this great victory, my congratulations to my Tarique-Bhai, his party, and all the parties. Pray, you all be well and happy.…

Ms. Banerjee expressed hope that ties between India and Bangladesh remain cordial. “Wish that our relations with Bangladesh be always cordial,” she said.
The election was seen as a direct contest between the BNP and its former ally Jamaat-e-Islami, in the absence of ousted premier Sheikh Hasina's now debarred Awami League. The BNP was in power last time between 2001 and 2006 when Jamaat was its crucial partner, with two of its leaders serving as ministers.

The Indian Air Force (IAF) conducted an in-situ bilateral exercise with the Royal Thai Air Force (RTAF) in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) from February 9 to 12, 2026, aimed at strengthening military cooperation and enhancing operational synergy between the two countries.
According to the Ministry of Defence, the engagement was executed as an air combat training exercise featuring the IAF’s Su-30MKI multirole fighter aircraft and the RTAF’s SAAB Gripen jets. The IAF’s IL-78 mid-air refuelling tankers enabled extended-range maritime operations, underscoring the force’s long-distance deployment capabilities.
The exercise was conducted under the enhanced surveillance and command network of the IAF’s Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft, while Ground Control Interception (GCI) elements of the RTAF provided coordinated control support, the Ministry added.
IAF assets operated from airbases in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, demonstrating strategic reach into the IOR, while the Thai Gripen fighters were launched from bases in Thailand. The drill showcased interoperability between the two air forces and provided operational exposure, including the exchange of best practices in air combat and maritime domain operations.

The office of the Chief Justice of India (CJI) received 8,630 complaints against sitting judges in the last decade, Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal informed the Lok Sabha on Friday (February 13, 2026).
The information came in response to a question raised in the House by Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) MP V.S. Matheswaran who had sought the database of complaints regarding corruption, sexual misconduct, or other serious impropriety received against judges of the High Courts or the Supreme Court.
Responding to the query, Minister of State for Law and Justice  Arjun Ram Meghwal submitted that 8,360 complaints against judges were recorded between 2016 and 2025. As per the table shared by the Minister, the CJI’s office got 729 complaints against judges in 2016, followed by 682 in 2017, 717 in 2018, and 1,037 in 2019. In 2020 and 2021, such complaints stood at 518 and 686 respectively. In 2022, 1012 complaints were received, followed by 977 in 2023, 1,170 in 2024, and 1,102 in 2025.
Though Mr. Matheswaran asked if any action had been taken on the complaints, the Minister did not address the query in his written reply.
To another question by the MP on whether the Central government was aware of any system maintained by the Supreme Court to document and track complaints related to corruption, sexual misconduct, or other serious impropriety against judges of the higher judiciary, the Minister said that under the existing “in-house procedure”, the Chief Justice of India and the Chief Justices of the High Courts are authorised to receive and handle complaints against judges.
The Minister further noted that complaints submitted through the Centralised Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) or other channels are forwarded to the CJI or the respective High Court Chief Justices.
The MP also enquired if the government intended to introduce guidelines or measures to ensure proper documentation, monitoring, and accountability in dealing with complaints against members of the higher judiciary. However, the Minister did not address it.

Aviation safety watchdog DGCA has imposed a fine of ₹1 crore on Tata Group-owned Air India for operating an Airbus A320 Neo plane without the requisite airworthiness certification on at least eight routes last year, according to sources.
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), on December 2 last year, said it was probing the incident of Air India operating an A320 Neo plane without having a requisite airworthiness certification on at least eight routes.
The sources said on Friday (February 13, 2026) that the regulator has imposed a ₹1 crore fine on Air India for the violations.
"Air India acknowledges the receipt of a DGCA order in relation to an incident that was voluntarily reported back in 2025. All identified gaps have since been satisfactorily addressed and shared with the authority," the airline said in a statement.
On November 26, 2025, the airline informed the DGCA about the flying of the A320 aircraft with the expired airworthiness review certificate (ARC) on eight revenue sectors.
ARC is issued annually in respect of an aircraft after a comprehensive review of its maintenance records, physical condition and verification of compliance with all airworthiness standards. It is a validation of an aircraft's main certificate of airworthiness.
Under the norms, Air India has been delegated the powers to issue the ARC for an aircraft.
Tata Group-owned Air India has previously faced regulatory actions for certain violations as well.

The Treasury benches in the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly were unhappy with the reply given by Revenue Minister Anagani Satya Prasad on Friday that a majority of the petitions and grievances relating to his department had been addressed.
TDP MLAs Dhulipala Narendra, Gorantla Butchaiah Chowdary and others, who raised the question during Question Hour on Friday, said that the petitioners were yet to get justice though they submitted their pleas during the Revenue Sadassulu.
Closing the petitions is not a solution. Rendering justice is necessary. Many stretches of lands are still earmarked under 22 A (prohibited list), making it miserable for the people. Dalits, BCs and everyone are suffering, they said.
Speaker Chintakayala Ayyanna Patrudu, who was in the Chair, directed that State-level meetings with the District Collectors and Joint Collectors concerned be organised to address the issue. The Chief Minister should also be present, he said.
Mr. Satya Prasad informed the House that 2,34,644 applications were received during the Revenue Conferences. Of these, 1,85,731 were related to revenue matters such as land records, mutations, pattas, and other administrative issues, while 48,913 petitions pertained to survey-related concerns, including boundary disputes and land measurements.
Providing further classification, the Minister said 659 grievances were identified as financial in nature involving compensation or monetary claims, while the remaining 2,33,985 were categorised as non-financial issues.
Mr. Satya Prasad said that 2,33,578 complaints have already been resolved. He described the resolution rate as a significant achievement and evidence of the administration’s commitment to transparent and time-bound grievance redressal.
“Some cases are related to family disputes or court cases. The local elders, sarpanches or MLAs can take a lead in solving them,”  the Minister said.
In response, the TDP MLAs  asked, “Do you want us to do Panchayats?”.

Minister for HRD and IT Nara Lokesh on Friday condemned former Minister Ambati Rambabu for “insulting” Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu’s mother.
During a discussion on the Motion of Thanks to the Governor’s address in the Legislative Assembly, Mr. Lokesh questioned how such remarks could be dismissed as “two small words,” He said that insulting any woman, especially a mother, cannot be taken lightly.
He refuted allegations made by YSRCP Legislative Council Floor leader Botcha Satyanarayana and YSRCP MLC B. Israel regarding the arrest of Mr. Ambati Rambabu and their claims that law and order in the State had deteriorated.
“The coalition government does not engage in vendetta politics, but it will take strict action against anyone who speaks disrespectfully about women,” he asserted.
The Minister made it clear that whether it concerned the Chief Minister’s mother, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s mother, or any other woman, the government would not tolerate derogatory remarks. He challenged the opposition party leaders to spell out whether Mr. Ambati Rambabu’s statement was right or wrong, and asked what action was taken during the previous government in similar situations.

Speakers at a workshop on Friday (February 13, 2026) on “Socio-economic impact of GST introduction and reforms on the consumption pattern of the middle and neo middle classes with gender perspective” shed light on the importance of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in bettering the lives of the middle classes, especially women.
The capacity building workshop jointly organised by Sri Padmavati Mahila Viswa Vidyalayam (SPMVV) Department of Women’s Studies and the New Delhi-based Centre for Women’s Development Studies brought together people from various walks of life such as economists, accountants, entrepreneurs, tax experts, and academicians.
CGST & Customs Commissioner (Tirupati) Satish Dhavale shared how the GST streamlined indirect taxation, improved transparency, widened the tax base, and also strengthened compliance mechanisms.
Similarly, the GST 2.0 led to rationalisation of tax rates that resulted in lower taxes and it, in turn, indirectly improved savings. “This increased the purchasing power benefitted the middle and neo-middle class households,” Mr. Dhavale noted.
SPMVV Registrar R. Usha said that such policy-oriented academic programmes would help young researchers in subjects like taxation and public policy gain insights in real-time economic developments.
G. Ramamani, Assistant Commissioner, Central Tax & Customs, explained the practical aspects of GST implementation and its impact on small businesses and women entrepreneurs. A. Parthasaradhi, Chairman of ICMAI, Tirupati, spoke on consumption patterns under GST 2.0, distribution effects and women’s role in decisions pertaining to expenditure.

--------------------
The Kerala Forest department, which had earlier declined a request of the Pangode Military Station, Thiruvananthapuram, to obtain wildlife articles, including ivory, in its safe custody, has been caught off-guard by the reported theft of two ivory pieces from the Officers’ Mess of the station the other day.
The department was unaware of the possession of ivory at the military establishment.
Though the Kerala government was earlier in favour of handing over the articles to the military establishments, it had to backtrack following the objection from the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.
Incidentally, the government had cleared the requests from the Pangode station and the Grenadiers RC for obtaining 10 pairs each of elephant ivory and antlers and 10 mount/horns in its safe custody in 2024. The State government was in favour of handing over three pairs of ivory and antlers from its strongroom to the Madras Regiment. Later, the 4th Battalion of the 8th Gorkha Rifles approached the department for two pairs of ivory to be displayed at its units. However, the Union Ministry  reminded the State government and the department that the Wildlife Protection Act and its rules “do not provide for handing over the wild animal articles/trophies which are the property of the State government, to anyone, including for safe custody.”
The Ministry had also pointed out that the trophies had to be “disposed of in accordance with the Wild Life Disposal of Wild Animal Article Rules, 2023 by way of incineration.” Huge quantities of wildlife articles, including ivory, are stored at the Forest department’sstrongroom in the State headquarters and various offices. The protection and management of the ivory has turned out to be an expensive and cumbersome affair for the department, according to the officials.
Meanwhile, the Forest officials are waiting for a formal communication from the police regarding the theft at the station, worth ₹2 crore, in the intervening night between February 11 and 12, 2026, to act. It is to be seen whether the ivory had reached the military establishment through legal routes. An investigation will be launched after receiving formal communication from the authorities concerned, forest officials said.
The department is in the process of giving finishing touches to the proposal for providing a one-time amnesty for those who could not surrender the wildlife articles in their possession before the expiry of the deadline.
Wild animals and articles are considered government property under the Act, and those owning both the animals and the articles need to obtain ownership certificates from the department, sources pointed out.

Kidwai’s name had earlier surfaced in the Lucknow jailer murder case, in which he was named as an accused by investigating agencies. Police said he had been facing multiple criminal cases and had long posed a law-and-order challenge.
Officials have indicated that early information points to potential internal rivalry and a gang war as the reasons behind the killing. This angle is also under investigation.
In response to the incident, security has been heightened throughout the district, with additional police personnel deployed in sensitive areas. Senior officers visited the crime scene and examined the location, while CCTV footage from nearby areas is being reviewed to identify the attackers.
Superintendent of Police Arpit Vijayvargiya mentioned that the initial investigation suggests the attack was premeditated. A forensic team has gathered evidence, and raids are underway to apprehend the suspects, he added.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday chaired the final meeting of the Union Cabinet at the South Block in New Delhi, marking the end of an era for the British-era Secretariat building.

Several Union Cabinet ministers, Ministers of State (independent charge) were present in the meeting, including:
Amit Shah
Rajnath Singh
Nirmala Sitharaman
S Jaishankar
JP Nadda
Manohar Lal Khattar
Piyush Goyal
Jitan Ram Manjhi
Kinjarapu Rammohan Naidu
Shivraj Singh Chouhan
HD Kumaraswamy
Dharmendra Pradhan
Gajendra Singh Shekhawat
Pralhad Joshi
The cabinet meeting was followed by the PMO’s relocation to ‘Seva Teerth’. This marked the end of an era, as all government departments vacated the North and South blocks — the seat of power since 1921.
The North and South blocks have been the seat of power in the country since 1921. Earlier, the Home Ministry had moved out of the North Block complex at Raisina Hills in Lutyens’ Delhi.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday inaugurated the Seva Teerth complex, the new Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), marking the end of nearly 80 years of operations from South Block at Raisina Hill in New Delhi.
This is the first time the PMO has shifted out of South Block, marking a historic administrative transition after nearly eight decades. Since Independence in 1947, the PMO had operated from South Block, part of the British-era Secretariat complex designed by Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker.
The Seva Teerth complex comprises three structures:
Seva Teerth-1: Houses the PMO with modern workspaces and ceremonial meeting halls.
Seva Teerth-2: Occupied by the Cabinet Secretariat.
Seva Teerth-3: Will host the National Security Council Secretariat and the Office of the National Security Advisor.
Seva Teerth features open-plan interiors, encrypted communications systems, advanced security frameworks and integrated administrative spaces aimed at improving coordination.
The North and South Blocks would be transformed into the world’s largest museum.
The Yuge Yugeen Bharat National Museum is a landmark project designed to document over 5,000 years of Indian civilisational history. Spanning a massive 1.55 lakh square metres, it is set to surpass the British Museum and the Louvre in scale. The name itself, “Yuge Yugeen Bharat", translates from Sanskrit as “everlasting India," reflecting the nation’s unbroken heritage from the Vedic period to the digital age.

--------------------
New Delhi is all set to host the India–AI Impact Summit 2026, announced by Hon’ble Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the France AI Action Summit, the first time in the Global South, from February 16-20.
The Summit charts a path towards a future where the transformative power of AI serves humanity, drives inclusive growth, fosters social development, and promotes people-centric innovations that protect our planet. It also seeks to amplify the voice of the Global South, ensuring that technological advancements and opportunities are shared broadly, not concentrated in a few regions.
With Prime Minister of Mauritius Navinchandra Ramgoolam set to participate, News18 spoke to Jyoti Jeetun, Mauritian Minister of Financial Services and Economic Planning.
Edited excerpts:
Q: India is hosting the AI Action Summit for the first time in the Global South. With Mauritius Prime Minister Dr Navinchandra Ramgoolam attending, how do you see Mauritius aligning with India’s AI vision? Can we expect deeper collaboration in areas like FinTech and digital services?
A: India’s leadership in hosting the AI Action Summit for the Global South is both timely and visionary. We commend Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Government of India for taking this initiative. The participation of our Prime Minister, Navinchandra Ramgoolam, underscores Mauritius’ strong commitment not only to artificial intelligence but also to strengthening our strategic partnership with India.
India has long been a global technology leader. Its IT services exports, skilled technology professionals, and the presence of Indian-origin CEOs leading major global tech firms reflect its technological depth. It is only natural that India is now shaping the next technological revolution through AI.
Mauritius sees significant scope for collaboration in AI-driven financial services, FinTech innovation, digital governance, and cross-border digital infrastructure. We are keen to align with India’s digital transformation journey and explore joint initiatives that can benefit both our economies as well as the wider Global South.
Q: Mauritius is often described as a gateway to Africa. How can India and Mauritius collaborate on trilateral initiatives involving Africa, especially in trade, financial services and technology?
A: Mauritius is strategically positioned between India and Africa, both geographically and economically. We are a member of the African Union, COMESA and SADC, and we share deep historical and economic ties with India.
India is one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world. On the other hand, Africa represents a continent of 1.4 billion people, and notably, 15 of the 25 fastest-growing economies last year were in Africa. This signals tremendous opportunity.
Mauritius offers a stable, transparent and well-regulated financial ecosystem that can serve as a bridge for Indian companies seeking expansion into Africa. We provide legal certainty, financial structuring expertise, and a professional services ecosystem that supports cross-border investments.
With the African Union now a permanent member of the G20 — inducted under India’s presidency — the potential for structured India-Africa engagement has become even stronger. Mauritius can play a catalytic role in enabling that partnership.
Q: Mauritius has traditionally been seen as a tax-efficient jurisdiction for investments into India. How are you positioning the country today as a financial centre?
A: Mauritius’ financial services sector has been built and consolidated over the past three decades. Today, we are ranked first in Africa in the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI), reflecting the strength and credibility of our financial ecosystem.
Our financial centre is built on substance, governance, regulatory rigour and quality. For decades, Mauritius has been among the largest sources of foreign direct investment into India, reflecting mutual trust and structured engagement.
We continue to enhance economic substance requirements, compliance standards and regulatory oversight. Governance and transparency are ongoing priorities, and we are committed to strengthening them further in partnership with global counterparts.
Q: Following India’s recent tax scrutiny after the Tiger Global Management case, some foreign investors are reassessing structures routed through Mauritius. Should investors be concerned? How is Mauritius responding?
A: It would not be appropriate for me to comment on specific judicial rulings. However, what I can say is that Mauritius has proactively strengthened its regulatory and economic substance framework over the past several years.
Our financial sector today is robust, stable and well-regulated. We offer a strong ecosystem of experienced professionals, legal certainty, and a transparent regulatory environment.
We recognise that the global financial landscape is evolving, and Mauritius is continuously adapting to meet new standards and expectations. We are committed to ongoing reforms and engagement with international partners to ensure that investors continue to see Mauritius as a stable and credible financial jurisdiction.
I would reassure investors that Mauritius is focused on reinvention, resilience and long-term sustainability.

TITLE: DGCA Imposes Rs 1 Crore Penalty On Air India For Flying Airbus Without Airworthiness Permit
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/aviation-watchdog-imposes-rs-1-crore-penalty-on-air-india-over-safety-lapses-report-9901838.html
--------------------
Aviation watchdog Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has imposed a penalty of $110,350 (around Rs 1 crore) for operating an Airbus aircraft on eight flights without a valid airworthiness permit, according to a confidential order issued earlier this month, news agency Reuters reported.
An Airbus A320 flew passengers between New Delhi, Bengaluru, Mumbai, and Hyderabad on November 24 to 25 without the mandatory Airworthiness Review Certificate, or ARC, a key permit issued annually by the regulator after a plane passes safety and compliance checks.
As per the order dated February 5, 2026, issued to Air India CEO Campbell Wilson, Joint Director General of Civil Aviation Maneesh Kumar noted that the security lapse had “further eroded public confidence and adversely impacted the safety compliance of the organisation."
An internal investigation conducted by Air India described the incident as a result of “systemic failures" and acknowledged the urgent need to strengthen its compliance culture. The probe also reportedly blamed pilots who operated the eight flights, saying they did not follow standard operating procedures before take-off, the news agency reported.
The regulator held the airline’s accountable manager responsible for the breach and directed the carrier to deposit the penalty within 30 days.
Meanwhile, Air India responded to the DGCA order and said that all flaws have been satisfactorily addressed and shared with the authority.
“Air India acknowledges the receipt of a DGCA order in relation to an incident that was voluntarily reported back in 2025. All identified gaps have since been satisfactorily addressed and shared with the authority.
Air India remains unwavering in its commitment to maintaining the highest standards of operational integrity and safety," an Air India spokesperson said.
The airline has faced increased scrutiny over safety practices in recent months. It had earlier received warnings from the watchdog for operating aircraft without checking emergency equipment and for other audit lapses.
The latest penalty came months after Air India suffered its worst disaster on June 12 after a London-bound Boeing Dreamliner, carrying 242 passengers and crew, including former Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani, crashed into a medical college complex shortly after taking off from Ahmedabad’s Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport. 275 people lost their lives, including 120 men, 124 women, and 16 children.

The Poojappura police have registered a theft case after two elephant tusks, estimated to be worth over Rs 2 crore, were reported missing from the high-security Pangode Military Camp in the Kerala capital.
According to the complaint, the tusks were allegedly stolen from within the camp premises. A case has been filed under Sections 331(4) and 305(e) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).
Police suspect the involvement of a person who had entered the camp premises to organise a DJ party. However, officials said details surrounding the theft remain unclear.
“We currently don’t have any information about the theft. We are gathering the information," the Defence PRO told Onmanorama.
A detailed investigation has been launched to determine how the tusks went missing from the tightly secured defence establishment.
Pangode Military Camp, located in Thirumala in Thiruvananthapuram, functions under the Southern Command of the Indian Army. The base conducts key training activities and hosts joint military exercises. Known for its strict access controls, the camp is considered one of Kerala’s major defence installations.

--------------------
Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya on Friday welcomed the Union Home Ministry’s directive mandating the singing of all six verses of the national song, Vande Mataram, before the national anthem, calling it a “matter of pride."
Speaking to news agency ANI, Maurya said, “Vande Mataram has been notified in the gazette; now all Indians should sing Vande Mataram as the national song. This is a matter of pride, and I congratulate the Home Minister for this."
BJP MP Sudha Murthy also expressed support, stating, “I like Vande Mataram and Jana Gana Mana."
The reactions follow the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) releasing detailed guidelines for the national song, stating that when both the national song and the national anthem are performed at an event, all six stanzas of the official version of Vande Mataram must be presented first.
Earlier on Thursday, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Mohan Yadav welcomed the directive, saying the state government would implement it immediately. Speaking to reporters, CM Yadav said, “I not only approve of the decision by the Home Ministry, under the leadership of the Prime Minister, to sing six verses of Vande Mataram before Jana Gana Mana, but also I feel joy that this decision by our Prime Minister will bring the entire nation together with us to remember all those who sacrificed their lives for the country before independence. We are fortunate that the Prime Minister has decided to sing the entire Vande Mataram. The Madhya Pradesh government also supports this decision, and we will implement it immediately in our state."
Madhya Pradesh School Education Minister Uday Pratap Singh also praised the move, noting its potential to inspire nationalism among future generations. He said, “I believe this auspicious day has arrived quite late. The work that should have been done years ago has now been carried out by Prime Minister Modi. I proudly say that this decision will become a major role to inspire a sense of nationalism among the coming generations in India. I thank Prime Minister Modi from the bottom of my heart, and I feel proud that a decision which should have been taken much earlier was implemented during his tenure."
On implementation in schools, Singh added, “Most schools and institutions follow this on their own, but I believe that when something becomes law, it naturally becomes mandatory for every institution and school to implement it. I would say this is a very good decision."
The move has received widespread support, with leaders hailing it as a step toward fostering national pride and unity.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has always been in favour of the farmers and continues to prioritise their welfare in international trade agreements, said Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Shivraj Singh Chouhan.
Taking to X, Chouhan said, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has always been in favour of the farmers. All his decisions have been taken in favour of the farmers. His plans have changed their lives."
Talking about the recent trade agreement signed with the United States, the Union Minister said that the deal is designed to protect the interests of the domestic agricultural sector.
Chouhan noted that the Prime Minister’s decisions consistently aim to improve the lives of those in the farming community through strategic planning and policy shifts.
The Agriculture Minister emphasised that the agreement specifically addresses the needs of farmers who produce various staples. “The farmers who produce grains like wheat, rice, corn, soya and other grains have been taken care of," Chouhan said.

He further explained that the deal ensures protection for those involved in different segments of the industry. According to the Minister, “The farmers who produce fruits and vegetables have also been protected in this agreement."
Talking about the exposure to the international market, Chouhan said that beyond spices, several other commodities are expected to benefit from increased international exposure. “Spices, coffee, tea, marine products, and many other things will get a new market," he said.
Union Minister Dharmendra Singh Pradhan also talked about PM Modi’s visionary leadership and said that “India will never compromise on the interests of our ‘Annadatas’."
“Farmers’ interests are fully protected, dairy and poultry are safeguarded, and exports are expanding, directly strengthening livelihoods," Pradhan said, adding, “On the global stage, India has delivered a historic win by securing duty-free access to the US for garment and textile exports, injecting fresh momentum into industry, manufacturing, and India’s global economic presence.

In addition to this, the Minister also slammed Rahul Gandhi and Congress party for spreading misinformation, theatrics, and divisive politics.
Accusing the Congress of doing nothing to address the real concerns of our farmers, Pradhan attacked them for repeatedly tying to downplay India’s global achievements. “Their politics thrives not on solutions, but on denial, distortion, and manufactured outrage," he added.
Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal also on Thursday hit out at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, calling him a “habitual liar" and accusing him of misleading farmers with what he termed a “fake narrative" regarding the recent trade agreement with the United States.
In a self-made video posted on X, Goyal alleged that Rahul Gandhi had “broken all records of speaking falsehood" and made “baseless allegations" in a video released earlier in the day.

He further accused the Congress leader of attempting to provoke farmers.
“Rahul Gandhi is a habitual liar…In a video released today, he has broken all records of speaking falsehood and made baseless allegations. He is misleading our farmers with his fake narrative and trying to provoke them," he said.
“Prime Minister Narendra Modi has always been empathetic towards our farmers. He has always put the interest of farmers first and taken all decisions to ensure their prosperity…In the recent trade deal with the United States of America, the interests of farmers have been kept paramount and fully protected…," Goyal said in the video.

--------------------
Maharashtra’s Cultural Affairs Minister, Ashish Shelar, has formally received the UNESCO World Heritage certificate recognising twelve forts associated with Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. The certificate was accepted at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris, marking the completion of a long process that brought global recognition to the historic Maratha military network.
The forts were inscribed last year under the title ‘Maratha Military Landscapes of India’ during the 47th session of UNESCO held on July 11, 2025. After technical presentations and follow-up documentation by the Maharashtra government delegation, the official recognition document has now been handed over. Officials described it as an important cultural moment not only for the state but for the country’s historical legacy.
Maharashtra Chief Minister, Devendra Fadnavis, also expressed joy over the development.

The group includes Raigad, Rajgad, Pratapgad, Panhala, Shivneri, Lohgad, Salher, Sindhudurg, Suvarnadurg, Vijaydurg, Khanderi and Gingee Fort in Tamil Nadu. Built across mountains and coastline, these forts formed a strategic defence system during Shivaji Maharaj’s rule. Historians regard the network as a unique example of military planning combined with governance and public welfare.
The state government said the recognition places India’s indigenous fort architecture on the global heritage map. During his visit, Shelar also paid tribute to B. R. Ambedkar at the UNESCO premises, where Maharashtra had installed his bust on Constitution Day last year. The memorial symbolises values of equality, education, and social justice, which align with UNESCO’s ideals.
Calling the honour emotional and historic, the minister thanked national and state leadership for support throughout the nomination process. Officials present at the ceremony included India’s Permanent Representative to UNESCO, Vishal Sharma, and senior officers from the cultural and archaeology departments. The state government said the recognition will help conservation efforts and increase global awareness of Maharashtra’s heritage. For many in the state, the acknowledgement is seen as a tribute to Shivaji Maharaj’s vision and a reminder of the region’s enduring historical identity.
Tourism officials believe the World Heritage status will encourage responsible tourism while ensuring better preservation of the forts. Plans are being discussed to improve visitor facilities, signage, and guided interpretation without disturbing the original structures. Conservation experts say global recognition also brings stricter monitoring standards, which will help protect the sites from damage and unplanned development. For local communities living around the forts, the move is expected to create livelihood opportunities through heritage tourism and cultural activities.

--------------------
The Maharashtra government has announced a broad plan to improve living conditions in Mumbai, aiming to turn the city into what it described as a “drug-free and world-class" urban centre. Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde shared the roadmap after a meeting of the Mumbai City District Planning Committee on Wednesday.
The government said that the new approach will combine health, housing, civic works and enforcements measures at the same time. The coordinated action will bring quicker and more visible results for residents.
One major focus is tackling substance abuse. Every municipal hospital will open de-addiction, counselling and rehabilitation facilities under a city-wide anti-drug campaign. Authorities will also push stalled housing schemes and speed up cluster redevelopment, while continuing work on large affordable housing projects across Mumbai.
With monsoon approaching, civic agencies have been instructed to complete road repairs, desilting of drains and flood prevention work.
The Maharashtra Deputy CM said that the first phase of concrete roads has already been finished and the second phase is nearing completion, with the next phase to start soon.

Waterlogging points will get pumping systems, holding ponds will remain operational and damaged asphalt roads will be repaired.
Encroachments on footpaths will be cleared through a special drive to improve pedestrian safety. At the same time, authorities have been told to consider the livelihoods of those affected.
Traffic congestion near railway stations and markets will be addressed through coordination between multiple agencies. Mobile toilets and women-only “pink toilets" will be placed in crowded areas, and maintenance of public toilets will be tightened.
The plan also includes pollution control measures. Construction sites, both private and government, will have to use sprinklers and protective netting to reduce dust and improve air quality.
In healthcare, the government aims to widen coverage under the public health scheme to include expensive treatments such as angiography and stent procedures. Hospitals have been directed to ensure medicines are provided free to patients after inspections found some were still purchasing them outside facilities.
Police and district authorities have additionally been instructed to identify illegal foreign nationals and take legal action where required.
Shinde said the government wants to provide immediate relief while also planning long-term improvements so that the city becomes cleaner, safer and better prepared through coordinated efforts rather than isolated projects.
For Mumbaikars, the announcement raises cautious hope. Many of these promises have been made before, but citizens say the real test will be daily experience — cleaner streets, smoother travel, and reliable public services. If departments work together and deadlines are met, the impact could be visible quickly. Otherwise, it risks becoming another plan on paper. The government now faces the challenge of turning intent into visible change across neighbourhoods.

TITLE: Ahead of State budget, resident welfare associations demand focus on civic infrastructure

With the Tamil Nadu and the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) Budget announcements fast approaching, some Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) have put forth a charter of expectations, urging the authorities to focus on long-pending basic infrastructure works.
Harsha Koda of the Federation of OMR Resident Associations (FOMRRA) alleged that residents of Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR) had been waiting for more than 15 years for basic civic amenities such as piped water supply and underground sewage connections. He said many roads also lack proper stormwater drains (SWD), citing the Model School Road in Sholinganallur, where nearly 7,000 apartments lack a functional SWD system, resulting in frequent flooding during the monsoon.
Across the OMR stretch, which has an estimated one lakh apartments, stormwater drains have been laid only in a few smaller lanes and remain largely unconnected, making them incapable of handling heavy or continuous rainfall, he said. Mr. Koda further said that despite repeated budgetary allocations for stormwater and drainage projects by the Tamil Nadu government and the GCC since 2016, implementation has been inadequate.
He added that Sholinganallur, a key part of Chennai’s IT corridor and a major contributor through property and sales taxes, has not received commensurate infrastructure investment to address these long-pending issues.
The Alliance of Resident Welfare Associations has called on the GCC to allocate funds in the interim Budget for a technical audit and rectification of stormwater drains, restoration of roads, and completion of pending infrastructure works.
The association also sought transparency in contracts and expenditure, adherence to quality standards in water management, and the setting up of a swift grievance redress mechanism to reduce flood risk.
Stressing that durable, basic civic infrastructure must take precedence over “cosmetic, temporary measures and freebies”, it urged the authorities to ensure sustainable development and to revisit the proposal to expand waste-to-energy capacity at the Kodungaiyur dumpyard.
Gomathinayagam, president of the Neelangarai Residents’ Welfare Association, said that though the overhead tank under the Nemmeli Desalination Plant project was inaugurated by Chief Minister M.K Stalin about 10 days ago, water supply to households is yet to commence.
Residents have also expressed concern over the lack of clarity on connection charges, with some stating that the cost could be as high as ₹80,000. Installation of water meters is still awaited, he added.
Further, he flagged delays in the widening of the 8.8 km to 10.5 km stretch from Thiruvanmiyur to Akkarai into six lanes, which is over 50% complete but remains stalled due to land acquisition issues. Also, three proposed iron-girder bridges linking ECR and OMR have not yet been taken up, he said.
T.R. Subhash, general secretary of the Sarathy Nagar Residents’ Welfare Association, said a six-vent culvert located behind a saree retail hall in Velachery carries floodwater from Sarathy Nagar, Tansi Nagar, Bhuvaneswari Nagar, VGP Nagar, and Selva Nagar.
However, the culvert has no proper outlet to the Pallikaranai marshland, leading to recurrent water stagnation. Though funds are reportedly allocated every year, the work has not been executed so far, he said. He added that the area has witnessed a reduction in bus services over the years, underscoring the need for a dedicated bus terminus. Direct connectivity to Kilambakkam or Koyambedu would benefit a large number of residents, he said, pointing out that many currently spend around ₹600 on cab fares to reach Kilambakkam.
Kathiravan Duraisamy of Maduravoyal said RWAs across the constituency have urged the authorities to prioritise completion of long-pending civic works over announcing new projects.
Residents seek regulation of heavy vehicle movement through residential areas, maintenance of existing parks, walking tracks, and senior citizen-friendly amenities. They have flagged basic infrastructure gaps in Nolambur, Vanagaram, Alapakkam and surrounding areas that continue to affect daily life, including damaged interior roads, persistent waterlogging during rain, inadequate stormwater drainage, irregular water supply, and poor waste management.
“The residents called for expediting completion of stormwater drain networks in interior roads and regular desilting of canals before the monsoon, as incomplete or poorly connected systems often aggravate flooding,” he added.
He said citizens also sought expansion of Metro water supply and underground drainage to all streets, and the setting up of localised waste composting units.

Chief Minister M. K. Stalin on Saturday inspected the ongoing work for the ₹15 crore sports complex in Tirupattur.
Along with Collector K. Sivasoundaravalli, and Minister for Public Works E.V. Velu, Mr. Stalin inspected the  sports complex area. “The new facility will encourage youngsters in diverse sports activities in the district to compete at the State and national level competitions. The new facility will be ready in 2026,” R. Jayakumari, District Sports Officer (Tirupattur), told The Hindu.
Officials of the Public Works Department (PWD), which executes the work, said that until now, sports activities at the district level were conducted in colleges that have playgrounds.  Most of the playgrounds do not have modern facilities, training areas, civic amenities for sportspersons and visitors. “The new sports complex will help young sportspersons to train themselves throughout the year,” said B. Santhosh, a student.
Spread over 10 acres, the new sports complex, which will be maintained by the Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu (SDAT) will be built on the temple land of HRCE. The new complex will have a spectator’s gallery with a seating capacity of over 3,500 to watch football games and athletic events.
The new sports facility will have eight separate tracks for 400 metres athletics training, two courts each for basketball, volleyball, table tennis, badminton, tennis, kabaddi, football. Javelin throw can also be practiced at the facility.
Among civic amenities, the new facility will have an administrative block, separate accommodation and changing rooms for sportspersons, washrooms, water taps, CCTV cameras, and a modern gym. Parking facilities for two-wheelers, cars, and buses will be provided. Rainwater harvesting system and storm water drains will be built.
Unlike other district sports complexes, the new facility in Tirupattur will have an open-air theatre where award ceremonies, video presentations by coaches, and other events can be done. Around 200 persons can be accommodated in the theatre. Landscaping will be done and a hockey stadium will also be built.

TITLE: What has government laid down on AI labelling? | Explained
LINK: https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/what-has-government-laid-down-on-ai-labelling-explained/article70633146.ece
--------------------
The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Amendment Rules, 2026 require social media platforms to “prominently” label “synthetically generated” content, or AI-generated images and videos. Image used for representation only.

The story so far: The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) earlier this week notified an amendment to the IT Rules, 2021, that would require users and social media platforms to label AI-generated content, and tighten the takedown timelines for all content — not just AI-generated posts — from 24-36 hours to two to three hours. The rules come into effect on February 20.
The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Amendment Rules, 2026 require social media platforms to “prominently” label “synthetically generated” content, or AI-generated images and videos. The requirement was first proposed in October last year, and was notified this week. Social media platforms with more than five million users are required to obtain a “user declaration [for AI-generated content] and [conduct] technical verification before publishing [AI-generated content]”.
MeitY said in an explanatory document that this requirement was introduced to counter “deepfakes, misinformation, and other unlawful content capable of misleading users, causing users harm, violating privacy, or threatening national integrity,” and that it was important that users be aware whether what they are viewing is inauthentic.
The October draft definition of “Synthetically Generated Information” (SGI) was wider, encompassing any audiovisual content that was AI-modified or generated. The final rules carve out some exemptions: for instance, smartphone-clicked photos that are retouched automatically by the camera app will not be considered SGI, and special effects in films will not be considered something that needs to be labelled. The rules also prohibit certain types of SGI: child sexual exploitation and abuse material, forged documents, information on developing explosives, and deepfakes falsely representing a real person.
The government has asked large platforms to “deploy reasonable and appropriate technical measures to prevent unlawful SGI, and to ensure labelling/provenance/identifier requirements for permissible SGI”. A senior official at the IT Ministry argued that large platforms have sophisticated tools to detect SGI, and that this requirement merely requires them to perform detection that they are already doing. Additionally, some AI firms and platforms have participated in the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), which offers technical standards to invisibly label AI-generated content in a way that can be read by other platforms, in case AI-based detection fails. The rules allude to this effort by requiring “provenance/identifier requirements,” but the official said they don’t want to endorse any single effort, but would like to formalise the aims of such collaborations.
The IT Rules enable some government authorities and police officials to issue takedown notices under Rule 3(1)(b), and users to send in grievances for “illegal” categories of content enumerated in the IT Rules. Those categories include misinformation, nudity, and threats to sovereignty. For both government- and court-issued takedown notices, the timelines have been reduced to 2-3 hours, while for all other categories of user complaints (like defamation and misinformation), the response timelines have been reduced from two weeks to one week. The timelines for responding to user reports (under Rule 3(2)(b)) on “sensitive” content has also been slashed from 72 hours to 36 hours. The government reasoned that the previous limits allowed a lot of damage to be done even within those timelines, necessitating a revisit of the time platforms have to act.
EDITORIAL | Too fake to be good: On AI-generated imagery, labelling
Users will now have to receive a reminder of platforms’ terms and conditions more often. “The amendments include revisions to Rule 3(1)(c) of the Intermediary Rules, increasing the frequency of user notifications from once every year to at least once every 3 (three) months, and expanding the content of such notifications to clarify potential consequences of non-compliance and reporting obligations,” JSA Advocates and Solicitors said in an analysis.
The rules also require platforms to specifically warn users that harmful deepfakes and other illegal AI-generated content could expose them to legal action, including the disclosure of their identity to law enforcement agencies and “immediate disabling of access or removal of such content, suspension or termination of user accounts”, JSA said in its analysis.

Criticising the Mamata Banerjee government on several fronts relating to education, Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Saturday said that West Bengal lost Central funds worth ₹10,000 crore by not implementing the National Education Policy (NEP) in the State.
“Despite repeated requests, the NEP was not implemented in West Bengal by the State government. The policy talks about education in the mother tongue, and in West Bengal, that would have been Bengali. The State government does not want to allow education in Bengali,” Mr. Pradhan said while addressing a teachers’ conference organised by the Bengal unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Kolkata on Saturday.
The Union Minister said that had the NEP been implemented, additional funds would have been given to the State under the Samagra Shiksha Mission. Mr. Pradhan also accused the Mamata Banerjee government of siphoning off funds from the midday meal scheme.
Mr. Pradhan cited various statistics to argue that the education system in West Bengal had deteriorated during the Trinamool Congress regime in the state. The Minister said that West Bengal accounted for nearly 50 % of the total schools in the country that do not have a single teacher. “The maximum number of teacher-less schools in the country is in West Bengal. The figure is around 4,000, which is almost 50 % of the national figure,” he said.
The BJP leader said that internet penetration in state-run schools is just 16 % in West Bengal, compared to the national average of 70 %.
State Education Minister Bratya Basu refuted the charges made by the Union Minister and said that the State Education Policy (SEP) was adopted in 2023, where all acceptable aspects of the NEP have been incorporated.
“Policies that protect the interests of West Bengal and those already practised in the State have also been included. The State Education Policy is more advanced. Education being on the concurrent list, the Bengal government is empowered to follow its own policy,” the State Education Minister said.
On the charge of the Union Minister that the State has the highest number of teacher-less schools in the country, Mr. Basu claimed that there are inconsistencies in this information for various reasons.
“The education portal includes several private aided schools whose teacher count became zero and were consequently shut down. However, due to their UDISE numbers, they are still shown as government schools on the portal. These have been identified, and a corrected portal will be published shortly,” the West Bengal Education Minister said.
On low penetration of internet, Mr. Basu said that all government upper primary, secondary and Higher Secondary schools in the state were provided internet facilities long ago.
The State Education Minister also refuted charges of siphoning out of mid day meal funds and said that the claims were “baseless and unfounded allegation”. “If any such complaint is found anywhere, anyone can file an FIR regarding the matter, none of which has come to the knowledge of the Government,” Mr. Basu.

--------------------
A two-day state-level wrestling event titled “Maati Ka Bal - Dangal” commenced on Saturday (February 14, 2026) at Jamui’s Sri Krishna Singh Memorial Stadium in which nearly 200 wrestlers participated.
Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Choudhary inaugurated the event in the presence of Sports Minister Shreyasi Singh and Vishal Singh, President of Wrestling Association of Bihar.
The tournament which has been jointly organised by Bihar State Sports Authority (BSSA) and Wrestling Association of Bihar has five men’s weight categories of 50 to 60 kg, 60 to 70 kg, 70 to 80 kg, 80 to 90 kg and 90 kg and above and two women’s categories of 50 to 60 kg and 60 kg and above. It is second edition of the tournament after being organised last year.

He further said, “The Mati Ka Bal: Dangal, being organised in Jamui for the first time, is a platform for social and cultural unity. This competition, which brings to life Bihar’s traditional wrestling, is a confluence of Bihar’s tradition, bravery, and culture.”
Mr. Choudhary asserted that infrastructure for the development of sports is being rapidly constructed throughout Bihar so that more international-level athletes can be produced in Bihar.
“It is our resolve to promote prosperity in Bihar through a spirit of sportsmanship, and the Central and State governments are jointly making every possible effort and support to achieve this,”Mr. Choudhary said.
A total of 188 wrestlers, 162 men and 26 women are participating in the tournament. Crafted in 1954, the mace has become a symbol of excellence in the sport since it was presented to wrestler Vishwanath Singh in 1975 on being conferred with the ‘Bihar Kesari’ title.
Ms. Singh, who is also the local MLA while greeting the people and thanking the organizers, said, “I was very excited when I heard about the Dangal competition being held in Jamui because the soil of Jamui is full of sporting talent. The athletes here are excelling in every sport.”
She further said, “Bihar is also establishing its own identity internationally in the field of sports. The government is committed to the all-round development of sports, and we are continuously providing every possible support and effort to achieve this.”
Commonwealth Games gold medalist shooter Ms. Singh asserted that the dream and goal is to ensure the participation of as many players from Bihar as possible in the Olympics in the future.
“As an athlete and sports minister, I assure you all that no effort will be spared to help Bihar reach new heights in the field of sports,”Ms. Singh said.
Mr. Singh, also greeted everyone present at the opening ceremony. Till the filing of the report, the details of first day matches was not shared by the BSSA.

Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar on Saturday said that if the Union government accords requisite permissions for major irrigation projects of Karnataka — Upper Krishna, Mekedatu , Mahadayi and Yettinahole — the Congress government would be able to provide “water guarantee” as the “seventh guarantee.”
Addressing a rally in Haveri to distribute title deeds to beneficiaries, described as the “sixth guarantee”, which coincided with the Congress government completing 1,000 days in office, Mr. Shivakumar said that the government had decided to give compensation to the tune of ₹35 lakh to ₹40 lakh to farmers who part with their land for the Upper Krishna Project.
“Owing to effective arguments in the Supreme Court, we have received a favourable order towards the balancing reservoir on Cauvery at Mekedatu. We are readying DPR for the project. On Mahadayi, the Forest Department has not given the necessary permissions,” he said. Speaking on the Yettinahold project, he said that if the permission is given within three months, then the State government would be able to complete the work of supplying drinking water to Chickballapur and Kolar.
A host of Ministers including Krishna Byre Gowda, Shivanand Patil, H.K. Patil, Satish Jarkiholi, K.H. Muniyappa, G. Parameshwara and over 20 legislators took part in the convention at Haveri.

The Indian Space Research Organisation hasn’t lost its confidence due to the recent consecutive failures of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and may resume launches from June or July, Union Minister of State for Science and Technology Jitendra Singh said on Saturday.
“We are doing the pre-runs. If all goes according to our timeline, [the launch] may be by June or July,” he told reporters after inaugurating a two-day Research, Industry, Startup, and Entrepreneurship Conclave 2026 organised by the Centre for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in Chennai. Gaganyaan, ISRO’s first crewed space mission, was slated for 2027 and would proceed as scheduled, he said. The organisation was in the final stages of test flights with humanoid robot Vyommitra on board. This would possibly happen before the end of the year, he added.
“We have 18 launches in 2026. Not a single launch has been cancelled. Out of that, we have six private parties and they have also not withdrawn,” Dr. Singh said.
Speaking about the conclave, Dr. Singh said the Centre had announced a ₹1-lakh crore research, development, and innovation fund to help accelerate entrepreneurs to technology readiness level (TRL) 4. Similarly, soon after moving into his new office, the Prime Minister had announced a ₹10,000-crore fund for supporting deep tech start-ups. The CSIR too had relaxed conditions for deep tech start-ups having to sustain themselves for three years before qualifying for government financial support.
Tamil Nadu, he noted, had two vibrant entrepreneurship ecosystems in Chennai and Coimbatore. He said the Centre would coordinate with the Tamil Nadu government and the private sector to provide a fillip to the start-up ecosystem.
Earlier, at the inaugural function, Dr. Singh said the Ministry had stopped working in silos and had adopted a more integrated approach to work in tandem with the industry and academia.
M. Ravichandran, Secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences, said that there were ample opportunities for start-ups in climate change-related research, services, sustainability, and disaster mitigation. The government, he said, had a lot of data and could enable startups to bring fast delivery of various services. Giving examples, he said there were opportunities for hyper local weather forecast, precision agriculture, carbon accounting tools, or user specific services of many things related to climate change.
At the event, the CSIR signed memoranda of understanding with academic institutions and their incubation centres to strengthen collaboration.
Among those who were present at the inaugural were N. Kalaiselvi, Secretary, Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and Director General, CSIR, K. Ramesha, Director, CSIR-Central Electrochemical Research Institute, N. Anandavalli, Director, CSIR-Structural Engineering Research Institute, P. Thanikaivelan, Director, CSIR-Central Leather Research Institute, and K.J. Sreeram, Scientist H, CSIR.

--------------------
Health experts have pointed out that the allocation of ₹19,264 crore to the Health Department in the Budget 2026–27 is disappointing, as it shows no significant increase compared with the revised estimates for 2025–26, which stood at ₹17,637.24 crore.
While the allocations to the sector have increased significantly from ₹11,673 crore in the year 2020-21, experts said that the health outlay for the year 2026-27 is falling short of the requirements set by the National Health Policy-2017. The policy had suggested that the State governments spend more than 8 per cent of their total budget on health by 2020. However, the A.P. government is yet to reach the goal, as this year’s allocations are 5.81 per cent of the total Budget.
Kameswara Rao of Praja Arogya Vedika said, “The government does not seem to have factored in inflation and rising disease burden. We expected measures for special tribal packages and strengthening of Public Distribution System.” Last week, the organisation had urged the government to allocate at least 2.5 per cent of the State’s gross domestic product (GSDP) to health. “The Budget estimates for 2026-27 is nowhere near the goal,” he added.
Responding positively to the Budget, D. Jayadheer Babu of the Government Doctors’ Association said that the State government has helped those in need beyond the Budgetary framework as well.
This year, the government allocated ₹4,000 crore for the Dr. NTR Vaidya Seva Trust, which is the same as the allocations made in the year 2025-26 and 2024-25. It may be noted that the State government already has outstanding dues amounting to ₹3,000 crore in the current financial year, payable to the network hospitals.
“The annual budget of running the scheme itself is ₹4,000 crore. With a total budget of ₹4,000 crore for the scheme, how is the government intending to clear the pending dues? It appears that the government is not serious with the allocations, as they seem to have taken no corrective measures,” said Dr. Vijay Kumar, president of the A.P. Speciality Hospitals Association.
The association has approached the High Court for intervention in the matter. The members have said failure to address this issue promptly may severely affect the participation of specialty hospitals in government health schemes, ultimately impacting patient care.

An FIR has been registered against 10 students following a protest on the Osmania University campus demanding allowing of outsiders inside the hostel and the removal of the Director of Campus Hostels for Women.
The case was booked by the Osmania University (OU) police under various sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita based on a complaint lodged by the university’s Chief Security Officer, Raza Khan, said a senior officer from the OU police.
According to the complaint, the female students residing in the Centenary Hostel staged a protest seeking the removal of Prof. Kalyani Laxmi, Director of Campus Hostels for Women. “The protest was reportedly triggered by her decision not to permit outsiders to stay in the campus hostel, which the complainant stated was against university rules,” said the officer.
Sources said that one of the woman student wanted her ailing mother to stay with her in the hostel, which was flagged as a health risk concern by the management.
The Chief Security Officer alleged that the students blocked the road opposite the Arts College and obstructed vehicular movement from the night of February 11 8 p.m. until 9 a.m. on February 12. He stated that despite requests from the police to clear the road, the students continued their protest and raised slogans against the police.
He further alleged that the protest was in violation of a university circular prohibiting demonstrations on campus. Police said an investigation is underway.

--------------------
Riding high on the development plank, the ruling Congress pulled off a clean sweep in Dharmapuri municipal election winning all the 15 wards in the civic body.
The civic body in the famous temple town of Dharmapuri in Jagtial district delivered a decisive mandate in favour of the Congress much to the delight of the rank and file of the ruling party.
Congress circles claim the party’s emphatic victory in Dharmapuri as a strong endorsement of the State government’s governance model.
Despite the no-holds-barred campaign by former minister Koppula Eshwar, the BRS failed to secure even a single ward in Dharmapuri municipality.
Political analysts credit the massive scale of Congress victory in Dharmapuri to the vigorous election campaign by Social Welfare Minister Adluri Laxman Kumar, who represents Dharmapuri constituency in the Assembly.
The Congress election campaign centred around the State government’s welfare schemes, including women-centric programmes and development initiatives.
Elated over the party’s clean sweep in Dharmapuri municipality, Mr. Laxman thanked voters for their trust and promised accelerated development of the temple town.

All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary K.C. Venugopal, MP, said here on Saturday that a substantial portion of the United Democratic Front (UDF) votes would be from Left-leaning voters in the upcoming Assembly elections.
He said that the people in Kerala feared that yet another victory for the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] would create a Bengal-like situation in the State.
“After witnessing the State government’s failures, even its allies are under stress. Many who support Communist ideals may react without fully grasping the situation,” he said.
“People like K. Satchidanandan and Premkumar reacted. Since Mr. Satchidanandan is a nationally recognised figure, he was spared; but Mr. Premkumar was sidelined,” he said.
Mr. Venugopal described the Global Ayyappa  Meet organised by the government as the biggest scam Kerala witnessed in recent times. “The CPI(M) must stop exploiting temples and religious centres for scams,” he said.

--------------------
Kerala Tourism has launched an international digital campaign titled ‘Travel Now, Post Later,’ encouraging travellers to immerse themselves fully in their experiences before sharing them online. The initiative promotes mindful travel, urging visitors to prioritise presence over performance and genuine emotional connection over instant digital validation.
As digital fatigue increasingly shapes travel behaviour, constant documentation often replaces lived experiences, leaving little room for travellers to truly absorb the places they visit and the people they meet. ‘Travel Now, Post Later’ envisions a mindful travel movement that fosters deeper connections and more intentional journeys — beyond destinations and borders.
The campaign will be rolled out across Kerala Tourism’s official digital platforms and supported by a dedicated microsite, which showcases the campaign’s philosophy, curated content, and practical tools designed to encourage more conscious travel. Through this initiative, Kerala Tourism aims to position itself as a thought leader by sparking a broader global conversation about how the world travels — reframing travel as an act of presence that nurtures awareness, reflection, and authentic connections with people and places.
The campaign’s core messaging centres on presence-led journeys, deeper emotional engagement, and alignment with wellness, slow living, and mindful exploration. It also underscores respect for local cultures, communities, and natural environments.
“As a trendsetter, Kerala Tourism has embraced the concept of mindful travel to align future journeys through the State with the evolving global tourism landscape, where travellers increasingly seek immersive experiences and meaningful emotional connections with the communities they encounter,” Tourism Minister P.A. Mohamed Riyas said.
Describing the initiative as a movement that resonates with travellers worldwide, beyond destinations and borders, the Minister added that the dedicated microsite brings together the campaign philosophy, travel tips, and curated destinations across Kerala to inspire more conscious and responsible travel choices.

State Police Chief (SPC) Ravada Chandrasekhar on Saturday said the investigation being carried out by a Special Investigation Team (SIT) into the Sabarimala gold loss case is in its final stage and is progressing in a proper manner.
The probe is conducted under the supervision of the High Court, which is closely monitoring the investigation, the SPC told reporters here.
“The SIT is doing a good job. They are investigating [the case] well. The High Court is conducting its proper supervision,” he said.
The SIT is almost coming to the end of their investigation, Mr. Chandrasekhar added.
The Sabarimala gold loss cases pertain to the alleged misappropriation of gold from the Dwarapalaka (guardian deity) idols and the Sreekovil (sanctum sanctorum) door frames at the Ayyappa temple following the replating of the claddings on the artefacts.

Seven doctors posted in Sikar district were suspended and criminal proceedings initiated against a hospital and a diagnostic centre in Rajasthan in a crackdown on fraud in the State government’s health scheme. The action followed an audit which detected discrepancies in the scheme’s implementation.
Rajasthan’s Principal Secretary for Health Gayatri Rathore said here on Saturday (February 14, 2026) that the doctors at Shri Kalyan Government Hospital and the Government Medical College, both in Sikar, and the Community Health Centre at Kheerwa were found involved in irregularities in the Rajasthan Government Health Scheme (RGHS) for government employees and pensioners.
Ms. Rathore said that first information reports (FIRs) were also being registered against the Bharatpur Nursing Home in Bharatpur and Bothra Diagnostic and Imaging Centre in Bikaner. Instructions for initiating criminal proceedings have been given to the Chief Medical and Health Officers of the two districts.
The investigation revealed a collusion between the Bharatpur Nursing Home and Kashish Pharmacy to generate fake claims using the RGHS beneficiary cards. The patients were treated without the RGHS approval and fraudulent claims were raised through the pharmacy, causing financial loss to the State exchequer.
In the case of Bothra Diagnostic Centre, the patients were subjected to unnecessary diagnostic tests, while the prescriptions carried forged signatures and seals of doctors who were either on leave or not posted in the hospital’s out-patient department during the relevant period.
Earlier, 19 FIRs were registered regarding irregularities in RGHS by the hospitals, pharmacies and beneficiaries, 64 medical personnel were suspended, and about 500 RGHS beneficiary cards were blocked. Ms. Rathore said that over ₹32 crore was recovered from the hospitals found involved in irregularities and de-empanelled on these charges.

Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy asked his Cabinet colleagues to focus their efforts on the 36 municipalities and municipal corporations that returned hung verdicts in the recent civic polls and ensure that the Congress emerges with control in the maximum number of urban local bodies.
Chairing a meeting with Ministers, MLAs and TPCC president Mahesh Goud, the Chief Minister said that the Congress was well placed to secure a majority in the hung bodies and assessed that the party could win around 20 municipalities and corporations through coordinated political efforts and dialogue with like-minded parties and Independents.
The Chief Minister also gave specific instructions regarding the Kothagudem Municipal Corporation, where the Congress and its ally Communist Party of India (CPI) won 22 seats each, resulting in a deadlock. He gave the responsibility to Revenue Minister Ponguleti Srinivas Reddy to resolve the issue amicably and ensure the formation of a stable council.
Similarly, Mahesh Goud and N. Uttam Kumar Reddy will be the in-charge for Nizamabad Corporation; Ministers Sridhar Babu and Ponnam Prabhakar for Karimnagar Corporation to discuss with the MIM and Independents to form the Council. In Jagityal, where Congress rebels under T. Jeevan Reddy have become crucial, Minister Adluri Laxman Kumar and AICC secretary Sawant were entrusted with the responsibilty.
During the meeting, Mr. Reddy congratulated all Ministers for the Congress’s strong performance in the municipal elections and said the positive results were possible only because everyone worked collectively with discipline and coordination. He also lauded Congress party workers for their tireless efforts and commitment to the party’s victory.
The Chief Minister remarked that the Congress government had achieved in two years what the previous government failed to do in 10 years. The development works undertaken and welfare schemes implemented during this period had strengthened public faith in governance, and the civic poll results were clear evidence of that trust, he said.
Calling upon Ministers to preserve and build on this confidence, he urged them to take the State further along the development path. He advised that all future elections should be approached with the same spirit and unity that marked the recent municipal polls.
The Chief Minister also stressed the need to continuously take government welfare and development programmes to the people and ensure effective outreach. He made it clear that the government’s goal was to transform Telangana’s municipalities and municipal corporations into models at the national-level.

The government will consider if examinations have to be conducted for Class I students, Minister for General Education V. Sivankutty has said.
He was speaking after inaugurating the valedictory of an anganwadi fete at Manjampara lower primary school, Vattiyurkavu, here on Saturday.
The Minister said examinations in Class I were currently a serious affair. The government was mulling whether to conduct examinations in Class I or not. Students’ mental health should not be compromised by making them fear examinations or become anxious about it. Students should learn things not only inside textbooks but also outside it.
Mr. Sivankutty said students should be allowed to play. Action was taken as soon as it came to his attention that they were being made to study during holidays. Children should enjoy the holidays even as they learn.
V.K. Prasanth, MLA, who presided over the event said those who had made fun of the Minister for ensuring timely distribution of textbooks had become objects of ridicule themselves. A comparison of schools as they were a decade ago and their situation now would show that photostats of textbooks did not have to be taken today. The government in power before the Left Democratic Front formed the government had not been able to ensure that textbooks for the next academic year were ready in time, the MLA pointed out.
Various anganwadis took part in the fete.

Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president Sunny Joseph has sought registration of criminal cases against the Devaswom Minister and the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) for the “large-scale corruption” in the conduct of the Global Ayyappa Meet. He sought a comprehensive investigation into charges of misappropriation of funds, fabrication of documents, and criminal breach of trust.
Addressing the media at the Kannur District Congress Committee office here, Mr. Joseph alleged that the audited expenditure figures of the event and the amounts claimed by the Minister and the Board did not match.
“If he has integrity, the Devaswom Minister should resign. If he believes he can escape by shifting responsibility onto someone else, he is mistaken,” Mr. Joseph said.
He alleged that a conspiracy had been hatched to siphon off funds in the name of organising the meet, and that fabricated documents had been created for the purpose. Many of the vouchers submitted were bogus and prepared to justify fraudulent claims, he alleged and sought an inquiry to identify those who created false records.
He also alleged that those involved in the Sabarimala gold theft case were still being protected, and that delays in filing the chargesheet enabled the accused to secure bail on technical grounds.

--------------------
The SNDP Samrakshana Samiti will initiate both criminal and civil proceedings against Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam general secretary Vellappally Natesan for preparing a fraudulent voters’ list in violation of High Court directives for the upcoming organisational elections, said the samiti leaders at a press conference here on Saturday. They also alleged that Mr. Natesan and his son are spreading misinformation regarding court orders to manipulate the  elections.
The controversy stems from a High Court judgment dated December 19, 2025, which instructed the Union Ministry of Corporate Affairs to determine whether the SNDP Yogam operates as a Kerala Non-Trading Company or under the Union Companies Act. The court explicitly mandated that this decision be reached only after serving notices to the plaintiffs, examining their documents, and hearing their arguments.
However, the samiti leaders claimed that they have yet to receive a formal date for a hearing and they pointed out significant clerical discrepancies in the notices they did receive. “While the Ministry of Corporate Affairs has not yet heard the arguments or passed a final verdict, Vellappally Natesan and his son are falsely claiming to have received all necessary approvals to conduct the elections,” they said.
According to the samiti, a fraudulent circular has been issued to union officials to begin the preparation of the voters’ list. “This action reportedly ignores a standing High Court order from August 8, 2024, which appointed a specific committee to regularise the SNDP Yogam membership register using valid identity proof,” they added.
The samiti members further alleged that this violation of the law is being committed with the silent support of Central and State authorities. “The State core committee of the SNDP Samrakshana Samiti has resolved to pursue rigorous legal and organisational countermeasures. A Special Leave Petition (SLP) has been filed in the Supreme Court challenging the appeal that granted voting rights in a previous case,” they said.
The press conference was attended by chairperson S. Chandrasenan, plaintiff V. Vijayakumar, and State committee member D. Sajeev Babu.

The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) Mysuru, through its CSR and DEI Panel, successfully organised the second edition of ‘Inspiring Women to Live Fulfilling Lives’ – 2026 at the Infosys Campus in Mysuru. The symposium organised here recently witnessed participation from over 200 delegates representing the IT sector, academia, healthcare institutions, and diverse industries.
Ms. Trishikha Kumari Wadiyar, chairperson, Bherunda Foundation, joined the symposium through a virtual presence and addressed the gathering, encouraging women to pursue holistic growth and a purposeful life.
The programme was structured around four core themes — Financial Well-being, Mental Well-being, Physical Well-being, and Emotional Well-being — offering practical insights aligned to both personal and professional excellence, according to a CII press release.
Ms. Savitha Mallappa, convenor, CII Mysuru CSR and DEI Panel, said, “This symposium was curated to move beyond dialogue and provide actionable frameworks on well-being and inclusion. When organisations consciously invest in financial awareness, mental resilience, physical health, and emotional strength, they build stronger and more sustainable workplaces.”
Mr. Nagaraja Gargeshwari, chairman, CII Mysuru Zone, said, “Inclusive growth and industrial competitiveness go hand in hand. As Mysuru continues to evolve as a knowledge and industry hub, it is essential that organisations create ecosystems where women can participate, progress, and lead with confidence. Such platforms convert intent into structured industry action.”
The symposium featured experienced panellists from diverse backgrounds who shared insights and best practices on financial independence, mental health awareness, preventive healthcare, and organisational health frameworks. The discussions emphasised the importance of breaking stigma, enabling open conversations and creating supportive environments that help women lead fulfilling personal and professional lives, the release stated.
This second edition also marked the launch of a Women Return-to-Work platform, aimed at connecting women aspiring to re-enter the workforce after a career break with industry partners, and enabling engagement in a phased approach. The symposium concluded with participant reflections and a strong appreciation for the depth of discussions, expert-led sessions, and the spirit of cross-sector collaboration.

The mega convention at Haveri on Saturday to launch “Bhoo Guarantee”, that coincided with the Congress government completing 1,000 days in office, also became a platform for raising the issue of “injustice” meted out to Karnataka by the Centre.
Addressing a gathering of beneficiaries who were issued title deeds of properties, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah questioned the silence of the former Chief Ministers, who are now MPs, on the issue of “injustice”.
“Former Chief Ministers and incumbent MPs Basavaraj Bommai and Jagadish Shettar and Union Minister Pralhad Joshi are not opening their mouths to speak on the injustice to Karnataka,” he said.
“We have created a record by distributing title deeds to a total of 2.2 lakh beneficiary families, even as we have become number one in GDP. These have been achieved despite the injustice by the Centre in terms of release of funds,” he said.
Describing the title deed distribution as the “sixth guarantee”, he said that if what was due for the State was given by the Centre, the government would be able to initiate more development works.
Mr. Siddaramaiah claimed that in the last two years and nine months, the State government had fulfilled 243 assurances. “But the BJP which did not fulfil its assurances when in power, is now spreading canards about the exchequer being empty. So far we have directly credited ₹1,18,000 crore to bank accounts of people of the State through various guarantees,” he said.

A consultative meeting of the ‘satyagrahis’ of the Badanavalu Satyagraha was held at the Indian Institute of Educational Theatre here on Saturday.
The Badanavalu Satyagraha primarily focused on issues such as excessive use of vehicles, extravagant programmes, and commercialisation, eventually taking the form of a movement. However, since the situation has not changed even today, theatre personality Prasanna emphasised that it is important to deliberate on how to carry this satyagraha forward. Hence, the meeting was organised.
Speaking on the occasion, Jayadev expressed the view that “The Village Satyagraha must continue as a non-violent movement.”
Recently, the government has sanctioned ₹40 crore for the development of the Badanavalu Nanjangud Khadi Centre. The participants expressed that the government seems to consider the mere construction of buildings as development. “By centring activities around the Badanavalu Khadi Centre and promoting the sale of khadi products, it is possible to encourage rural cottage industries and provide employment to rural women within their own villages. The Khadi Centre has gained special significance because Mahatma Gandhi had visited Badanaval. There is a need to realise the dream of sustainable living that upholds the values of village life,” the organisers said in a note.
At the meeting, there was also a discussion on renaming the Badanavalu Satyagraha as ‘Grama Satyagraha’. Participants shared their views at length.
The meeting was attended by personalities who follow Gandhian principles, including Prasanna, Jayadev and Yatiraj from Tumakuru, Venkataraju from Chamarajanagar, Punajuru Doreswamy, A.D. Silva, Tagadur Mohan, Badanavalu Mahadevappa, Umashankar and Pavitra Muddayya from Bengaluru, Lavanya and Abhilash from Grama Seva Sangha, writer G.P. Basavaraju, journalist Rashmi Koti, and farmer Karunakara.
Prasanna read out the draft resolution at the meeting, and all the participants expressed their consent to it. The historic Badanavalu Satyagraha of 2015 had passed several resolutions concerning a sustainable lifestyle and the economy. “Today, we have become more unsustainable than ever. The village economy is getting destroyed. Cities and machine-made cultures have grown to monstrous proportions, thus pushing humanity to the brink of extinction,” the resolution stated.
“We resolve to rename Badanavalu Satyagraha as Gram Satyagraha and lead it towards the rejuvenation of the villages, the hand-made economy, natural farming, local culture, mother tongue, protection of deprived sections of the society, and for the protection of damaged natural resources. We shall lead a non-violent and constructive movement in the name of Gram Satyagraha,” the resolution added.

The State government is implementing development projects by giving equal importance to traditional sectors and agriculture alongside modern industries, Finance Minister K.N. Balagopal said here on Saturday.  He was speaking after inaugurating a development seminar for Neduvathur grama panchayat’s 2026-27 People’s Plan campaign.
Highlighting the local progress, the Minister observed that Neduvathur has evolved into a major development hub for the Kottarakara region. He pointed out that the establishment of the Zoho IT Park in Neduvathur has significantly contributed to an increase in professional tax revenue for the local body.
“To safeguard employment within traditional sectors, specialised vocational training programmes have been implemented in unnathis. Authorised youth clubs will receive an annual financial assistance of ₹10,000 to support their activities,” he said.
Addressing the grievances of the farming community, Mr. Balagopal also assured that effective solutions would be found to mitigate the recurring instances of human-wildlife conflict.
Providing updates on some key infrastructure projects in the region, the Minister said that the construction of the Kottarakara Ayurveda Hospital, one of Kerala’s two integrated AYUSH hospitals, is moving forward steadily. “Funds have already been sanctioned for building modern markets in Veliyam and Mylam panchayats, while similar market construction projects are currently under way in Ezhukone and Kalayapuram. Also, the development of the Panayil-Paramukku road, being built at a cost of ₹3.75 crore, will be fast-tracked for completion,” he said.
The seminar was presided over by Neduvathur grama panchayat president V. Vidya, while standing committee chairperson K.S. Amrita presented the draft plan.

He said the government aimed to provide better roads to the people.
He said ₹1,280 crore was allocated for investments and infrastructure development and added that with improved infrastructure, investors’ confidence in the government had increased.
“Though Andhra Pradesh does not even account for 25% of the country’s population, it has secured 25% of the nation’s investments and it is a testament to the Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu’s efforts,” he said.
Claiming that the budget reflects a balance, combining development and welfare measures, he cited allocation of ₹91,000 crore for welfare schemes for the underprivileged and ₹30,000 crore for developing Rayalaseema as a global horticulture hub.

TITLE: Budget takes balanced approach to welfare, development: CII-AP

--------------------
The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII-Andhra Pradesh) praised the Budget presented by Minister for Finance   Payyavula Keshav in the Assembly on Saturday (February 14), saying that it took a balanced approach to fulfilling welfare commitments and long-term development priorities.
CII-A.P. chairperson Murali Krishna Gannamani said in a press release that the Budget created a positive ecosystem for industry through infrastructure development and by strengthening logistics and planning regional economic clusters.
He expressed confidence that the allocation of ₹28,000 crore for Visakhapatnam Economic Region would transform north Andhra into a major industrial, IT, maritime and services growth hub.
Vice-chairperson S. Narendra Kumar said the Budget attempted to strike a balance between the development of Amaravati and large-scale welfare spending, positioning both as parallel growth drivers for the State. Capital expenditure was being used as an investment multiplier to attract private investment, services sector growth and employment generation, he noted.
CII-Vijayawada chairperson V. Nagalakshmi hailed the allocation of ₹19,306 crore for the health sector and observed that healthcare should be a major component of the State’s welfare and human development strategy.
CII-AP former chairperson D. Ramakrishna said school education getting a major chunk of the budget (₹32,308 crore) reflected the government’s intent on strengthening the human capital. The substantial allocations for scholarships and skill development were a step in the right direction, he said.
M. Lakshmi Prasad, former chairperson of CII-A.P., said the Budget has linked agricultural growth directly with rural prosperity and economic stability, and the provision of ₹20,000 each in annual assistance to 46.86 lakh farmers would strengthen farm income security, thereby help reduce farmer distress.

TITLE: On Quad Summit, Jaishankar Says ‘Stay Tuned,’ Insists It Was ‘Never’ Cancelled
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/stay-tuned-jaishankar-on-quad-summit-status-says-it-was-never-cancelled-ws-l-9904185.html
--------------------
In his first remarks on the Quad Summit following the India-US trade deal developments, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Saturday clarified that the Quad summit was “never cancelled," pushing back against speculation about the grouping’s trajectory.
While speaking at the Munich Security Conference 2026, where he participated in a roundtable discussion titled ‘Delhi Decides: Mapping India’s Policy Calculus’ hosted by Ananta Aspen, Jaishankar addressed questions regarding the Quad saying that the summit was never cancelled, however it was never specifically scheduled.
“The Quad summit was never cancelled. It was never specifically scheduled. Yes, it did not take place — but I won’t over read ‘Quad’ not happening at a summit level," he said.
Jaishankar further emphasised continued engagement within the group and highlighted that his first meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio took place in the Quad Foreign Ministers’ Meeting (FMM) format.
“We had two Quad FMMs. Other mechanisms are going on," he said, underlining that cooperation among the four countries remains active through multiple channels.
Downplaying concerns over the absence of a leaders’ summit, the Union Minister signaled continuity rather than disruption in Quad engagements.
The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, comprising India, the United States, Japan and Australia, has been central to Indo-Pacific cooperation on maritime security, supply chains, critical technologies and regional stability.
Jaishankar’s remarks are significant as they mark his first public statement on the QUAD following recent trade deal announcement.
Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump announced that the United States and India have reached a trade deal to lower reciprocal tariffs. He said that following a phone call with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the US would reduce tariffs on Indian goods from 25 per cent to 18 per cent with immediate effect. In return, Trump claimed India would cut its tariffs and non-tariff barriers on US products to “zero."
As part of the understanding, India has signalled plans to increase its purchases of US products in areas such as energy, aircraft parts, machinery and technology, with an overall trade engagement target of around $500 billion over the next few years. Both sides also agreed to work on reducing trade barriers and improving cooperation on areas like digital trade and supply chains.
Later, the White House replaced its original fact sheet on the interim trade framework with a revised version. A reference to “certain pulses" being included in tariff reductions has been removed, ensuring that India’s longstanding tariff protections for its farmers remain intact. Similarly, wording that said India had “committed to buy" $500 billion worth of US goods has been replaced with “intends to buy," making it clear that these purchases are not legally binding obligations but part of a broader intent outlined in the joint statement.
Further, agriculture has been removed from the list of sectors from which India would purchase US goods, limiting perceived exposure of the farm sector. The earlier line stating that India would remove its digital services tax has also been deleted. Instead, the updated version says India has “committed to negotiate a robust set of bilateral digital trade rules," shifting the focus from unilateral concessions to future negotiations.

TITLE: PM RAHAT: Who Is Eligible And How The Cashless Road Accident Scheme Works?
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/pm-rahat-who-is-eligible-and-how-the-cashless-road-accident-scheme-works-ws-el-9904184.html
--------------------
The government has rolled out PM RAHAT (Road Accident Victim Hospitalisation and Assured Treatment), a nationwide scheme designed to provide cashless medical care to road accident victims and ensure that financial constraints do not delay life-saving treatment.
The initiative aims to strengthen India’s emergency response system by guaranteeing immediate medical support during the critical “Golden Hour" — the first hour after an accident, when timely intervention can significantly improve survival chances.
Under PM RAHAT, every eligible road accident victim will be entitled to cashless treatment of up to ₹1.5 lakh for a period of seven days from the date of the accident, regardless of the category of road on which the incident occurred.
In non-life-threatening cases, stabilisation treatment will be provided for up to 24 hours. In life-threatening cases, it can extend up to 48 hours, subject to verification through an integrated digital system.
The scheme is integrated with the Emergency Response Support System (ERSS) 112. Accident victims, Good Samaritans (Rah-Veer), or anyone present at the scene can dial 112 to receive information about the nearest designated hospital and request ambulance assistance.
This linkage is expected to improve coordination between emergency responders, police authorities and hospitals, helping victims reach medical facilities more quickly.
Hospitals will be reimbursed through the Motor Vehicle Accident Fund (MVAF).
If the offending vehicle is insured, the payment will come from contributions made by general insurance companies. In cases involving uninsured vehicles or hit-and-run incidents, the government will cover the costs through budgetary allocations.
Approved claims will be settled within 10 days by the State Health Agency, providing financial assurance to hospitals and encouraging uninterrupted treatment.
The scheme operates on a digital platform that integrates the Electronic Detailed Accident Report (eDAR) system of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways with the National Health Authority’s Transaction Management System (TMS 2.0).
This ensures seamless digital tracking from accident reporting and police authentication to treatment delivery, claim processing and payment.
Each district will have a designated Grievance Redressal Officer, nominated by the District Road Safety Committee, which is chaired by the District Collector or an equivalent authority, to address complaints and ensure accountability.
India records a significant number of road accident deaths every year, many of which could be prevented with timely medical intervention. Studies indicate that nearly half of such fatalities can be avoided if victims receive hospital care within the Golden Hour.
By removing upfront payment barriers and ensuring faster emergency coordination, PM RAHAT seeks to reduce preventable deaths and strengthen the country’s emergency healthcare ecosystem.
In essence, the scheme ensures that accident victims receive immediate treatment without worrying about costs, a step aimed at saving lives and improving road safety outcomes nationwide.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday inaugurated the Kumar Bhaskar Varma Setu, a major bridge project across the Brahmaputra River, describing it as a vital infrastructure development for Guwahati and the surrounding areas.
Kumar Bhaskar Varma Setu across the Brahmaputra is a vital infrastructure project for Guwahati and areas around it. Connectivity, comfort and commerce will be significantly enhanced. It will enable devotees to go to the Kamakhya Temple with greater ease. pic.twitter.com/bdpjbW0oNk— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) February 14, 2026
Sharing images from the site, the Prime Minister said the bridge would significantly enhance connectivity, comfort and commerce in Assam. He also noted that the project would make it easier for devotees to visit the revered Kamakhya Temple in Guwahati.
The Kumar Bhaskar Varma Setu is a key bridge constructed over the Brahmaputra, one of India’s largest rivers, aimed at easing traffic congestion and strengthening transport links in Assam’s largest city.
Named after the ancient Kamarupa king Kumar Bhaskar Varma, the bridge is designed to serve as an additional crossing over the Brahmaputra, supplementing existing bridges such as the Saraighat Bridge. The new structure is expected to decongest city traffic and improve travel time between north and south Guwahati, as well as nearby districts.
Improved Connectivity:
The bridge will reduce travel time across the Brahmaputra and ease pressure on existing crossings, which often face heavy traffic.
Boost to Commerce:
Better road connectivity is expected to enhance trade and logistics in the region, facilitating smoother movement of goods and services across Assam and the Northeast.
Religious Tourism:
With Kamakhya Temple being one of the most prominent pilgrimage sites in the country, improved access is likely to benefit thousands of devotees who travel to Guwahati each year.
Urban Expansion:
The new crossing is also expected to support urban development by opening up better connectivity to residential and commercial hubs on both sides of the river.
The project forms part of a broader push to strengthen infrastructure in the Northeast, aimed at improving economic integration and regional development.
Officials say the bridge will play a key role in shaping Guwahati’s future growth while easing daily commuting challenges for residents.

--------------------
The Andhra Pradesh government on Saturday presented a Budget of Rs 3,32,205 crore for the financial year 2026-27, positioning it as a roadmap aimed at balancing welfare commitments with long-term economic growth and infrastructure development.
Finance Minister Payyavula Keshav tabled the Budget in the State Assembly, marking the third consecutive time he has presented the state’s financial statement, including one Vote-on-Account and two full-fledged budgets.

--------------------
A controversy erupted in Maharashtra’s Yavatmal district after students of a government-run Urdu school were allegedly made to perform to a Pakistani military song during a cultural programme, leading to police action against the school administration.
According to multiple media reports, an FIR was registered against the headmaster and a teacher of Abdul Gafur Shah Municipal Urdu School No. 2 in Umarkhed town following a complaint over the performance held as part of a Republic Day-related cultural event.
Videos from the programme, which surfaced on social media and were widely circulated in local groups, show students performing a choreographed dance while holding symbolic or mock swords.
The song playing in the background was believed to be “Ae Mard-e-Mujahid Teri Yalgaar Kahan Hai," described as a Pakistani patriotic or military-motivational anthem.
Visuals seen in the viral clips show children dressed in stage costumes moving in formation, with the music played through loudspeakers and displayed on screens at the venue.
The performance appears to be part of a planned cultural presentation before an audience of parents and residents.
[News18 chose not to share the video to protect the identities of the minors].
The videos triggered sharp reactions online after users alleged that the song had historical links to Pakistan’s armed forces.
As reported by The Times of India, BJP councillor Gopal Kalane filed a complaint stating that Class 6 students were dancing with symbolic swords to the song and that the performance hurt public sentiments and could negatively influence children.
Police subsequently registered an offence under Section 196(1)(c) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, and launched an investigation.
Officials were quoted as saying that statements were being recorded and the role of school authorities in approving the programme was being examined.
Authorities were also probing how the song was selected and whether guidelines governing school functions were violated.
The school administration has not issued a detailed public statement so far.

--------------------
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said India is poised to emerge as a major driver of global growth and a foundational force in the evolving world order, highlighting the country’s economic rise, reform agenda and technology-led transformation.
Addressing the ET Now Global Business Summit 2026, PM Modi said the past decade had witnessed significant global upheavals, ranging from the pandemic to geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions, but asserted that India had turned challenges into opportunities.
“The past decade of the 21st century has been disrupting the global pandemic. There is tension and war in different parts of the globe, and supply chain breakdowns are shaking the balance of the globe. The world has seen a lot in the past decade," he said.
He added that crises often reveal a nation’s true potential and said India had demonstrated resilience during this period.
“I am very proud that in the midst of many disruptions, this decade has been a time of unprecedented development for India. It has been a time of great delivery and a time of strengthening democracy," the Prime Minister said.
INDIA’S ECONOMIC RISE AND GLOBAL ROLE
Recalling India’s economic position a decade ago, PM Modi said the country had moved steadily upward despite doubts about its trajectory.
“When the last decade began, India was the 11th-largest economy. But today, India is rapidly becoming the third-largest economy in the world," he said.
He stressed that India would play a defining role in shaping global growth in the coming decades.
“The century of change you are talking about, India is going to be a great foundation for it. India will drive the growth of the world. It will become a new engine for the growth of the world," he said.
The Prime Minister noted India currently contributes more than 16 per cent to global growth and expressed confidence that this contribution would continue to increase.
NEW WORLD ORDER AND RESILIENCE
PM Modi said the global order formed after the Second World War was transforming, as earlier assumptions about stable supply chains and uniform development models were breaking down.
“The world is moving towards a new world order," he said, adding that the earlier system was based on a “one size fits all" approach that is now losing relevance.
He said nations are increasingly focusing on building resilience, adding that India had adopted this vision early through the founding principles of NITI Aayog.
FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS AND POLICY SHIFT
The Prime Minister said India’s free trade agreements were now widely discussed internationally, attributing the change to improved governance and clarity in policy.
“There’s a lot of discussion these days about India’s FTAs. We are able to sign these trade deals because today’s India is full of self-confidence and ready to compete with the world," he said.
He said earlier policy uncertainty and governance challenges had weakened global confidence, but reforms had changed perceptions about India.
REFORMS, TECHNOLOGY AND GOVERNANCE
Highlighting reforms, PM Modi said his government had shifted policymaking towards outcomes rather than mere expenditure.
He described India as riding a “Reform Express," with technology and innovation serving as core drivers of growth. He cited the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) as a key example of reforms driven by conviction.
“It’s not just an app; it’s a testament to the remarkable convergence of policy, process, and delivery," he said, adding that digital reforms had expanded financial inclusion.
The Prime Minister also highlighted increased capital expenditure, infrastructure investments and initiatives such as university townships, economic regions and high-speed rail corridors as steps aimed at strengthening productivity and employment.
AI AND FUTURE PREPAREDNESS
PM Modi underlined that artificial intelligence would bring transformative disruptions globally and said India was preparing itself for that future.
Referring to the upcoming Global AI Impact Summit to be hosted in India, he said the gathering of world leaders and technology experts would help advance efforts toward building a better world.
Reaffirming the government’s long-term vision, PM Modi said India’s policies were guided by the goal of becoming a developed nation by 2047, stressing that decisions taken today were aimed at securing the future of coming generations.

The U.K.'s focus during the AI Impact Summit set to start in New Delhi on Monday (February 16, 2026) will be on championing how artificial intelligence can supercharge growth, unlock new jobs, improve public services and deliver benefits for people around the globe, the British government has said.
The U.K. delegation, led by Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy and AI Minister Kanishka Narayan, is keen to highlight how AI can improve everyday life in every corner of the world and make the case for AI as an engine of renewal that can help doctors diagnose faster, teachers personalise learning, councils deliver services in minutes and businesses create the next generation of good jobs.
"This summit is an important moment in determining how we can work together with our international partners to unlock the full benefits and potential of AI, while baking in robust and fair safety standards that protect us all," said Mr. Lammy, in a pre-summit statement.
The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) said India and Britain were "natural tech partners", with software giants like Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Wipro expanding their operations across the U.K.
"AI is the defining technology of our generation, and we're determined to make sure it delivers for everyone," said Mr. Narayan, the first Indian-origin MP from Wales.
"It can cut waiting times, transform public services, create new jobs and give hard-working communities a fresh start – and that's exactly the message we're taking to the summit. It is central to our plans for delivering national renewal, but its benefits can't and shouldn't be reserved by the few," he said.
The AI minister said the U.K. is "leading from the front, pushing a global vision for AI that helps people everywhere to learn more, earn more, and shape the future on their terms".
"We are totally aligned in making sure that the people of Britain and the people of India get to not just look at AI being built by others but build AI and benefit from AI directly," he said.
Besides Delhi, Mr. Narayan will also travel to Bengaluru to explore how India and the U.K. are working together to reap the benefits of breakthrough tech.
Both countries are investing tens of millions in cutting-edge research — from better batteries and next-generation telecoms for rural communities, to genomic medicine that could tackle rare diseases, the DSIT said.
India is also a vitally important market for British businesses generally, with U.K. firms generating more than 47.5 billion pounds in revenue from their business in India, it stated.
During the AI Impact Summit this week, the U.K. is expected to announce new support for an African Language Hub, enabling AI to work in 40 African languages with the aim of making the technology more inclusive and accessible for millions.
This will be one of three new initiatives being announced as part of the more than 100 million pounds AI for Development (AI4D) programme, created to ensure that developing countries benefit fully from the AI revolution.

The Asian AI4D Observatory will be geared towards supporting responsible AI innovation and governance across South and Southeast Asia, and the AI4D Compute Hub at the University of Cape Town will give African innovators the compute power they need to turn ideas into impact.
The AI Impact Summit in New Delhi has been described as the first international artificial intelligence gathering of its kind to be held in the Global South, anchored around three Sutras of people, planet and progress as India's approach to cooperation in the field.

The Union Government has approved road projects worth more than ₹11,000 crore in Maharashtra, Telangana and Gujarat, according to official statements.
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) on Friday approved the rehabilitation and upgradation of the Ghoti-Trimbak (Mokhada)-Jawhar-Manor-Palghar section of NH-160A in Maharashtra at a total capital cost of ₹3,320.38 crore.
The region west of Nashik, particularly around Ambad and Satpur, hosts a dense cluster of industrial units developed by the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation. This generates significant freight traffic, the Ministry of Road, Transport and Highways (MoRTH) said in a statement on Saturday (February 14, 2026).
The CCEA approved the rehabilitation and upgradation of the 154.635 km section of NH-160A in Maharashtra in Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) mode, MoRTH said.
The project has been proposed in line with the PM GatiShakti principles and will connect six PM GatiShakti Economic Nodes, one Social Node and eight Logistics Nodes in Maharashtra. This will have a positive impact on the Logistic Performance Index (LPI) of the country.
In a separate release, MoRTH said that the CCEA also approved construction of 4-lane sections of Dhamasiya-Bitada/Movi and Nasarpore-Malotha in Gujarat at ₹4,583.64 crore.
The 107.67-km-long project is a part of NH-56, which starts at Nimbahera in Rajasthan and traverses through Dahod district in Gujarat, Alirajpur district in Madhya Pradesh and then re-enters Gujarat near Chhota Udepur district, terminating at its junction with NH-48 near Vapi.
The project is designed for 100 km/h, enabling a 70 km/h average speed, which will cut travel time by 40% — from 2.5 to 1.5 hours.
The CCEA also approved the widening of National Highway-167 with a total capital cost of ₹3,175.08 crore in Telangana, MoRTH said in a separate release.
The project from Gudebellur to Mahabubnagar on the Hyderabad-Panaji Economic Corridor to 4-Lane Standard in Telangana with a total project length of 80.01 km and total capital cost of ₹3175.08 crore will be executed in hybrid annuity mode (HAM) under the NH (O) scheme [National Highways (Original)].
To address these challenges, the project is proposed to be developed as a 4-lane standard. The project will provide significant benefit to the Narayanpet and Mahabubnagar districts in Telangana.

Fiscal prudence never seems to take precedence during elections in India. Last week, this was demonstrated yet again in Tamil Nadu when Chief Minister M.K. Stalin surprised 1.31 crore women covered under the Kalaignar Magalir Urimai Thogai (KMUT) — a universal basic income scheme for poor women — by transferring ₹5,000 to each of them.
The amount included ₹1,000 each for the months of February, March, and April, along with a ‘special summer assistance’ of ₹2,000. The ‘special summer assistance’, the first of its kind in the State, drew appreciation from the allies of the DMK and criticism from the Opposition. Mr. Stalin also said that in the event that his party retained power in the Assembly elections, likely to be held in April, the government would increase the monthly amount to ₹2,000.
At one stroke, the Tamil Nadu government incurred an expenditure of ₹6,550 crore. Mr. Stalin’s move comes at a time when the DMK has been accusing the Centre of being biased against Tamil Nadu in releasing funds. At a meeting in New Delhi last month, Finance Minister Thangam Thennarasu told the Centre that ₹3,548 crore due under the Samagra Shiksha scheme for 2024-25 and 2025-26 had not been released. He also expressed concern that rate rationalisation of the Goods and Services Tax would lead to a revenue loss of ₹10,000 crore to the State this year.

The pre-poll bonanza is not new in Tamil Nadu or in other States. On this score, no party in India is different from the other. During the Interim Budget for 2019-20, the BJP-led Central government announced ₹6,000 a year to farmers under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi. The scheme has no link to the performance of agriculturists. It came into being in February 2019, just about two months before polling began for the Lok Sabha elections.
In June 2024, after securing only 17 out of 48 seats in the Lok Sabha elections in Maharashtra, the Mahayuti government in the State rolled out a women-centric scheme. It was modelled along the lines of Madhya Pradesh’s Ladli Behna Yojana, which played a major role in tilting the scales in favour of the BJP during the 2023 Assembly elections. Apart from announcing that it would increase assistance under the Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana eventually from ₹1,500 to ₹2,100, the Maharashtra government released two installments at one go before the State went to polls in November 2024. The Mahayuti won the elections.
Last year, before the Assembly elections in Bihar, the Prime Minister launched the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana, an employment scheme. The government transferred ₹10,000 each to 75 lakh women. The NDA comprising the JD(U) and the BJP was given one more term.
In mid-January 2026, AIADMK general secretary Edappadi K. Palaniswami released the party’s first set of guarantees for the Assembly elections. He assured the electorate that the AIADMK, if elected to power, would expand the monthly assistance scheme for women. He promised to provide ₹2,000 per month to the woman head of every ration card-holding family.
In defence of his government’s latest move, Mr. Stalin contended that it had “thwarted the attempts of the BJP” to halt the distribution of monthly assistance under the KMUT scheme before the Assembly elections. Mr. Palaniswami accused the Chief Minister of suffering from the “fear” of losing elections after having made the State “insecure” for “girls, women, and senior citizens.” He has consistently alleged that the DMK regime broke its promise of universal coverage for the women’s cash assistance scheme.
The culture of freebies or ‘welfare schemes’ is deeply entrenched in the Indian political system. There seems to be no end to the launch of these schemes, whether in Tamil Nadu or other States. This is despite the fact that the efficacy of these schemes varies from one State to another, even in terms of electoral gains. What is required is not the proliferation of welfare schemes, but their efficient and targeted administration for a defined period. They cannot be entitlements without measurable outcomes or fiscal discipline. It would only be fair to expect Tamil Nadu — a State that has consistently been at the forefront of governance — to pave the way for a regime committed to this principle.

--------------------
GURUGRAM:
In a push to strengthen food and drug safety systems, the Haryana Government has approved ₹53.21 crore for upgrading regulatory infrastructure in the National Capital Region, including the deployment of 28 mobile food testing laboratory (MFTL) vans and modernisation of the District Food Laboratory at Karnal.
Sharing the details, Additional Chief Secretary, Health and Family Welfare Department, Sumita Misra said the initiative marks a step towards ensuring faster, scientific and accessible food testing services for citizens.
Five MFTL vans provided by Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) are already operational across districts, offering on-the-spot food testing at a nominal ₹20 per sample. The addition of 28 new vans in NCR areas will significantly expand outreach and citizen access.
Haryana currently has two notified food testing laboratories at Chandigarh and Karnal both NABL-accredited and recognised by FSSAI under Section 43(1) of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. Recognising that milk and dairy products form a major component of the State’s diet — and that Haryana is a leading hub for sportspersons - Ms. Misra said eight state-of-the-art food testing laboratories will be established in phases to ensure high-quality food standards across the State.
Ms. Misra further informed that to promote a hygienic street food culture, four cities namely Ambala, Karnal, Hisar and Gurugram  have been selected for Clean Street Food Hubs. In Ambala, a 60-shop Street Food Hub is being developed at Gandhi Ground, Ambala Cantt, and is expected to be completed by February 2026.
Hisar has completed around 60% of the work and aims to finish the project by the end of the current financial year. In Karnal, land near the Western Yamuna Canal at Vishwakarma Chowk has been identified and the Detailed Project Report approved, with completion targeted for 2026–27. In Gurugram, the project is at the tendering stage.

Kerala Tourism’s decade-old project to renovate the 11 Chinese fishing nets that adorn the Fort Kochi beachfront remains far from completion.
With barely six months left for the tourist season to begin, concerns are mounting that visitors may once again miss the opportunity to see the iconic nets in operation. Stakeholders fear that the continued uncertainty over replacing the wooden logs, nets and other components could sound the death knell for the ₹2.40-crore project, which was expected to give Fort Kochi an image makeover.
Expressing concern over the prolonged delay, a net operator said the project could have been completed at least two years ago but for bureaucratic red tape that held up the payment of just over ₹5 lakh to a team of workers who undertook preparatory renovation work under challenging conditions.
Sebastian Kurishinkal, president of the Fort Kochi Chinese Net Owners’ Association, said he hoped Kerala Tourism, which is funding the initiative, and KITCO, the implementing agency, would expedite fund disbursal and the procurement of nets and allied materials. “Otherwise, the long forest teak logs and other wooden materials stacked near the beach may get damaged. The nets readied by Matsyafed over a year ago also face similar risks,” he said.
The delay has also affected the livelihood of more than 100 fishermen who operate the nets, each of which requires 12 fishermen working in two shifts. “We hope the necessary funds are released and materials procured at least this month, as the model code of conduct for the Assembly elections, which is expected soon, could further delay the process,” he added.
Responding to the concerns, sources in Kerala Tourism said the delay occurred because administrative sanction for the project had to be reissued in December 2025. “This required fresh agreements to be signed. Steps are now being taken to hand over the nets to the operators and renovate the platforms from which the fishermen work,” the sources said.
Amid uncertainty over the renovation, most operators have replaced the damaged teak logs supporting the nets with iron pipes, affecting the traditional aesthetics of the Chinese fishing nets.

Debris of a launch vehicle with the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) logo and the national emblem have reportedly been found recently in an uninhabited island in Maldives.
The debris of the Payload Fairing which are believed to be that of ISRO’s Launch Vehicle Mark-3 (LVM-3) washed up to an island near L. Kunahandhoo in Maldives, and found on February 12. Local Maldivian media have also reported on parts of the debris washing up to the shore.
The debris are said to have fallen on an uninhabited island and there has been no damage caused to any human life or property due to their impact.
indianspaceflight.in., a website which tracks Indian spaceflight and aerospace developments, in a post on X said the debris were likely from the LVM3-M6 mission.
“A PLF (Payload Fairing) has washed up on an uninhabited island near L. Kunahandhoo, #maldives (found February 12, 2026). The @isro logo’s position below the national emblem suggests it is likely from the LVM3-M6 launch. This follows a similar recovery on December 28, 2025, in Sri Lanka (Trincomalee), which also appeared to be from the same mission.  #ISRO #LVM3M6 #LVM,” @ispaceflight_in posted on X.

On December 19, 2025 ISRO launched the LVM3-M6 / BlueBird Block-2 Mission, a dedicated commercial mission onboard the LVM3 launch vehicle. During the mission, it successfully launched the BlueBird Block-2 communication satellite of AST SpaceMobile, U.S.A. and on November 2 the space agency used the LVM-3 to launch the CMS-03 communication satellite.
LVM3 is the heaviest rocket developed by ISRO and is a three-stage launch vehicle comprising two solid strap-on motors, a liquid core stage and a cryogenic upper stage .
ISRO is yet to confirm whether the debris are from an Indian launch vehicle.

India recently entered into a spate of trade agreements, including with the European Union and the United States, “from a position of strength”, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday (February 15, 2026), adding that these deals were designed to expand global market access for Indian manufacturing and services.
His remarks, made in a written interview to the Press Trust of India, comes after the first part of the Budget Session of Parliament, where the government faced an attack by the Opposition on the terms of the trade deals.
Mr. Modi defended the agreements, noting that while long negotiations by the previous Congress-led UPA government had not yielded any results, his government’s “political stability and political predictability” had restored investors’ confidence in India.
The Prime Minister spoke at length about his own government’s efforts to enable the environment to strike these deals as well as his expectations from the private sector in taking advantage of these agreements.
“Trade competitiveness is not only about tariffs. It is about liquidity, certification, technology adoption and compliance with global standards. Our Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) are designed to reduce non-tariff barriers and expand market access for Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in sectors such as textiles, leather, processed food, engineering goods, chemicals, handicrafts and gems and jewellery,” Mr. Modi said.
“Indian MSMEs are more export-ready than before, and India’s trade policy now deliberately places MSMEs at the centre of global integration. These FTAs are tools to ensure that our youth are not just suppliers to the domestic market, but active participants in global trade and growth,” he said.
But, he added, “policy can only create the enabling framework. The next phase of transformation requires a decisive response from the private sector.”

“As a country that is part of various trade agreements, making Indian products and services globally competitive is crucial. Our stance on ‘Zero Defect, Zero Effect’ has resonated deeply with the youth, start-ups and small and medium businesses,” the Prime Minister said. “MSMEs must move beyond being peripheral suppliers. They must become technologically upgraded, globally integrated and export-oriented enterprises that form the backbone of India’s participation in global value chains,” he added.
Comment | India tested, from U.S. sanctions to one-sided trade deal
Mr. Modi explained the long-term approach behind the Union Budget for 2026-2027. “This is not a ‘now or never’ moment born out of compulsion. It is a ‘we are ready’ moment born out of preparation and inspiration. This Budget reflects this yearning to become a developed nation,” he said, explaining the Budget’s boost for capital expenditure.
He added that it was now time for the private sector to step up and take advantage of the government’s investment in infrastructure and capital expenditure. “I am proud to say that we have moved from incremental adjustments to systemic transformation,” he said.
His government’s top three reform priorities for the next decade, Mr. Modi said, would be continued structural reforms, deepening innovation, and further simplification of governance.
On defence expenditure and reforms, he noted that his government’s focus on the issue had visibly paid off during the course of Operation Sindoor against Pakistan.
“During the operation, one could see the benefits of the reforms we have undertaken in the last decade. Therefore, defence budgets, modernisation, etc., all these are parts of our continuous effort and need not be linked to any particular issue,” he said in the written interview.
When asked whether the higher budgetary allocation to the defence sector was part of the lesson learnt from Operation Sindoor, he answered in the affirmative. “Yes, the reality is that our country has to be strong and be prepared at all times, and that is what we are doing,” the Prime Minister said.
Union Budget 2026: Defence gets record ₹7.85 lakh crore Budget boost post-Operation Sindoor
“In this year’s budget, a record ₹7.85 lakh crore have been allocated to the defence sector. This is 15 per cent higher than the previous budget and is also the biggest chunk allotted to any ministry or department,” he said.
Speaking on the eve of the global AI Summit to be held in New Delhi from Monday, Mr. Modi said that “tax incentives announced in the Budget are designed to accelerate investment in this space, lower the cost of building advanced facilities and position India as a globally competitive destination for data infrastructure. The result of this, too, will be a massive number of jobs for our youth. We invite the whole world’s data to reside in India!”

India continues to remain “careful” in setting its expectations on working with the incoming administration of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) but the party’s chairman, Tarique Rahman, has a development agenda that may provide an opportunity to both sides to normalise the relations, The Hindu has learnt from highly placed diplomatic sources who are aware of the plans in this regard.
The Indian side keenly watched the campaign trail of Mr. Rahman and found that his 31-point agenda has several areas such as his plans in the digital domain and infrastructure building that may help ties that had stalled in the previous 17 months because of multiple factors, including the escape of deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to India on August 5, 2024.
Mr. Rahman, who returned after more than one and half decade-long exile in the United Kingdom on December 25, 2025, was greeted by a huge crowd and subsequently the support for him and his party was seen in the funeral prayers for his mother, the former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia on December 31. However, it was his election campaign that caught attention in relevant quarters as he steered clear from playing any anti-India card. It was noticed that the anti-India card was not played directly by his opponents Jamaat-e-Islami and the National Citizen Party (NCP) but they often referred to the India factor through codes like ‘pro-hegemony forces’ in their election speeches. In contrast, Mr. Rahman stuck to his 31-point plans that had commitment to building an inclusive ‘Rainbow Nation’, and reiterated the BNP’s opposition to “terrorism, extremism and militancy”.
In his campaign trail, Mr. Rahman had promised to “boost regional and international trade and commerce through infrastructural development, technical modernisation, and skills enhancement in all seaports and river ports.” The Hindu was told these promises are being examined in Delhi for possible areas of cooperation. That apart, both sides will have issues such as renewal of the Ganga Water Treaty later this year that are also being studied.
Mr. Rahman is expected to take charge as the new Prime Minister of Bangladesh on Tuesday (February 17, 2026) and there is significant pressure on him to deliver on the foreign policy front. Addressing questions from journalists in the first press interaction on Saturday (February 14, 2026), Mr. Rahman had indicated that he will decide on international cooperation based on Bangladesh’s national interest.
In response to a question on Bangladesh’s stance on China’s Belt and Road Initiative, Mr. Rahman said, “We will try to protect the interests of the people of Bangladesh. If something is not in Bangladesh’s interest, naturally we cannot pursue it. I am certain that mutual interests will be our first priority.” While India and Bangladesh have maintained ties during the 17 months of the interim government, the two sides have not hosted each other’s top leaders during this period. The relationship and especially major connectivity projects have therefore taken a hit in this period. That apart, the two sides have experienced stressful phases as witnessed in December 2025 in the aftermath of the murder of young Islamist leader Sharif Osman Hadi when mobs threatened Indian diplomatic missions and visa centres.
According to an estimate, around 49 agitations were organised in 17 months that delivered threats to India’s missions in Bangladesh. One of the main expectations, The Hindu has learned, would be for the new administration to ensure security and protection of India’s diplomatic missions and visa centres so that the visa services, that are vital for commercial and people-to-people ties, can be normalised by both sides.
The relation however will face considerable strain because of political activities that former Prime Minister Hasina and her former colleagues continue to carry out from Indian cities. While the Awami League of Ms. Hasina continues to remain banned here, Mr. Rahman has spoken against ‘revenge’ politics and has said the wrong doings of the previous regime will be subjected to a judicial process.

The human development gains made by Kerala are not the end of a path but the starting point for a new stage of economic and social progress, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Sunday, calling this the ‘central idea’ of the State government’s Vision 2031 for the State.
Inaugurating the three-day ‘Vision 2031: An International Conference on Development and Democracy’ organised by the State Planning Board here, Mr. Vijayan said Kerala is setting newer models for the world by constantly renewing itself in tune with the needs of the changing times. “As Kerala approaches its 75th year (in 2031), the goal is not merely to celebrate past achievements. The goal is to prepare for the future: an economy that is productive and knowledge-based, a society that is inclusive and just, a State that is resilient in the face of climate challenges, and a democracy that continues to value discussion and participation,” he said.
The coming five years offer the State an opportunity to bring together growth and justice, technology and humanity, modernisation and sustainability. “Kerala’s history shows that such a balance is possible,” he said. The success of this vision, according to him, hinges not merely on government action, but on a collective effort by society.
He described the Vision 2031 conference, in which more than 120 international experts are participating, as not just a review exercise, but an effort to chart the next phase of Kerala’s development journey. When Kerala completes 75 years as a State, it will also be a moment that demands reflection and imagination, he said. “Seventy-five years is a long period, enough to assess where we began, what we have achieved, and what remains to be done.”
Mr. Vijayan described fiscal constraints and the Centre’s restrictions on borrowing and revenue centralisation as challenges that Kerala continues to face.

TITLE: Congress resorting to malpractices for ULB chiefs’ elections: BRS

HYDERABAD
The ruling Congress is resorting to malpractices, undemocratic methods and anarchy for the election of municipal chairpersons and mayors by forcibly admitting those elected on other party tickets or by threatening them, general secretary of the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) and former IPS officer R.S. Praveen Kumar said.
Speaking to newspersons here on Sunday, he said the Congress could win only four municipalities in 2020 and this time the BRS had polled about 30% votes. Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy was ridiculing the democracy by keeping the key portfolios such as home, municipal administration, education and others with him.
The fact that the entire municipal election process was completed within one week was clearly indicating why Mr. Revanth Reddy was keeping the home and municipal administration portfolios with him. The realty sector was in doldrums as he was keeping the municipal portfolio with him.
He alleged that the State Election Commission had become a puppet in the hands of the government as it could not even serve a notice on Mr. Revanth Reddy even after he asked the voters in Vikarabad to support Congress and the BRS lodging a complaint on it. Similarly, there were incidents involving TPCC working president T. Jagga Reddy and MP Dharmapuri Arvind at Sangareddy and Nizamabad on the day of polling attracting notices from SEC, but in vain.
A case was registered against Mr. Jagga Reddy in the evening for namesake. Despite sending money bags, the ruling party could win hardly 51% of wards, Mr. Praveen Kumar alleged. He further alleged that the Chief Minister was sending police to BRS camps by identifying locations through phone-tapping.
Dande Vittal, a BRS MLC defected to the Congress, was provided an ex-officio vote in Kagaznagar though he did not vote there since he had his vote registered in the Sanathnagar Assembly Constituency in the city. He demanded that the election to municipal chairpersons and mayors be held transparently.

--------------------
Priyank Kharge
Attacking Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) again, Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister Priyank Kharge on Sunday accused the RSS of indulging in “money laundering” even as he questioned RSS’s source of income. Questioning the unregistered status of RSS, the Minister said that he will ensure that the RSS gets registered one day or the other.
“RSS has a network of more than 2,500 organisations, including those in America and England. They are taking money in the name of Guru Dakshina. The Guru is defined as the flag, and the money is being collected in the name of the flag. I am telling that these people are into money laundering,” said the Minister, who, a couple of months back, had stoked a controversy urging Chief Minister Siddaramaiah to curtail the activities of RSS. “Where are they getting this kind of money? How is it coming? They want us to be good citizens by paying income tax, but they want to remain free,” he said here during the release of Karavaliya Raktha Kanneeru, a book recounting the horrors of communal riots in the coastal region.
On RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat’s statement that the RSS was a body of individuals not requiring registration, Mr. Kharge said: “If not today, they will have to register (themselves). I will ensure it. As long as we have the law and the Constitution, it will happen. Because we have left them (without registering) for 100 years, should we leave them for another 100 years? To do it, you have to have political will and be legally and constitutionally right”.
The Minister said that it is good for organisations- whether RSS or others- to come under the ambit of the law. “They (RSS) are unregistered now. Are they above the law? Are they above the Constitution? (RSS chief) Mohan Bhagwat recently said in Bengaluru that they are a body of individuals. Even the Bangalore Club is a body of individuals. Have they not registered? Are they not paying tax?” he asked.
Being a vocal critic of the RSS, Mr. Kharge has taken on the organisation in recent times. He was accused of stonewalling the RSS centenary celebrations march at Chittapur, which was eventually held after the Karnataka High Court’s intervention. In October, he wrote to the Chief Minister seeking a ban on RSS activities on government premises.
Referring to the Chittapur controversy, he said, “The RSS had given an application to just inform the administration about the march. Will any organisation get approval for such information or should they specifically seek permission? Are they above law?”
Taking a dig at Mr. Bhagwat, the Minister said, “The RSS chief suggests people have three kids to protect the country and religion. However, he has remained a bachelor. All of you should beget children, but he will remain a bachelor. How does it work? Will he certify you for patriotism? Will he teach us what we are?”
Later, speaking to reporters here, the Minister explained, “What I am asking is why these organisations have remained unregistered. Where is their Guru Dakshina coming from? Who is paying the Guru Dakshina? Why is it (RSS) not paying tax? When every rupee of others is being accounted for, why is there no accountability for their money?”
Mr. Kharge said, “If you want to contribute to RSS, you cannot give. What I am saying is that the law or the Constitution that is applicable for all, should be applicable to them too”.
Likening the RSS and BJP to a devil and its shadow, Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister Priyank Kharge on Sunday said that the fight for improvement of the country should be with the devil itself. “The RSS is the devil, and the BJP is its shadow. We are currently fighting with the devil’s shadow. If we fight the devil itself, the country will improve.” He said that the condition of the BJP without the RSS will be worse than the Janata Dal (Secular), and it will decline to a lower level than a regional party. Mr. Kharge a suggested that the Janata Dal (Secular) should remove Secular from its name.

Describing the forthcoming Assembly election as a “war between Delhi and Tamil Nadu”, DMK youth wing leader and Deputy Chief Minister Udhayanidhi Stalin on Sunday called upon his party’s youth wing members to see themselves as “front line warriors” in a contest he framed as one between “Tamil and Hindi imposition” and between “social justice and social injustice”.
Addressing a meeting of Thanjavur district youth wing members at Sengipatti, Mr. Udhayanidhi said the youth and women of the State are firmly with the DMK. “When people ask which side the youth and women are on, we tell them they are with us,” he said.
According to him, no other party in the country had a youth wing with comparable organisational strength, including booth-level committees down to the local unit level, as the DMK.
Mr. Udhayanidhi said: “Now there is a group in our State that is roaming around — they only make noise, no ambition or ideology, nothing. The group doesn’t even know what it is. They think politics is entertainment. You, our youth wing brothers, should tell them politics is about commitment and dedication. Using a group that has no commitment or dedication, no one can achieve anything. Our youth wing has the responsibility of defeating old and new slaves.”
Alleging “fascist forces” were attempting to stall the State government’s flagship Magalir Urimai Thogai scheme, Mr. Udhayanidhi said: “When our leader heard that a BJP advocate had moved the Supreme Court to halt the ₹1,000 assistance, he said, ‘If they think they can stop me from giving ₹1,000, I will give ₹5,000,’ and ensured the grant reached the people of Tamil Nadu,” he said.
Mr. Udhayanidhi said over the past two months, financial assistance amounting to ₹9,000 had been extended to people in the State through various measures, including Pongal support, monthly assistance under the Magalir Urimai Thogai, and additional relief. He added that under a future “Dravidian model 2.0” government, the assistance would be enhanced to ₹2,000.
DMK leaders, including Ministers S. Regupathy, Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi, and Govi Chezhiaan, and Thanjavur MP S. Murasoli were present.

Andhra Pradesh is initiating comprehensive reforms in public healthcare with technical support from the Gates Foundation, Minister for Health Satya Kumar Yadav said.
In a statement on Sunday (February 15), the Minister said the partnership aligns with the vision of Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu to achieve the ‘Healthy Andhra Pradesh’ goal and said that the Foundation’s co-founder Bill Gates is scheduled to visit Amaravati on Monday (February 16) to review the State’s ongoing initiatives and discuss future action plans.
Mr. Satya Kumar said the primary aim of the collaboration is to ensure universal access to affordable healthcare through modern technology and systemic reforms, to improve nutritional security and public health outcomes, to achieve scalable solutions and to shift from a reactive treatment-based model to a preventive, predictive healthcare approach.
He said the government plans to introduce early disease detection systems, personalised health profiling, advance warning mechanisms for potential illnesses, individual health cards and expanded digital health services, including telemedicine.
The Minister said based on the Foundation’s recommendation, the State had constituted a high-power expert advisory group comprising 10 international experts to review existing healthcare systems and recommend reforms. Three sub-committees are being formed to focus on specific areas, he informed.
An integrated, real-time health monitoring initiative called ‘Sanjeevani’ has been launched in collaboration with Tata MD, he said, adding that the pilot project, which began in Kuppam, has been expanded across Chittoor district and will soon be implemented statewide. “The programme integrates various health centres through technology to strengthen real-time public health surveillance and response,” he explained.
He said the State is also taking concrete steps to introduce Artificial Intelligence-based technologies in healthcare services. Discussions on formulating a national AI-based health policy were initiated in Vijayawada last December in partnership with the Gates Foundation and representatives from other States, he said.
The Minister said that with support from the Foundation, the government launched a ‘MedTech Challenge’ to identify AI-enabled medical devices and solutions. “Around 100 applicants participated and, after two rounds of screening, 20 were shortlisted, he said, adding that their technologies were being tested in government hospitals under a pilot programme and a final decision will be taken by the end of March.
He said the focus areas included AI-based diagnostic tests, portable point-of-care testing centres, smart monitoring and wearable devices, telemedicine tools for remote areas and data integration and disease surveillance. He said health data collected from various sources will be integrated with the RTGS “Aware” platform to enable early detection of disease outbreaks and data-driven policy formulation.
He said the Foundation is also supporting the establishment of a Digital Modelling and Intelligence Decision Centre (DMIDC) at Dr. NTR University of Health Sciences to strengthen data analytics and strategic health planning.

Home Minister G. Parameshwara inaugurated the newly constructed police residential quarters at Suntikoppa in Kodagu district on Sunday.
The 12 residential quarters for police constables  have been built at a cost of ₹ 3.64 crore by the Karnataka State Police Housing and Infrastructure Development Corporation (KSPH&IDC).
Speaking after inaugurating the housing facility, the Minister said that around 40,000 residential quarters have already been constructed for police personnel across the state, while another 60,000 houses are still required.
Pointing out that the salaries of constables, who serve at the lowest ranks in the police department, had been increased, Mr. Parameshwara said the Government is providing improved housing facilities after taking note of the fact that many police personnel live in cramped houses.
Accordingly, the KSPH & IDC will provide housing in a phased manner up to the year 2030, he said.
Earlier, buildings were constructed at a cost of about ₹ 18 lakh per unit, but now the cost has increased to around ₹ 33 lakh. The government’s aim is to ensure that police personnel lead a comfortable and dignified life, he added.
The Minister assured to look into the list of demands made by MLA Mantar Gowda and priority given to construction of housing facilities for police personnel, while necessary steps will also be taken to establish police stations as per the Government’s parameters.
He said various measures have been introduced to make the police department more people-friendly, urging police personnel to maintain friendly relations with the public while ensuring strict punishment for offenders.
He further noted that Karnataka Police ranks first in the country in terms of safety and security, and police personnel perform their duties day and night, in rain and heat, often without rest. Therefore, they should be respected, and no one should attempt to demoralise them.
The Home Minister said that out of the 593 assurances given by the Siddaramaiah-led government in 2023, more than half have already been fulfilled, and all promises would be implemented within the next two years.
He added that the government has spent ₹1.36 lakh crore on the five guarantee schemes, aiming to bring poorer sections into the mainstream through various welfare programmes.
He stated that the government is people-oriented and functioning as promised, and added that Chief Minister Siddaramaiah would present a strong budget on March 6.
MLA Dr. Mantar Gowda, speaking on the occasion, requested the Minister to fill vacant police posts, construct additional police quarters, and provide for the establishment of two more police stations in Kodagu district in the upcoming budget.
He also suggested utilising available land in the district for setting up a police training center.
Among those present were Southern Range Inspector General of Police Boralinagaiah, Deputy Commissioner S. J. Somashekar, Zilla Panchayat CEO Anand Prakash Meena, and Superintendent of Police R. N. Bindumani.

A simple message of solidarity from HRD Minister Nara Lokesh has set off a larger debate on communal harmony, political alliances, and public responsibility in the age of videos going viral.
Controversy began after a disturbing video surfaced from the Medaram Jatara in Telangana, one of the largest tribal religious gatherings in the country.
A street vendor from Kurnool district in Andhra Pradesh was allegedly forced by a group of YouTubers to eat the ‘kova bun’ he had brought for sale to prove he was not engaging in what they termed as “food jihad.”
The incident, reported by The Siasat Daily, triggered outrage across social media.
Many described the act as humiliating and baseless, accusing the content creators of stoking communal suspicion for online “views and likes.”
Tagging the news report, in a message that struck a softer, personal tone, rather than a combative one, Mr. Lokesh expressed regret that “Brother Vali had to endure such treatment.”
Amid the growing anger, Mr. Lokesh stepped in with a public message of support for the vendor, identified as Brother Vali. Expressing regret, the Minister said divisive and communal behaviour had no place in Telugu society, which he described as rooted in harmony, mutual respect, and brotherhood.
Adding a personal touch, he said he was looking forward to meeting Vali soon and tasting his “famous  Khoya [sic] bun.”
The gesture was widely appreciated.
In his response, Dr. Praveen praised Mr. Lokesh’s outreach. “Day by day you are impressing us with your heartfelt gestures, Lokesh garu. More power to you,” he wrote, calling the message a reaffirmation of unity.
Another Netizen, ‘Who cares’, wrote: “Our Telugu society has always stood for harmony and respect. A few hateful voices cannot divide us. Stay strong, Vali bhai.’”
However, the response was not uniformly positive.
The Hyderabad Intellectuals Forum welcomed the sentiment, but questioned its political consistency. In a sharp statement, the forum argued that if divisive politics were truly being rejected, the State government should reconsider its alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party, which, it accused, of promoting polarising narratives under Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The forum went further, urging Mr. Lokesh to “withdraw support to the BJP and rewrite the tweet” if he genuinely intended to distance himself from “communal politics.”
The episode has since evolved into a broader debate, not only about the harassment of a small vendor at a religious fair but also about the responsibility of digital content creators, the fragility of communal trust, and the expectations citizens place on political leaders.
What followed was a familiar digital storm - hashtags, rebuttals, ideological crossfire. But beneath the noise lies a quieter truth: a small vendor at a crowded fair became the centre of a larger conversation about dignity, digital responsibility, and the fragile lines that divide communities.

--------------------
The Kerala Government Medical College Teachers’ Association (KGMCTA) will from Monday onwards go on an indefinite strike, which will include a long-term boycott of outpatient (OP) clinical services as well as all academic activities. From February 19, the doctors will boycott indefinitely non-emergency surgeries and other elective procedures also.
The KGMCTA said in a statement on Sunday that even though it has been protesting since July 1, the State government failed to fulfil any of the promises made on various demands raised over the years. The demands raised include an end to the postponement of salary revision arrears of medical college doctors despite the full payment of salary revision arrears to State government employees,  rectification of the irregularities in the salary revision order, revision of the pension ceiling at Central rates, creation of sufficient posts in medical colleges, and payment of DA arrears.
After previous strike calls, the association had held meetings with Health Minister Veena George, after which the salary shortfall in the entry levels was resolved partially. However, no action has been taken regarding the payment of salary revision arrears, which is applicable to the vast majority of doctors, said the statement.
From February 26, the faculty will boycott university examination duties and related responsibilities.
The KGMCTA said they have exempted casualty (emergency services), labour room, ICUs, inpatient service and postmortem examinations from the strike. It said that the strike was necessary to safeguard the standard of medical education, to ensure the continued sustenance of government medical colleges, and to protect health care rights of ordinary patients.

--------------------
India is set to host the AI Impact Summit from February 16 to 20 at the grand Bharat Mandapam, bringing together global leaders, policymakers and industry heavyweights in Artificial Intelligence.
For India, the summit is not just a high-profile gathering. It is a statement of intent. New Delhi wants to signal that it does not aim to remain merely a participant in the AI revolution, but to emerge as a key architect shaping its rules, standards and opportunities.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the summit, visit the Expo and engage with global CEOs. At his invitation, several world leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and Brazilian President Lula da Silva, are expected to attend.
Ministerial delegations from over 45 countries, along with the UN Secretary General and senior international officials, will also take part in the event.
Why This Summit Matters
Artificial Intelligence has moved far beyond research labs. It is reshaping healthcare delivery, transforming agriculture, recalibrating financial markets and redefining education and work. In this context, the AI Impact Summit aims to widen the global conversation.
Earlier global meets focused strongly on AI safety and frontier risks. India is broadening the focus to highlight AI’s developmental impact — how it can drive economic growth, inclusion and sustainability. The emphasis is on “People, Planet, and Progress".
India will showcase its deep talent pool, digital public infrastructure and expanding startup ecosystem. Backed by the IndiaAI Mission’s push for compute capacity, datasets and skilling, the summit will reflect India’s strategy of balancing rapid innovation with appropriate safeguards.
IT Secretary S Krishnan has said the key message is that AI must be human-centric and inclusive. “The key message we want to send is that whatever happens with AI needs to be human-centric and inclusive. There needs to be democratic access to AI resources, and it needs to be done in a way where people are at the centre of this process," he told news agency PTI.
Big Themes To Watch
Seven thematic working groups will present proposals on AI Commons, trusted AI tools, shared compute infrastructure and sector-specific use cases. Over 700 sessions are planned over five days, covering AI safety, governance, ethical use, data protection and sovereign AI.
There will be strong focus on indigenous foundation models for strategic sectors. Discussions will also explore how AI is changing industries and what new skills will be needed in the job market.
India, with over 65 per cent of its population under 35, sees its young workforce as a major advantage in adapting to AI-driven industries. Reskilling and AI-focused training are likely to be key talking points.
Prominent CEOs Attending
The summit features a blockbuster list of global tech leaders. These include Sundar Pichai of Google, Sam Altman of OpenAI, Demis Hassabis of DeepMind Technologies, Dario Amodei of Anthropic and Brad Smith of Microsoft.
The presence of these influential figures places the summit at the centre of global tech deliberations. Frontier AI labs such as OpenAI and Anthropic, along with tech giants like Microsoft and Google, are expected to offer insights into the future direction of AI development.
Indian startup founders building indigenous models will also share the stage.
Spotlight On Sovereign AI
Ahead of the summit, 12 Indian AI startups selected under the Foundation Model Pillar presented their work to the Prime Minister. Their projects range from Indian language foundation models and multilingual tools to healthcare diagnostics, engineering simulations and generative AI applications.
India’s approach is innovation-first. While acknowledging the need for regulation, the government has said it stands ready to act when required, without harming innovation.
As the first global AI summit hosted in the Global South, the event also aims to bring developing nations to the AI high table. A joint declaration or roadmap for responsible AI deployment could emerge as a key outcome.

--------------------
From how to upload a Panchayat asset photo and its details to clarifying scheme guidelines, eGramSaathi, an AI-powered assistant developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, is now positioning itself as the digital bridge between village citizens and grassroots governance.
And this is not a pilot project tucked away in files. It will be live on the international stage at the India AI Impact Expo 2026 in New Delhi, starting February 16. News18 reviewed the documents prepared for the summit.
At a time when Artificial Intelligence (AI) is often showcased through flashy consumer apps and global tech debates, the Ministry of Panchayati Raj is quietly placing AI inside the Gram Sabha, empowering India’s grassroots governance.
The Ministry will present a suite of AI-enabled governance tools designed specifically for decentralised administration. Alongside eGramSaathi, there is SabhaSaar, an AI system that records, transcribes and converts Gram Sabha deliberations into structured, actionable minutes of meeting, reducing paperwork and ensuring decisions don’t dissolve into memory.
Then comes PRAMAN (Panchayati Raj Asset Monitoring and Notification), an image analytics platform that automatically validates uploaded asset photographs, checks authenticity, flags duplication and assesses quality. In a system where physical asset verification often slows schemes, automation could prove transformative.
But the showcase is not confined to dashboards and screens. Visitors will be able to — Be the Sarpanch — a role-based simulation placing participants inside AI-assisted decision-making scenarios. A virtual reality Gram Sabha experience, immersive walkthroughs and live demonstrations aim to show how technology can simplify complex administrative processes without displacing human agency.
The larger message is unmistakable here. AI in India’s public systems is not being framed merely as efficiency software, but as an accountability tool. By embedding transcription accuracy, image verification and instant citizen responses into Panchayat workflows, the Ministry is signalling that emerging technologies can strengthen transparency at the grassroots, where governance is most immediate.
As India hosts what is being described as a first-of-its-kind global AI summit in the Global South, the rural Ministry’s bet is clear. The future of AI will not be defined only in boardrooms, but in village meetings, asset registers and citizen queries, answered, perhaps, by a chatbot.

--------------------
In a significant move towards fostering international collaboration in artificial intelligence, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s senior aide, Maxim Oreshkin, will lead a substantial delegation to the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi starting Monday.
India is set to host the AI Impact Summit 2026, a prestigious event that will convene global leaders and industry giants in the field of Artificial Intelligence. Scheduled to take place from February 16-20 at New Delhi’s ‘Bharat Mandapam,’ the summit aims to bring together policymakers, industry leaders, and technology innovators to discuss the future of AI.
Maxim Oreshkin, deputy chief of the Kremlin staff and economic aide to President Putin, is designated to head the Russian delegation. A Kremlin source told PTI that this choice underscores a strategic effort to enhance AI collaboration between Russia and India. The delegation will focus on secure, trusted, and sovereign AI, engaging actively in discussions on AI governance, technology, and partnerships within BRICS and other international platforms, the source added.
In an interview to BRICS TV Network on February 9, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said: “India also emphasises ICT security, which we actively support, contributing to the agenda. This is significant, as norms regulating AI use between states, and AI applications by individual states, are only now being established." Lavrov said these norms will regulate behaviours that affect security.
“Some countries are actively introducing AI into military applications. While each state has the right to determine its own approach, certain countries are already attempting to centralise control, subordinating what states can and may do with AI in the military sphere," he added.
BRICS members will not accept infringements on their sovereignty, yet transparency remains crucial, the minister added.
India’s Ambassador to Russia, Vinay Kumar, in an article published by the state-run news agency TASS on Friday, elaborated on the promising prospects for AI cooperation between India and Russia. He underscored the growing strategic and technological partnership, asserting that the collaboration in AI would serve as a catalyst for mutual growth and technological advancement for both nations.

LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/budget-2026-reflects-indias-aspiration-to-become-a-developed-nation-pm-modi-9905252.html
--------------------
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said that the Union Budget 2026-27, which was presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1, reflects “India’s yearning to become a developed nation".
In an exclusive interview with news agency PTI, the Prime Minister described the budget as a “we are ready" moment, born out of preparation and inspiration, rather than a “now or never" moment forced by compulsion.
“None of our budgets are run-of-the-mill ‘bahi-khata’ documents; that’s not our approach," he added.
PM Modi pointed out that India is witnessing the most expansive infrastructure push in its history, built with future readiness in mind. He said, “India has to be strong and prepared at all times, and that is what we are doing," referring to the defence budget and modernisation plans.
The Union Budget 2026 has unveiled a series of measures aimed at accelerating growth across infrastructure, power, renewable energy and technology, offering a significant demand boost for the capital goods sector.
The proposals are expected to benefit engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) companies as well as domestic manufacturers by lowering production costs and enhancing competitiveness.
On the economic front, PM Modi said that restored “political stability and predictability" have strengthened investor confidence in India, enabling the country to negotiate trade agreements from a position of strength.
Speaking on free trade agreements (FTAs), he said the deals are designed to expand market access for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in sectors such as textiles, leather, chemicals, handicrafts, and gems.
“Stronger manufacturing, services, MSMEs enable India to negotiate trade pacts from a position of strength," the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister also criticised previous Congress-led UPA governments over their economic management, saying India was then unable to negotiate trade pacts with confidence. “During UPA rule, talks would begin and then breakdown; a little real substance achieved despite long negotiations." he noted.

LINK: https://www.news18.com/auto/after-ajit-pawar-plane-crash-govt-carrying-out-thorough-study-of-non-scheduled-operators-ws-l-9905150.html
--------------------
Civil Aviation Minister K Rammohan Naidu has said the government is conducting a “very thorough study" of flight operations by non-scheduled operators and uncontrolled airfields to survey areas where steps need to be taken.
The flight operations by Non-Scheduled Operators (NSOPs) came under increased scrutiny after the fatal crash of a VSR Ventures-owned LearJet 45 plane that killed Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar and four others near the Baramati airport on January 28.
Earlier this month, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had initiated a special safety audit of NSOPs.
PTI quoted Naidu saying that the civil aviation ministry is doing a “thorough study" of the NSOPs, as well as the uncontrolled airfields.
NSOPs are entities which do not have a fixed schedule for operators and mostly operate chartered flights. Baramati, where January 28 incident took place, is an uncontrolled airfield wherein traffic information is provided by instructors/pilots from the flying training organisations.
The civil aviation minister said areas where something needs to be done with respect to NSOPs and uncontrolled airfields will be looked into.
In reply to a question on whether the ministry would be looking at having a ‘too big to fail’ concept for the airlines, PTI quoted minister Rammohan Naidu saying the focus will be to boost airlines with smaller operations.
The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) will likely release its preliminary report on the fatal accident soon.
Following the crash, the ministry in its statement said the “aircraft was cleared to land on runway 11 at 0843IST; however, they did not give a readback of the landing clearance".
“Next, the ATC saw the flames around the threshold of runway 11 at 0844 IST. The emergency services then rushed to the crash site," it had said.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday inaugurated a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)-enabled Public Distribution System (PDS) in Gandhinagar, calling it another step in taking the Digital India initiative into welfare delivery.
Speaking at the launch, Shah said technology developed over the past decade is now being applied to essential services such as food distribution to improve transparency and efficiency.
He said, “Today, as an extension of Digital India, inspired by Narendra Modi, digital systems are reaching even food and supply management. When I use the term Digital India and look back 11 years, it is hard to imagine that nearly 600 million people in this country came from families that did not have even a single bank account. And today, the same India, 11-12 years later, under the leadership of PM Modi, is accounting for half of the world’s digital transactions. This means that if there are two digital transactions anywhere in the world, one takes place in India—one in the rest of the world and one in India. This transformation has occurred within a span of just 11-12 years."
Shah added, “Inspired by Prime Minister Modi’s vision, the expansion of Digital India is today reaching, in a way, the realm of food and supply arrangements… Today, under Prime Minister Modi’s leadership, half of the world’s digital transactions are taking place in India… This transformation has come in just an interval of 11-12 years, and today that same Digital India is stepping into the field of providing affordable grain to the poor…"
According to him, the new system is intended to make ration distribution more transparent and ensure benefits reach citizens in a smoother and more reliable manner.

TITLE: Maharashtra Congress Chief Booked For Calling Tipu Sultan ‘Symbol Of Bravery’ Like Shivaji
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/maharashtra-congress-chief-booked-for-calling-tipu-sultan-symbol-of-bravery-like-shivaji-9904793.html
--------------------
Harshwardhan Sapkal, the Maharashtra Congress chief, has been booked by Pune police after he described Tipu Sultan as a “symbol of bravery" comparable to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.
The case was registered following a complaint by city BJP chief Dhiraj Ghate, who alleged that Sapkal’s remarks were provocative and hurt religious sentiments.
The complaint relates to Sapkal’s comments about similarities between Shivaji and Tipu Sultan.
After Sapkal’s statement comparing Tipu Sultan with Shivaji, leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Ahilyanagar announced a Rs 10 lakh reward for anyone who would cut off his tongue.
The announcement was made during a protest held in front of the Shivaji memorial, where BJP workers alleged that Sapkal’s remarks were objectionable.
Party workers staged a ‘shoe protest’ against Sapkal and raised slogans at the site.
The statement has triggered sharp political reactions and increased tensions in the region.
Sapkal said journalists had asked him whether photographs of all great leaders should be displayed together in offices, and how he viewed the demand that the photos of Shivaji and Tipu Sultan should be placed side by side.
While replying, he said, “Fadnavis’ old habit of twisting words turning ‘dha’ into ‘ma’ has resurfaced, and he has found an opportunity to create a Hindu-Muslim controversy."
Sapkal had made his remarks on Saturday while speaking to reporters about a controversy over a portrait of Tipu Sultan displayed in the office of the Malegaon municipal corporation’s deputy mayor Shan-e-Hind Nihal Ahmed, who is Muslim.
The portrait of Tipu Sultan, known for fighting British colonialists, is being opposed by the Shiv Sena and other groups.
Sapkal said in Marathi that Tipu had followed Shivaji’s ideals.
“The kind of bravery that Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj possessed and the concept of ‘swarajya’ (self-rule) that he introduced… much later, following in that very tradition and taking inspiration from his ideals, Tipu Sultan waged war against the British," he said.
“In that sense, Tipu Sultan was a great warrior who displayed immense bravery and was a true son of India. He never allowed any poisonous or communal ideas to sway him. As a symbol of bravery, we should view Tipu Sultan as equivalent to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj," he added.
According to ANI, the complaint said Sapkal’s remarks “hurt the sentiments of Hindus", apparently because Tipu was a Muslim and Shivaji a Hindu, and could disturb communal harmony.
Ghate said the remarks hurt the sentiments of Hindus “who believe and consider Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as God".
“I don’t understand what point Harshwardhan Sapkal wants to prove by making such a statement, which hurts sentiments," he said.
The case has been registered under sections 192, 196(1), 196(2), 352 and 356(2) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. Police said further investigation is underway.

--------------------
In the heart of Nagpur stands Deekshabhoomi — not just as a monument of stone and marble, but as a living memory of a historic turning point in India’s social journey. It was here, in 1956, that Dr B. R. Ambedkar embraced Buddhism along with lakhs of followers, marking a profound moment of social assertion and spiritual transformation.
Now, the Maharashtra government led by CM Devendra Fadnavis has embarked on an ambitious plan to redevelop and beautify the sacred precinct, with an estimated outlay of Rs 70 crore.
The project, to be undertaken by the Nagpur Metropolitan Region Development Authority (NMRDA), aims to transform the 58,000 square metre area into a world-class heritage landscape — while preserving its dignity, sanctity and symbolism.
For the millions who visit every year, especially during Dhamma Chakra Pravartan Din, Deekshabhoomi is not merely a tourist site. It is a space of reflection, identity and hope. The redevelopment plan seeks to enhance that experience. Master planning and concept design will reorganise the site to ensure smoother pilgrim movement, with clearly demarcated meditation and silence zones.
Special emphasis will be placed on universal accessibility — making pathways barrier-free for the elderly, women and divyang visitors.
Soft landscaping inspired by Buddhist philosophy will introduce meditation gardens, green buffers and indigenous tree plantations. Hardscaping elements such as plazas, paved forecourts, stone works and seating areas will be redesigned to create dignified ceremonial spaces.
The government also plans to install architectural and landscape lighting, energy-efficient systems, and smart illumination to enhance safety without disturbing the spiritual ambience.
Beyond aesthetics, the project includes vital infrastructure upgrades — drainage and storm-water management, sanitation facilities, drinking water points, signage in Marathi, Hindi and English, and enhanced security systems including CCTV surveillance.
A thoughtfully designed public address and ambient sound system will assist in crowd management during peak gatherings while maintaining acoustic sanctity.
Importantly, interpretation zones narrating the life and philosophy of Dr Ambedkar will be developed, ensuring that younger generations understand why this ground holds such deep constitutional and cultural significance.
Officials insist that every intervention will be carried out in consultation with the Samaj Kalyan Department and in alignment with government policy, with “absolute respect" for the spiritual and social ethos of the site.
For many visitors, the hope is simple — that Deekshabhoomi remains what it has always been: a place of dignity and quiet strength, now supported by infrastructure befitting its global stature.

--------------------
NCP (SP) MLA Rohit Pawar on Saturday said he has written to Union Home Minister Amit Shah seeking a comprehensive and transparent investigation into the January 28 plane crash that killed Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar.
In a post on social media, the Karjat-Jamkhed legislator said he had emailed the Home Minister, Civil Aviation Minister K Rammohan Naidu, and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), attaching a detailed presentation outlining his concerns related to the crash.
Sharing copies of the correspondence, Rohit Pawar said his demand for a probe was not politically motivated but aimed at ensuring that the truth behind the accident is established beyond doubt.
“It is important that the actual sequence of events is placed before the people so that there is no room for speculation or suspicion," he said.
Earlier, at a press conference on February 10, Rohit Pawar had claimed there were grounds to suspect sabotage in the fatal air crash and called for a deeper examination of all possible angles.
The crash occurred on January 28 when a chartered Learjet 45 carrying Ajit Pawar crashed while attempting to land at Baramati airport in Pune district.
The aircraft came down near the runway threshold, killing all five people on board.
The deceased included Pawar, his personal security officer, a flight attendant, and the pilot and co-pilot. Pawar was travelling from Mumbai to Baramati to campaign for the Zilla Parishad elections.
Meanwhile, the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) and the DGCA are probing the incident.
Union Minister of State for Civil Aviation Murlidhar Mohol said on February 7 that investigators had recovered the aircraft’s black box and that its data is currently being analysed.
Authorities have not yet released details on the cause of the crash, and officials said the investigation is ongoing.

LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/have-faith-in-our-agencies-aviation-minister-rejects-italian-media-report-on-air-india-crash-9904629.html
--------------------
Days after an Italian media report on the Air India crash, Union Minister of State for Civil Aviation Murlidhar Mohol rejected claims about the investigation into the crash in Ahmedabad last year, saying the probe is still underway.
His statement came after an Italian newspaper reported that Indian investigators were preparing to say in their final findings that Air India Flight 171 crashed because one of the pilots shut off the plane’s fuel controls.
Mohol denied the report and said investigation agencies are looking into the matter.
“I just want to inform you all that our investigation agencies are probing the matter. Should we have faith in our own agencies or outsiders? Our agencies are working on it," he was quoted as saying by PTI on Saturday.
“Once the final report is finalised, then only it will be justifiable to comment on it," he added.
The report in Corriere della Sera said Indian investigators were preparing to state in their final report that Air India Flight 171 crashed because one of the pilots switched off the aircraft’s fuel switches in an act that was “almost certainly" intentional.
It said the claim would rely on findings that no technical fault was detected in the aircraft, suggesting the crash may have been caused by human action. The newspaper added that cockpit voice recordings, cleared of background noise, identified which pilot moved the fuel switch “from RUN to CUTOFF".
The report said it was still not known whether the final findings would directly assign blame. It named the pilot, Sumeet Sabharwal, who died in the crash, as being at the centre of the matter.
The publication said a conclusion pointing to the flight captain would be a “desired turning point" for US experts who have been presenting evidence to Indian authorities, as the Indian side has refused to accept a human role in the disaster.
It also said sound analysis clearly showed which pilot carried out the move and ruled out the possibility of an error.
The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau said reports claiming that the investigation into Air India Flight AI-171 had been completed were “incorrect and speculative".
“The investigation is still in progress. No final conclusions have been reached," it said.
The agency referred to its preliminary report and added that the final investigation report, containing conclusions and safety recommendations, would be published after completion of the probe in line with international norms.
In one of India’s deadliest air accidents, 260 people, including 241 passengers, were killed when Air India’s Air India Boeing 787-8 aircraft operating flight AI171 to London crashed shortly after take-off from Ahmedabad on June 12, 2025.

The State’s interim Budget for the financial year 2026-2027 will be presented in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly on Tuesday (February 17, 2026) with Finance Minister Thangam Thennarasu presenting the State’s interim Budget ahead of the Assembly elections this year.
The Economic Survey of Tamil Nadu 2025-26, handed over to Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on Monday (February 16, 2026), said the State’s per capita income growth has consistently outpaced the national average. Tamil Nadu can achieve its trillion-dollar economy milestone by 2031 if it sustains the 2024-25 nominal growth rate of 16%, “with an assumption of 2% (medium-term rate) rise in the value of dollar against rupee per annum in the medium term,” it added.
The Finance Minister will also present in the House the demand for advance grants for the year 2026-2027 and additional expenditure for 2025-2026 for its approval, on Friday (February 20, 2026).
Fort St. George, which houses the Tamil Nadu Assembly, has been decorated with banana trees, flowers and festoons as the DMK government is ready to present it interim Budget for the election year.
This is the last budget of the sixth tenure of the DMK government that captured power in 1967.
Tamil Nadu government has consistently increased its expenditure on the social sector, rising from ₹1,13,268 crore in 2021-22 to ₹1,57,864 crore in 2025-26 (RE). Over time, the State has built one of India’s most extensive and innovative welfare architectures, the Survey said.
Programmes such as                 Naan Mudhalvan,                 Pudhumai Penn,                 Tamizh Pudhalvan, the Chief Minister’s Breakfast Scheme,                 Kalaignar Magalir Urimai Thittam, and large-scale housing and urban renewal initiatives expand capabilities, reduce household risk, and strengthen aspirations. These interventions are not merely redistributive; they stabilise consumption, sustain domestic demand, and enable workers to avoid distress-driven employment.
The Economic Survey 2025-26 also mentioned that Tamil Nadu’s per capita income growth has consistently outpaced the national average.
In 2024-25, per capita income reached ₹3.62 lakh, which is 1.77 times higher than the national average of ₹2.05 lakh, making Tamil Nadu the third-largest State in terms of per capita income.
Despite accounting for only 4% of India’s land area and 6% of its population, the State contributed 9.4% to the national GDP in 2024-25. Its Gross State Domestic Product at current prices reached ₹31.19 lakh crore in 2024-25, reflecting a nominal growth rate of 16% and a real growth rate of 11.2% – the highest among major States.
Tamil Nadu's Economic Survey projects a trillion-dollar economy by 2031, contingent on sustained high growth rates despite potential dollar fluctuations.
The State’s interim Budget for the financial year 2026-2027 will be presented in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly on Tuesday (February 17, 2026) with Finance Minister Thangam Thennarasu presenting the State’s interim Budget ahead of the Assembly elections this year.
He will also present in the House the demand for advance grants for the year 2026-2027 and additional expenditure for 2025-2026 for its approval, on Friday (February 20, 2026).

After the Orissa High Court directed the State Government to complete the exercise of tallying the jewellery found from Ratna Bhandar, treasury of Shree Jagannath Temple, Puri, with the 1978 catalogue, Chief Minister Mohan Majhi-chaired high level meeting on Monday (February 16, 2026) announced to shortly inventory the precious metal.
As per the information presented before Odisha CM, all preparatory procedures required for the counting and inventory have been fully completed.
“The complete repair and conservation work of both the outer and inner Ratna Bhandar has already been finished. The entire work was carried out by the Archaeological Survey of India over 95 days, involving 333 hours of work. At present, both the temple administration and the State government are fully prepared to begin the counting and inventory process,” said a statement issued by Chief Minister’s Office.
“The Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the counting and inventory has been prepared by the Shree Jagannath Temple Managing Committee. The process will commence after receiving government approval. The entire exercise will be conducted with complete transparency under strict security arrangements,” it further said.
The last inventory was conducted in 1978. In the current process, the assets will be verified against the 1978 list and a final updated inventory will be prepared. The entire process will also include photography and the preparation of a digital catalogue.
A division bench of Orissa High Court comprising Chief Justice Harish Tandon and Judge Justice M.S. Raman recently directed to complete the process of tallying and come up with inventory report within three next three months.
As per the last inventory carried out 45 years ago, the Ratna Bhandar had more than 1.2 quintal of gold and 2.2 quintal of silver. In addition to this, there is sizeable amount of gold ornaments which are in regular use in the temple. For obvious reasons, the State government had shown ‘reluctance’ to open the treasury of Shree Jagannath Temple.
The court observed that, “it is no gain saying that the inventory of the jewelleries and valuables of Lord Shri Jagannath which was conducted way back in the year 1978 shall be the bench mark document in order to ascertain the inventory undertaken by the committee subsequently constituted by the State Government, whether all the jewelleries and valuables of Lord Shri Jagannath, which were found at the time of inventory conducted in the year 1978 tallies with the inventory done by the present committee.”

The Budget Session of the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly witnessed a stormy opening on Monday (February 16, 2026) with the Opposition Congress MLAs creating an uproar during Governor Mangubhai Patel’s address over the recent diarrhoea outbreak in Indore due to government-supplied contaminated water that caused several deaths.
Earlier, the day’s proceedings commenced with the singing of six stanzas of the national song Vande Matram in accordance with the Union Ministry of Home Affairs’ January 28 directive.
On February 12, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Mohan Yadav had welcomed the MHA’s move and said that the State will implement the directive.
In the Assembly, the uproar began when Governor Patel was speaking about the government’s water related initiatives and schemes, and said highlighted a project to divert the Kanh river away from the Shipra river in Ujjain to prevent the latter from getting polluted.
During this, Leader of Opposition in the Assembly and Congress MLA Umang Singhar rose and alleged that several crucial issues such as providing clean tap water to rural households and the water contamination deaths were ignored in the Governor’s address.
Mr. Singhar said, “Honourable Governor, you skipped the page about ‘nal jal’ (tap water). You mentioned Shipra but did not even reach Indore where such a huge tragedy took place in Bhagirathpura.”
Addressing the Speaker, Mr. Singhar said that the Governor had “forgotten” about the issue of clean water. He was joined by various other Congress MLAs.
The LoP’s objection led to a chaotic situation in the House between the Opposition and Treasury Benches even as Mr. Patel continued to read his address. While the Congress MLAs resorted to sloganeering against the government and objected to the Governor’s address, ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLAs thumped benches in support of it.
The Governor only read select parts from his complete written address that is available on the Assembly’s website. After Mr. Patel proceeded from the Assembly, Speaker Narendra Singh Tomar said that the remaining parts of his address will be considered as read.
The tragedy in Indore’s Bhagirathpura area that began in December, 2025, has so far claimed 16 lives, as per an audit report submitted by the government authorities in the Madhya Pradesh High Court. The audit was conducted by a panel of doctors from the State-run Mahatma Gandhi Memorial (MGM) Medical College, which termed causes of at least eight deaths as inconclusive.
However, local residents and media reports claim that at least 35 people have died in the lower-middle class locality of Indore. The tragedy was caused by contaminated water supplied by the BJP-ruled Indore Municipal Corporation and various government investigations have confirmed a polymicrobial infection in water and high levels of fecal coliform in it due to various sources, including mixing of sewage and drinking water in the decades-old close-running underground pipelines.
The Budget Session will continue until March 6 and the Budget will be presented on February 18.

--------------------
The Karur Town Police has registered a case against BJP Karur district president V.V. Senthilnathan for making derogatory remarks against Congress MP  S. Jothimani during a demonstration organised by the BJP near the Head Post Office in the town recently.
The case was booked on Sunday acting on a complaint from N. Ramesh, Karur district president of the Congress under various sections of the BNS read with Section 4 of the Tamil Prohibition of Harassment of Woman Act.  Police sources adding that investigation was on.
Condemning Mr. Senthilnathan’s remarks. Ms. Jothimani in a social media post said “what happened to me is not a personal incident. It is part of a long and continuing pattern of individual, obscene attacks that women who step into public spaces in this country have faced for generations.”
“Sexually degrading language, threats and public humiliation are not accidental. For years, they have been deliberately used as weapons against women.  These obscene attacks are carried out to silence women, to drive us out of public spaces, out of politics and out of leadership”, Ms. Jothimani said.
“Viewing women merely as sexual objects, as machines for reproduction, humiliating women and using obscene attacks as a political weapon is the ideology of the BJP and the RSS.  From the BJP state leadership down to district level leaders, this mindset is openly on display”, she charged.

The adjudicating authority under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) has passed an order imposing a penalty of ₹184 crore in the case of PPK Newsclick Studio Private Limited, the Enforcement Directorate said on Monday (February 16, 2026).
The company owns NewsClick, a digital news platform, which was founded by its editor-in-chief Prabir Purkayastha.
The adjudication proceedings were initiated on a complaint under Section 16 of FEMA filed by the ED alleging contraventions of FEMA and the rules and regulations pertaining to the receipt and utilisation of foreign funds.
According to the ED, the adjudicating authority, after a detailed examination of records, evidence, and submissions of the noticees, held that the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) amounting to about ₹9.59 crore was received during 2018-19 by misrepresenting the nature of business activity in statutory filings, thereby bypassing prescribed sectoral conditions and entry route requirements under FEMA.
“Foreign inward remittances aggregating to ₹82.63 crore, purportedly received between 2018-19 to 2023-24 towards export of services, were found to be in contravention of FEMA provisions due to misclassification of exports and failure to comply with mandatory reporting requirements, including submission of SOFTEX forms,” it said.
The adjudicating authority found that the transactions were deliberately structured in a manner that defeated the objectives of the foreign exchange regulatory framework. “Prabir Purkayastha, the director of the company, was found to be in charge of and responsible for the conduct of business at the relevant time and was therefore held liable under Section 42 of FEMA,” said the ED.
“The adjudicating authority observed that the contraventions were substantial, deliberate, and systemic in nature, involving large-scale foreign exchange transactions and breach of statutory declarations furnished to regulatory authorities. Therefore, in exercise of powers under Section 13(1) of FEMA, the following penalties have been imposed by the adjudicating authority (FEMA): ₹120 crore on PPK Newsclick Studio Pvt. Ltd.; ₹64 crore on Prabir Purkayastha, director of the company,” it said.
In February 2021, the ED had searched the premises of Mr. Purkayastha and the Newsclick office.

Deputy Floor Leader of BRS Legislature Party T. Harish Rao has alleged that the Congress and BJP have proved one more time as to how far they could go for power as their unholy nexus after the elections to municipalities and municipal corporations helped them capture positions of authority such as municipal chairperson, mayor and their deputies.
The two parties have abandoned their ideologies, agenda and flags in the thirst for power at local bodies’ level and subverted the mandate given by the people, he said in a statement here on Monday. For the last 12 years, the Congress party called BRS the BJP’s B-team and BJP called BRS the B-team of Congress. However, the two parties exposed themselves during the elections to municipal chairperson, vice chairperson, mayor and deputy mayor positions.
The “fevicol bond” of Congress and BJP was on display as their common objective was to keep BRS away from holding key positions in some of the urban local bodies (ULBs), where people had voted for the latter (BRS). “While they fight in Delhi, they are shaking hands and sharing power locally. The results in Aliabad, Amangal, Metpally, Medak and Narsapur municipalities stand as clear evidence”, Mr. Harish Rao explained.
Mr. Harish Rao observed that the fear of growing public support for BRS had driven both the national parties to script the conspiracies. Even in municipalities where BRS had won the majority wards, Congress and BJP had colluded to capture chairperson posts. In Narsapur, Congress took the chairperson post and handed over the vice-chairperson post to the BJP.
The same pattern was seen in Sirpur-Kagaznagar and Metpally, where Congress and BJP shared chairperson and vice-chairperson posts. In Aliabad, Congress secured the chairperson post with the support of BJP’s three councillors, in Metpally, the Congress extended support to ensure that the BJP captured power, whereas in Amangal an understanding between Congress and BJP decided the outcome.
In municipalities such as Kathanapally, Thorrur, Jangaon and Zaheerabad too BRS had secured majority wards, but in vain due to the Congress-BJP unholy nexus.

Telangana is seeking to position itself as one of the five regional medical tourism hubs announced by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the recent Union Budget, with the State government engaging with the Centre to figure out the guidelines and secure its inclusion, IT and Industries Minister D. Sridhar Babu said in Hyderabad on Monday, February 16.
Addressing TALHealthFest 2026, the Minister said the announcement was only a few weeks’  old and discussions were underway with the Union government to figure out the framework for the proposed hubs. He said Telangana was confident of its prospects, citing the strength of its public and private healthcare institutions and the steady inflow of international patients seeking treatment in the State.
Noting that thousands of patients, particularly from the Middle East and other countries, already travel to Telangana for medical care, Mr. Sridhar Babu said the State’s medical tourism policy would help standardise services and project Telangana as a reliable global healthcare destination. He also outlined plans to develop a dedicated health city as part of the upcoming Future City project, envisaged as an integrated ecosystem bringing together hospitals, research institutions and allied services.
Sai Gundavelli, Chief Executive Officer of Touch-A-Life Foundation, said the organisation was leveraging technology to expand access to healthcare where it was needed most. He said the TALHospitals initiative connected underserved patients with hospitals offering pro bono care, demonstrating that healthcare solutions could be both global and local.
Speaking at the event, Karnataka Minister for Science and Technology N. S. Boseraju said investments in science and technology were critical to solving global challenges. He said technology could enable people in rural areas to access world-class healthcare and added that platforms such as TALHealthFest were important in advancing India’s ambition to emerge as a global innovation leader.
Govinda Hari, founder of the Association of Healthcare Providers of India and president of AHPI Telangana, said that in the post-COVID period, partnerships between governments, non-profits and hospitals were essential to expand both quality and access in healthcare.

The new members of the Parliament of Bangladesh will be sworn in at 10 a.m. Tuesday (February 17, 2026), the Election Commission of Bangladesh has announced adding that a “Constitution Reform Commission” will also be administered oath. This event will be followed by the formation of the government in the afternoon when the Cabinet led by BNP Chairman Tarique Rahman will be sworn in. Around 1,200 local and foreign guests will participate in the swearing-in ceremony of Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s chairman and his Cabinet on Tuesday (February 17, 2026) afternoon, the media wing of the BNP has announced.
The announcement of swearing-in of both MPs alongside members of “Constitution Reform Commission” has surprised many newly elected MPs. Speaking to The Hindu, a newly elected MP said that the EC of Bangladesh had not informed the MPs about the swearing-in of the Constitution Reform Commission. Acccording to a version, the entire parliament will work as a “Constitution Reform Commission” for 180 days as an outcome of the referendum that got majority ‘yes’ vote on February 12, 2026 and as a result all MPs will be sworn in as the member of the Constitution Reform Commission as well. There is evident unease within the newly-elected MPs especially from the BNP, about the process in which the tasks of the Constitution Reform Commission and the parliamentary duties of MPs will unfold.
Among those who have confirmed to attend the swearing-in ceremony of the incoming government are Prime Minister of Bhutan, Tshering Tobgay, Speaker of Lok Sabha Om Birla and Pakistan’s Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal. The foreign minister of the interim government of Nepal Bala Nanda Sharma, and Sri Lanka’s health minister Nalinda Jayatissa will also attend the event. Multiple other countries including Qatar, Malaysia and Brunei will send high level delegates to the swearing in ceremony.
Seema Malhotra, Indo-Pacific Under Secretary of the United Kingdom will represent the UK at the event and the President of the Maldives Mohamed Muizzu is expected to attend as well. Apart from that heads of multiple diplomatic missions based in Dhaka will also attend the event that will be held in the premises of Bangladesh’s parliament – Jatiyo Sansad.
The swearing-in ceremony of the BNP government will mark the end of the interim government led by Chief Adviser Mohammed Yunus that had taken charge after the fall of the Awami League government led by Sheikh Hasina. Prof. Yunus delivered a farewell speech at the Chief Adviser’s Office on Monday evening (February 16, 2026). The Chief Adviser had taken charge on August 8, 2024 and he presided over the last meeting of the Advisory Council on Monday (February 16, 2026).
“The election was not just a process to handover power. It was the election that marked the beginning of new Bangladesh,” said Prof. Yunus in a speech delivered in the evening on state-owned BTV saying that the police in Bangladesh no longer tortures common people.
“We have to ensure that never again fascism raises its head in our country. That is why interim government prioritised institutional reforms,” said Prof. Yunus further. One of the major projects of the interim government was the drafting ofhte July Charter that was adopted by a large spectrum of political parties on October 17, 2017. The National Citizen Party which is in the opposition as part of the 11-party alliance led by Jamaat-e-Islami had not signed the Charter earlier, however, the party signed the July Charter on Monday evening (February 16, 2026). “Interim government’s biggest work is the July Charter. People have hugely supported the July Charter in the referendum. I call upon all political parties to ensure that the July Charter is adopted,” said Prof. Yunus.

After months of promotion as India’s flagship artificial intelligence event, the five-day AI Impact Summit was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday (February 16, 2026), drawing overwhelming crowds and packing Bharat Mandapam to capacity as thousands thronged the venue.
Officials had widely publicised the summit, hosting pre-event programmes across several Indian cities and abroad. Those efforts appeared to pay off on Monday, with nearly every accessible part of the sprawling 100-acre complex filled with attendees. The dozen or so panel discussion venues were left with standing room only.
India AI Summit 2026 LIVE
“We have more than 2.5 lakh registrations,” Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) Secretary S. Krishnan said on the sidelines. “We’ve tried to make all the arrangements that we can; we never anticipated that there would be so many people willing and wanting to attend, which is why we did not restrict the registrations.” The government did not provide overall attendance figures. Entry to the event is free upon registration, and visitor passes have been oversubscribed, Mr. Krishnan said.
The summit featured over 100 events, excluding those that were not livestreamed. In the long exhibition hall complex, over 400 booths were active, spanning industry, academia, startups, and global tech giants.
However, the event was not without hitches—many attendees complained online about overcrowding, long queues at food courts, where some vendors reportedly refused digital payments. Some outlets ran out of ingredients and couldn’t restock quickly enough to meet demands. Some visitors said drinking water was difficult to access.

In the afternoon, parts of the venue were cleared for security sanitisation, leading to exhibitors being asked to vacate at short notice. One exhibitor complained online that wearable devices brought for display were stolen.  Access to several areas was also restricted later in the day, resulting in long queues at entry and exit points.
There were, however, some novel arrangements. A quick-commerce platform set up grocery and snack drop-off points across Bharat Mandapam, while an online food ordering and delivery company facilitated food deliveries within the complex. Digi Yatra, typically used for expedited airport entry, was piloted at entry gates, enabling attendees to use facial recognition for automated access.
In a post on X in the morning, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, “The AI Impact Summit will enrich global discourse on diverse aspects of AI, such as innovation, collaboration, responsible use and more. I am confident that the outcomes of the summit will help shape a future that is progressive, innovative and opportunity-driven.”
Later in the afternoon, Mr. Modi visited the exhibition area, posting on X afterward that it was “a matter of immense pride for us that people from all over the world are coming to India for the India AI Impact Summit,” and that the “occasion is further proof that our country is progressing rapidly in the field of science and technology and is making an important contribution to global development.”
Mr. Modi is scheduled to address the plenary session on Thursday, when the event will be closed to general visitors. Keynote speakers that day include OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Microsoft president Brad Smith, and Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis.
While NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang’s highly anticipated visit was cancelled over the weekend, it is unclear if there were any other cancellations. Former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates was pulled from an online speakers’ list, but officials did not respond to queries on whether Mr. Gates, who was in Amaravati earlier on Monday, would finally attend.

On February 4, President’s Rule was revoked in Manipur and a new Chief Minister, Yumnam Khemchand Singh, was sworn in, along with two deputies — Losii Dikho, a Naga, and Nemcha Kipgen, a Kuki-Zo. Mr. Dikho, from the Naga People’s Front, an alliance partner of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), speaks about the priorities of the new government.
Edited excerpts:
It has been over 10 days since the swearing-in ceremony of the Chief Minister and the two Deputy CMs, including you, took place. Why is the full Cabinet not in place and why have portfolios not been allocated yet?
The portfolios will be allocated after the full Cabinet is expanded. I spoke to the Chief Minister, and he agreed with me.
When is it expected?
It should not take much time. And of course, it has to be coordinated with the Centre.
You were the chief guest at a football match organised by the Zomi Council last week at Churachandpur. What was the outcome?
It was a fruitful trip. The nine tribes under the nomenclature Zomi had organised the event. I had a closed-door meeting with all the tribe leaders, the president, and all of them strongly supported the formation of the government. They invited me again for another festival on February 20.
After the ethnic violence between Meitei and Kuki-Zo people erupted on May 3,2023, more than 60,000 people were displaced from their homes. What is the new government’s strategy to rehabilitate them?
This is a priority. Money has been distributed among the people and additional money has been provided to the displaced people who are moving back to their homes.
The Litan area in Ukhrul district has witnessed clashes and arson between the Kuki and Naga communities over the past two weeks? How is the situation now and what is the government’s strategy?
The issue is not between all Nagas and Kukis. Few members of Tangkhul Nagas and Kukis were involved. But we cannot keep silent and we intervened and involved the United Naga Council and the head of the Tangkhul tribe; we joined hands. The land dispute between the two communities should be settled and the land ownership and agreement has to be worked out. Both communities have come to an understanding and stopped the fight but till now no agreement has been signed. But it is almost under control. Naga people do not want to have these tensions any more, but the landowners have to be recognised
The other Deputy CM, Nemcha Kipgen, a Kuki-Zo, has not been able to travel to Imphal yet. So how is the government functioning and how are the three of you communicating?
She is at present at her home in Kangpokpi, and every day, we speak on the phone. She is supporting us to reach the people as she cannot come to Imphal. We do virtual video meetings. So far, two Cabinet meetings under the Chief Minister have taken place where she participated through a video call.
What about the free movement of all vehicles and people from all communities on National Highway-2? It hasn’t started yet.
I have spoken to the Deputy CM and our second plan is that we will have a Cabinet meeting in Senapati (Naga area) next. The CM told her that we will go to Senapati by road via Kangpokpi (Kuki-Zo area, NH-2 passes through here) and that we have to reach out to people. As the new government has been installed, there is a good response from all the communities. I reached out to the Thadou people in Kangpokpi, and they have invited me to attend the church on Sunday. It is a positive sign.

Elections for municipal chairperson and vice-chairperson posts turned chaotic, triggering clashes among supporters of the ruling Congress and Opposition BRS, BJP, and others in many places in the State on Monday. Ironically, the ruling Congress and its rival BJP reportedly joined hands to secure the chairperson and vice-chairperson posts through a ‘sharing system’, while BRS and Congress also reportedly entered into an understanding to grab the posts.
Of the 112 urban local bodies — whose results of indirect elections were declared on Monday (February 16, 2026) — Congress secured 86 Chairperson or Mayor posts, followed by BRS with 18, 2 by BJP, one each by CPI and AIFB, and four by independent candidates.
However, authorities postponed elections in 11 civic bodies due to disputes, protests, lack of quorum, and allegations of political interference. The postponed municipalities include Thorrur, Yellandu, Sultanabad, Ibrahimpatnam, Kagaznagar, Kyatanapalli, Khanapur, Zaheerabad, Indresham, Dornakal and Jangaon.
Heated scenes prevailed at Thorrur town in Mahabubabad district as Warangal Congress MP Kadiyam Kavya and Palakurthi Congress MLA M. Yashaswini Reddy registered themselves as ex-officio members, which was objected to by the BRS who alleged that Dr. Kavya was an ex-officio member in the  Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation (GWMC). The dispute quickly escalated into slogan-shouting and scuffles between party cadres, forcing authorities to postpone the election to Tuesday.
At Ibrahimpatnam in Rangareddy district, Dornakal in Mahabubabad and Yellandu in Bhadradri-Kothagudem, elections of chairperson and vice-chairperson were deferred due to ‘lack of quorum’, as several members skipped the oath-taking ceremonies.
Elections were delayed in Sultanabad in Peddapalli district, Indresham in Sangareddy district and Kyantanpalli in Mancherial district because parties failed to finalise candidates or due to lack of quorum.
With both Congress, including CPM ally, and BRS tied at 13 seats each, ex-officio votes of Bhuvanagiri Congress MP Chamala Kiran Kumar Reddy and Jangaon BRS MLA Palla Rajeswara Reddy brought the tally to another 14-14 deadlock in Jangaon Municipality.
Independents became decisive, prompting allegations of councillor kidnapping. Police stopped vehicles of BRS councillors, triggering a heated argument between MLA Palla Rajeshwar Reddy and senior police officials. Elections were postponed amid the standoff.
BRS senior MLA and former minister T. Harish Rao made a scathing attack on Congress and BJP, alleging that the two parties had compromised ideologies and joined hands solely to block BRS from power. He cited instances in Narsapur, Aliabad, Metpally, Amangal, and other municipalities where Congress and BJP allegedly shared chairperson and vice-chairperson posts.
In Aliabad of Medchal-Malkajgiri district, Congress secured the chairperson post with BJP support in the 20-member body, while Independent councillor Bandari Anusha was elected chairperson with backing from Congress, BRS, AIMIM, and independents in Adilabad.
In Bhainsa, independent councillor T. Dattatri won with support from the BJP, AIMIM, and Congress. In Nirmal, Congress captured power, with Appala Kavya elected chairperson and her husband Appala Ganesh as vice-chairperson.

The resounding victory of Congress in the civic polls across the State reflects the trust people reposed in the transparent governance, developmental initiatives and welfare schemes being implemented by the State government, said Deputy Chief Minister Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka.
He was speaking to mediapersons along with the newly elected Madhira Municipal Chairperson S. Sujatha and Vice-Chairperson K. Dhanikumar of the Congress after their unanimous election in Madhira town on Monday.
He said the State government has formulated plans to transform Telangana into a three trillion-dollar economy by 2047. Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy is personally monitoring municipal administration responsibilities to ensure comprehensive urban development.
The government is implementing the ‘Cure-Pure-Rare’ policy framework aimed at improving accountability in municipal governance and enhancing citizens’ quality of life, he added.
Mr. Vikramarka reiterated that the government would accelerate development and welfare programmes further, honouring the trust placed in it by the people.

The election of Mayors and Chairpersons in 116 Municipalities and 7 Municipal Corporations in Telangana has marked a decisive moment for women’s political participation, with women emerging as a dominant force across urban local bodies.
From municipal corporations to municipalities, women not only benefited from statutory reservations but also translated electoral opportunity into political authority, reshaping the leadership profile in urban Telangana.
Out of the seven municipal corporations that went to polls in the State, three mayoral posts were reserved for women, and significantly, all the women mayors belong to the Congress, underlining the party’s overwhelming dominance.
Caste-wise too, the mayoral posts reflected a broad social spread. Out of the seven Mayor posts, three were reserved for women, and one each for the Scheduled Caste (SC) and the Scheduled Tribes (ST) categories. Among these, women held two unreserved (women) and one BC (women) mayoral seats.
The most striking impact of women’s participation was visible at the municipality level. Of the 116 chairpersons, 30 were in the unreserved category, 16 were in the BC, 7 were under SC, and two were in the ST categories.  Among these, at least 60 were held by women, 55 through women-reserved seats and five additional women elected in the general seats so far. This meant that women occupied more than half of all municipality chairpersonships, a rare milestone in Telangana’s civic politics.
Combining corporations and municipalities, Telangana has 123 head posts (mayors and chairpersons). Women account for at least 63 of these, in addition to at least 11 deputy-level posts (including deputy mayors and vice-chairpersons). However, this number might increase as 11 municipalities will go for elections tomorrow.
Party-wise in all categories, the Congress dominated the landscape with 86 head posts, followed by Bharat Rashtra Samithi with 18, the Bharatiya Janata Party (2), Independents (4), CPI (1) and AIFB (1).
Importantly, 100% women mayor posts went to the Congress. The Congress secured mayoral posts in Mahabubnagar, Mancherial, Nalgonda, Nizamabad and Ramagundam, while the BJP won Karimnagar, and the Communist Party of India captured Kothagudem in alliance with Congress.
Yet, among these, only Congress-led corporations saw women at the top. Districts such as Nalgonda, Yadadri Bhongir, Khammam and Sangareddy reported particularly high numbers of women heading municipalities.

Faced with charges of alleged high-handedness against devotees during the Mahasivaratri festival at Srikalahasti temple, the Police Department has brushed aside the charges and pointed out that the act became necessary to restore order and was in the interests of the devotees.
It may be recalled that a large number of ‘Siva Swamis’, who tried to carry the idol proceeding on ‘Nandi Vahanam’ on their shoulders, were prevented by the police from doing so, as it could lead to a chaos.
The incident, however, went viral on social media, where the police was seen resorting to ‘lathi charge’ on the devotees carrying the idol.
Meanwhile, the Tirupati district police pointed out that the ‘Siva Swamis’ had behaved in an undisciplined manner and tried to snatch the carrier (Vahanam) by force, leading to the carrier tilting to one side.
“The act could have potentially led to a chaotic situation and our police persons responded in time to restore order, thus saving the devotees from imminent injury,” Superintendent of Police (SP) L. Subbarayudu said.
After the news spread on social media on a negative light, the police department appealed to the devotees not to get carried away by the frivolous charge. In the same vein, Mr. Subbarayudu also warned the miscreants of serious action for making baseless allegations against the department.

--------------------
K. Ponmudy
The Madras High Court on Wednesday decided to hear after a fortnight a writ petition filed by former DMK Minister K. Ponmudy, who had challenged an assessment order passed by the Income Tax (I-T) department in December 2022, after coming to a conclusion that an illegal payment of ₹20 lakh had been made to him by SRS Mining owned by J. Sekar Reddy and two other partners.
Justice C. Saravanan directed the High Court Registry to print the name of I-T department senior standing counsel A.P. Srinivas in the causelist and list the case after two weeks. The former Minister had filed the writ petition in January 2023 challenging the assessment order passed by an Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax and a consequent notice of demand issued on December 22, 2022.
On January 30, 2023, Justice Abdul Quddhose had passed an interim order restraining the I-T department from taking coercive steps against the former Minister until further orders from the court and granted time for the department to file its counter affidavit. The interim relief was granted after being prima facie convinced with the submissions made by senior counsel P. Wilson representing the writ petitioner.
The senior counsel had told the court that the I-T department had issued multiple show cause notices before passing the assessment order. While responding to those notices, the petitioner had requested the department to share with him the evidence to prove that he had received an illegal payment of ₹20 lakh from SRS Mining. However, the department was unable to share any  evidence, he claimed.
Mr. Wilson had also drawn the attention of the court to the fact that though the petitioner had requested the I-T department to permit him to cross examine the partners of SRS Mining, which had allegedly made the illegal payment to him, the department had refused to accede to his request. The denial of opportunity to cross examine the company representatives was arbitrary and illegal, he had argued.
The court was also told that the demand made in the show cause notices was only for a sum of ₹20 lakh but in the final assessment order, the tax liability, along with interest, had been arbitrarily increased to ₹78.33 lakh. Therefore, the petitioner urged the court to quash the assessment order as well as the consequent notice of demand issued to him by the Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax.

--------------------
The Maharashtra government has directed the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to offer a permanent post of Class 2 officer to Asawari Jagdale, daughter of Santosh Jagdale who was killed in the Pahalgam terror attack last year.
Sources said the Chief Minister’s office called twice to speed up her appointment. Chief Minister Devendra Fadanavis was personally tracking the matter. Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde later directed the civic administration to appoint her at the earliest.
Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde had earlier met the Jagdale family in Pune and assured them of government employment for Asawari. On Monday, He spoke to Pune Municipal Commissioner Naval Kishore Ram and directed that a post equivalent to her education be created. He also spoke to Asawari and said the appointment would be approved as a special matter.
The process to induct her into government service will be completed soon.
The move came after reports of financial distress and disappointment due to a delay of around 10 months in providing the government job promised on February 15.
Twenty-six-year-old Asawari Jagdale approached the Union government seeking intervention. She said the family has been facing hardship since her father was killed by terrorists on April 22 last year. She said she left her private sector job to support her mother.
In a letter to the Modi government, she wrote that her family was struggling financially and was being made to run around for a job.
After the attack, efforts were made to provide employment to Asawari. To avoid delays in government procedures, she was offered an option at a private university. The Chief Minister personally spoke to the university, but the family declined, said sources.
She was later offered a job at PMRDM, though her preference was the Pune Municipal Corporation.
The PMC can provide Class 3 or Class 4 posts at its level. As a special case, it sent a proposal to the state government to grant her a Class 2 post. Action on the proposal is under way.
Congress leader Supriya Shrinate criticised the BJP government. In a post on X, she said that although the state had promised a job after Santosh Jagdale was martyred in the Pahalgam attack, it had now turned its face away.
“Santosh Jagdale’s daughter wrote a letter to the Modi government describing the situation. In the terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Maharashtra’s Jagdale ji was martyred, the state government had promised his daughter a government job. But, as always, they have now turned their face away," read her post on X.
On November 26, 2008, during the terrorist attacks in Mumbai, Police Sub-Inspector Prakash Pandurang More was martyred while confronting terrorists. His daughter, Anushka More, was appointed on compassionate grounds.

--------------------
The India AI Impact Summit 2026 is facing multiple waves of cyber threats from foreign-based attackers prompting a serious alert across Indian security agencies.
Owing to this, a senior cyber security officer overseeing summit operations said a G20-grade shield has been activated till the event ends on February 20.
According to the authorities, one of the most serious risks is the misuse of social media and deepfake technology to manipulate or fabricate statements by world leaders, potentially spreading false narratives within minutes.
The authorities said cyber teams are closely monitoring online platforms to prevent disinformation campaigns linked to the summit, which was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday (February 16). As per sources, the alert states that government websites are under threat and can be targeted through “watering hole attacks" in which hackers attempt to exploit vulnerabilities to silently plant malware.
Officials said summit communications also face threats from session and token hijacking, rogue “Evil Twin" WiFi hotspots, and data theft operations aimed at delegates and affiliated social media accounts. As per the inputs, cybercriminals are simultaneously preparing ransomware attacks against critical infrastructure, while distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) strikes are intended to overwhelm digital public platforms and disrupt services.
Investigators suspect high-powered brute-force attempts could be executed by advanced computing capabilities, targeting network hardware such as video conferencing systems, routers and switches. Security agencies have also warned of infected USB storage devices being used to infiltrate computers and quietly spread malware across organisations.
In a further escalation, foreign-based threat actors are exploiting outdated or vulnerable routers used by internet service providers turning them into proxy networks to launch attacks on Indian IT infrastructure.
A G20-grade, multi-layered, defence framework is fully operational now, with the system engineered to withstand thousands of attack attempts per minute.
This cyber shield includes mandatory multi-factor authentication, real-time patch management, disabled USB autorun, restricted user privileges, continuous backups and ongoing vulnerability and penetration testing audits across summit systems.
The umbrella system has multiple cyber security experts, teams of private players and groups of analysts. Officials indicated India’s experience hosting the G20 Summit, during which agencies neutralised more than 1.6 million cyberattack attempts without a breach. That infrastructure and operational playbook have now been expanded to safeguard the AI summit.

India was hailed as a global leader in artificial intelligence at the ‘India AI Impact Summit 2026’, which was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday.
The landmark summit, which will end on February 20, signals India’s commitment to shaping AI solutions for the global stage.
After the inauguration at New Delhi’s Bharat Mandapam, Modi shared moments from the event on his social media and said being amongst researchers and tech enthusiasts provided a “glimpse of the extraordinary potential of AI, Indian talent and innovation". He said India’s efforts will “shape solutions not just for India but for the world" as the nation advances its vision of Viksit Bharat.
“Inaugurated the India AI Impact Expo 2026 at Bharat Mandapam. Being here among innovators, researchers and tech enthusiasts gives a glimpse of the extraordinary potential of AI, Indian talent and innovation. Together, we will shape solutions not just for India but for the world!"

The India AI Impact Summit garnered widespread praise from international experts, who view India as a global leader dedicated to using AI as a transformative force for public good and economic development.
Gabriela Ramos, former UNESCO assistant director general, lauded the summit’s focus on tangible results. She said while technology is evolving daily, the real question lies in its impact on sectors like education and healthcare.
“I feel that the AI Impact Summit is putting the emphasis on the impact. I’m very glad because we have been focusing too much on the technologies, which is great, because these technologies have capacities that are evolving by the day, either generative or agentic. Each time they do more cognitive tasks that were just reserved for humans. But this time we’re looking at the impacts.  And that’s what we need to do," Ramos said.

Praising the shift towards a human-based approach, she added: “If we apply these technologies for school, are the students learning? If we apply it for health, are the patients recovering better? I feel that this is the real question that we are now to answer here. It’s not about how we develop these technologies in a more human-based approach, but also how we deploy it and how we use it to solve our problems…"
Other experts stressed that AI must be “safe by default". Cynthia McCaffrey, UNICEF India representative, said while it offers a “tremendous opportunity" to expand horizons for children and educators, protections and guardrails must be built in from the design phase rather than as an afterthought.
“The way that UNICEF is looking at AI, and I believe the Government of India is seeing this as well, is that AI is a tremendous opportunity to expand horizons, to open opportunities about how children can learn the type of knowledge that teachers and parents and others can have access to. At the same time, to also look at how you have to build in the protections from the beginning," McCaffrey said.

She said this sentiment aligns with India’s broader strategy of ensuring AI improves the quality of life while remaining anchored in ethical principles.
“It’s important to identify those guardrails and those regulations that governments can put in place that industry can think about as they design AI because the opportunities are huge but you have to think about the protections at the beginning… One of the things that  UNICEF is saying and advocating for with many others is that AI should be safe by default, shouldn’t be an afterthought…" she added.
According to an official release, the India AI Impact Summit 2026 is defined by several key developments that position the country at the centre of the global technological discourse.
Here’s all you need to know:
With an AI market projected to surpass $17 billion by 2027, India is using this summit to declare its intent to bridge the gap between innovation and global impact. As the event continues, the focus will firmly remain on harnessing AI to solve human challenges across both rural and urban landscapes.

--------------------
The Enforcement Directorate has imposed a Rs 184 crore fine against news portal NewsClick, and its editor-in-chief, Prabir Purkayastha, under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), news agency PTI reported, citing official sources.
As per the order, PPK NewsClick Studio Private Limited, the company that owns the portal, has been fined Rs 120 crore, while Purkayastha has been issued a separate penalty of Rs 64 crore for alleged violations.
The entities have been found “contravening" FEMA provisions on two counts — alleged misrepresentation of foreign direct investment (FDI) funds and misdeclaration of services and exports, sources told the news agency.
A response from NewsClick on the development is awaited.
The ED had first conducted searches at the portal’s premises in the Saidulajab area of the national capital in September 2021 in connection with a money laundering probe. The agency has since recorded statements of more than 25 individuals, including Purkayastha.
In 2023, the BJP cited a report by The New York Times to allege wrongdoing by the portal and its promoters. The report had claimed that NewsClick was part of a global network that received funding from American billionaire Neville Roy Singham, who allegedly has links with Chinese government media entities.
Founded in 2009, NewsClick describes itself on its website as an independent media organisation focusing on news coverage from India and abroad, particularly progressive movements.

A man, who appeared to be intoxicated, was caught sleeping on railway tracks at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) in Mumbai on Monday afternoon, briefly disrupting Harbour Line train services.
The incident took place around 3.30 pm just as a train was pulling into the Harbour Line track. Avinash Prakash Kardile (19), who collects trash on the tracks, suddenly lay down and covered himself with a white cloth, apparently expecting the train to run him over, an official said.
Commuters shouted and waved to alert him as the train slowed and honked repeatedly. The man remained unfazed and continued sleeping. A video of the incident has gone viral on social media.

--------------------
The Karnataka High Court on Monday declared the election of Congress MLA SN Subbareddy in 2023 from the Bagepalli constituency invalid and void.
The verdict came on a petition filed by BJP candidate C Muniraju, who had approached the court alleging that Subbareddy indulged in election malpractices.
According to the petition, Subbareddy filed incorrect nomination papers and concealed details regarding his assets and liabilities during the filing process. The High Court accepted the arguments and ruled in favour of the petitioner.
The court has also issued notices to the Election Commission of India and the Vidhan Soudha secretary in connection with the matter. Further proceedings are expected based on their responses.
A Bench headed by Justice M.G.S. Kamal passed the order after hearing detailed arguments from both sides and examining reports submitted by the authorities. The court directed that a copy of the order be sent to the Election Commission and the Secretary of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly.
The case was heard over nearly two years. In his petition, Muniraju sought two remedies — the annulment of Subba Reddy’s election and a declaration naming himself as the winner from Bagepalli. The High Court partly allowed the plea by setting aside Subba Reddy’s election but refused to recognise Muniraju as the returned candidate.
Subba Reddy maintained that the case was politically motivated and claimed there was a conspiracy against him. After the verdict, his counsel sought a stay on the order to allow them to approach the Supreme Court in appeal, but the High Court declined to grant any relief.
Reacting to the judgment, Muniraju said he had approached the court with full faith in the judiciary and described the order as a victory for justice. He stated that the verdict had strengthened public confidence in the judicial system and was the result of effective presentation of arguments before the court.
Apart from the affidavit-related allegations, Muniraju also cited claims that Subba Reddy was facing accusations in connection with an alleged scam.

TITLE: ‘No Good Ground To Interfere’: NGT Clears Great Nicobar Project, Cites Strategic Importance
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/no-good-ground-to-interfere-ngt-clears-great-nicobar-project-cites-strategic-importance-ws-l-9907414.html
--------------------
A six-member special bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Monday cleared the way for the Great Nicobar Island mega infrastructure project, holding that it found “no good ground to interfere" with the project’s Environment Clearance.
The Rs 80,000 crore project involves an international container transshipment terminal, an international airport, a power plant, and a township over an area of 166.10 sq km, of which 130.75 sq km is forest and 84.10 sq km tribal land.
The Eastern Zone Bench in Kolkata, headed by Justice Prakash Shrivastava, disposed of a batch of petitions challenging the environment clearance granted in November 2022. The NGT also directed authorities and regulatory agencies to ensure “full and strict compliance" with the environment clearance conditions.
“We find that adequate safeguards have been provided in the EC conditions and in the first round of litigation the Tribunal had refused to interfere in the EC and remaining issues noted by the Tribunal in the first round of litigation have been dealt with by the High-Powered Committee and considering the strategic importance of the Project and taking into account the other relevant considerations, we do not find any good ground to interfere," the tribunal said in its order.
“The project is very important for India from the strategic point of view," the Tribunal observed, noting that development at such a location must be considered in a balanced manner while ensuring adherence to environmental regulations, including the Island Coastal Regulation Zone (ICRZ) Notification, 2019.
The project was accorded environmental clearance in November 2022, and in-principle forest clearance was granted in October 2022.
The EC was challenged on several environmental grounds. The petition had challenged environmental and Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) clearances granted to the integrated development project, alleging violations of the Island Coastal Regulation Zone (ICRZ) Notification, 2019, including alleged destruction of corals, reliance on single-season Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) data, as well as some part of the project located in the ICRZ-IA area, classified as ecologically-sensitive.
Senior environmental activist Ashish Kothari had filed two main pleas before NGT. Kothari argued that 57 hectares of port area, 60 hectares of airport area, 81 hectares of township for defence, and 503 hectares of other township should be excluded from the project plans because they fell within ICRZ areas, where development was prohibited.
Petitioners argued that the terms of reference given to the HPC were “truncated and factually incorrect," and that broader environmental issues had not been properly examined. They also sought public disclosure of the HPC’s report.
In 2023, the NGT had constituted a High-Powered Committee under the Union Environment Ministry Secretary to revisit certain aspects of the clearance, particularly relating to–Protection of coral colonies, Nesting sites of leatherback turtles, and Allegations that parts of the project fell within ecologically protected zones.
However, the tribunal held that the committee had adequately dealt with the issues and found no error in its terms of reference. It also accepted the Union government’s submission that the HPC report contained “strategic, defence and national importance" information and therefore could not be made public.
On concerns relating to coral reefs, the NGT held that no major coral reefs exist within the direct project site, as per the reports of the Zoological Survey of India and the High-Powered Committee. It also accepted the committee’s finding that one-season (non-monsoon) Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) data was sufficient for port projects, and stated that no construction falls within ecologically sensitive ICRZ-IA areas, based on the ground verification by the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM).
It noted that plans were underway for translocation of coral colonies as recommended by the Zoological Survey of India.
The Tribunal directed the Environment Ministry to prepare and approve an implementation plan for coral protection and regeneration, suggesting the involvement of scientific agencies such as the Zoological Survey of India and the National Institute of Oceanography.
Environmentalists have consistently raised concerns over the project, which lies in one of India’s most ecologically fragile ecosystems, and is a key biodiversity site.

--------------------
The damaged black box has been recovered from the January 28 plane crash that killed Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister and NCP leader Ajit Pawar and four others, sources told CNN-News18 on Monday.
Top sources in the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) said that, unlike the Air India crash, the aircraft involved in Pawar’s case has yielded its black box. However, it was found in a burnt condition and will need further technical examination.
Sources said the government is expected to take a decision within the next one or two days, and it is likely that the damaged black box will be sent overseas for specialised data recovery.
Meanwhile, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has begun a parallel investigation into the aircraft’s airworthiness and operational condition. The probe is expected to take 10 to 15 days, as investigators review a large number of documents recovered from the operating company.
Officials said the findings of both the black box analysis and the DGCA inquiry will be crucial in determining the cause of the crash and the next course of action.
Pawar died in the plane crash on January 28 near Baramati in Pune district, along with Captain Sumit Kapoor, co-pilot Captain Shambhavi Pathak, Personal Security Officer Vidip Jadhav, and flight attendant Pinky Mali. The chartered Learjet 45 crashed while attempting to land at Baramati airport.
The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) and the DGCA are probing the incident. Authorities have not yet released details about the cause of the crash, and officials said the investigation is ongoing.

--------------------
Cleanliness has long been one of the biggest complaints during train journeys. Now, Indian Railways is turning to Artificial Intelligence (AI) to tackle this issue more systematically and transparently.
Speaking to News18 India, Chief Project Engineer Lakshman Jain said that AI will now supervise cleanliness work inside trains. As part of a pilot project, AI-based cleaning monitoring has already begun in 100 trains across the country.
Recently, Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw stated that the level of cleanliness usually seen in AC First Class coaches will now be ensured in general class coaches as well.
Lakshman Jain explained the process in detail. When cleaning staff board a train, they must first upload their photograph on a designated mobile application to mark their presence.
Before starting the cleaning work, the staff are required to take a photograph of the toilet and upload it on the app. After completing the cleaning, they must click another photograph and upload it again.
Once the images are uploaded, the AI system analyses both the ‘before’ and ‘after’ photographs to assess whether the toilet has been cleaned according to the required standards.
If the AI system finds that the cleaning does not meet the prescribed quality benchmarks, it can issue a warning to the concerned staff. In serious cases, it also has the authority to recommend or impose a fine.
Through this AI-driven monitoring mechanism, Indian Railways aims to bring greater accountability and ensure improved cleanliness standards across all classes of travel.

--------------------
A young bank employee from Haryana was found murdered late Sunday night after her throat was allegedly slit while she was travelling with her husband, prompting a police investigation into the circumstances surrounding her death.
The victim, identified as Mahak, was a resident of Hansi and worked at HDFC Bank in Gurugram. According to initial reports, she was travelling to Gurugram by car with her husband, Anshul, on Sunday evening when the incident occurred between Hansi and Badli. Police said the husband himself informed authorities about the killing around 11 pm on February 15.
Mahak, who was reportedly pregnant, is suspected to have been attacked on the neck with a pair of scissors. Her body was later taken to Bahadurgarh Civil Hospital for post-mortem examination. Police are currently probing the case, and her husband is being treated as the prime suspect at this stage, though officials say all angles are being examined.
The couple had an arranged marriage in September last year and were both working in Gurugram, with Anshul employed as a chartered accountant. On February 14, they had visited Hisar for Valentine’s Day and left for Gurugram by car at around 7 pm on Sunday. A few hours later, the incident was reported to the police.
Mahak was the youngest among three siblings. Her father, Krishna Kathuria, runs a vegetable business in Hansi’s local market. Anshul is a resident of Sector 14 in Hisar, and his father, Ramesh Dhawan, works as an accountant in the city’s cloth market. It was Anshul’s father who informed Mahak’s family about the incident late at night.
Police teams reached the spot soon after receiving the call and have launched an investigation to ascertain the exact sequence of events and the motive behind the killing.

The Centre will roll out Bharat-VISTAAR (Virtually Integrated System to Access Agricultural Resources), an AI-driven multilingual platform aimed at delivering farm-related information directly to farmers through mobile phones or a simple voice call, on Tuesday. The initiative will be formally launched in Jaipur by Union Agriculture Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Rajasthan Chief Minister Bhajanlal Sharma.
Designed as a round-the-clock “digital agriculture expert," Bharat-VISTAAR can be accessed in two modes, including via a dedicated helpline number, 155261. Its conversational AI assistant, named Bharati, will guide farmers on crop planning, recommended agricultural practices, pest management, weather updates, market prices, and government schemes. It will also provide details on eligibility, application processes, and grievance redressal, according to a report in The Indian Express.
Farmers will be able to access information on 10 key Central schemes such as PM-KISAN, PM Fasal Bima Yojana, Soil Health Card, Kisan Credit Card, Agriculture Infrastructure Fund and PM Krishi Sinchayee Yojana, among others. Real-time alerts related to weather and pest outbreaks will also be available.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced the initiative in the Union Budget 2026-27, allocating Rs 150 crore for its implementation in the upcoming financial year. She said the platform would integrate AgriStack portals and ICAR’s agricultural practice packages with AI systems to improve productivity, support better decision-making and reduce risks through customised advisory services.
Initially available in Hindi and English, the platform will gradually expand to regional languages. Officials described Bharat-VISTAAR as more than just an application, calling it a “national digital backbone" linking Central and State systems while maintaining state autonomy. The system will collaborate with non-profits, AI startups and Centres of Excellence, leveraging the broader India AI Mission and BHASHINI ecosystem. Farmer feedback will also feed into policymaking and research planning, the report stated.

TITLE: Ex-Assam Congress Chief Bhupen Borah Resigns, Blames Gaurav Gogoi’s 'High-Handedness'
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/ex-assam-congress-chief-bhupen-borah-resigns-blames-gaurav-gogois-high-handedness-9906154.html
--------------------
In a major setback to the Congress ahead of the Assembly polls in Assam, former state unit chief Bhupen Kumar Borah has resigned, according to sources.
Sources said Borah sent his resignation letter to Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge. He also wrote to Rahul Gandhi.
In his letter, Borah said he was being ignored by the party leadership and was not given his due in the state unit. He said he had informed the high command about how the party was functioning in the state and that the situation had affected his self-esteem and dignity.
After his resignation, Borah said, “I sent my resignation to the Congress High Command at 8 am this morning and explained in detail why I was compelled to take this stand. This is not a personal decision. I have given 32 years to the party and joined it in 1994. This principle is not merely personal; it is driven by concern for the party’s future. That is why I conveyed everything in detail to the Congress High Command."
Meanwhile, Gaurav Gogoi has reached Bhupen Borah’s house after the latter tendered his resignation.
Borah blamed the policies, high-handedness and favouritism of Gaurav Gogoi for his decision.
He was president of the Assam Congress from 2021 to 2025 and was replaced by Gogoi last year. Borah is a two-time legislator in Assam.
He was expected to contest from the newly formed Ranganodi constituency. He was also likely to hold talks with Opposition parties to form an alliance. However, the inclusion of MP Rockybul Hussain in the team reportedly caused discontent.
Bora, who previously served as president of the Assam Pradesh Congress Committee, has been one of the most prominent faces of the Congress in the state. His departure is widely seen as a major setback for the party’s prospects, particularly in Upper Assam, where he holds considerable influence. Political observers describe the timing of his resignation, well ahead of candidate announcements, as a calculated move that underscores growing internal dissatisfaction within the Congress ranks.
Sources indicate that Bora is likely to formally join the Bharatiya Janata Party in the coming days, potentially in the presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah. Such a high-profile induction would signal the BJP’s intent to consolidate its position further by absorbing influential leaders from the opposition camp.
Bora is expected to contest the upcoming Assembly elections from the Ranganadi constituency on a BJP ticket. The move is being viewed as a strategic recalibration, as Ranganadi is considered a politically significant seat where Bora’s personal network combined with BJP’s organizational strength could pose a formidable challenge to rivals.
Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma publicly welcomed Bora’s decision, stating that the BJP’s doors are open to leaders who believe in development and strong governance. Sarma further assured that the party would extend full support to ensure Bora’s victory from Ranganadi if he joins, a clear indication that the BJP leadership has already factored him into its electoral strategy.
With this development, the political landscape in Assam appears poised for a fresh realignment. Bora’s exit not only weakens the Congress structurally but also reinforces the narrative of momentum shifting toward the BJP ahead of the high-stakes Assembly battle.

--------------------
Karnataka Minister Priyank Kharge on Sunday accused the RSS of indulging in “money laundering", and also questioned its source of income.
He said that he wants the law and Constitution that is applicable to everyone in the country, should apply to RSS too.
“RSS did not hoist the national flag in their office for 52 years. They teach us about patriotism," Kharge said.
Addressing a gathering at an event here, he said, “It (RSS) has a network of more than 2,500 organisations, they are from America, England. They take money from them. I am telling — that these people are into money laundering."
Questioning as to where the RSS is getting money from and how, he said, “they want us to be good citizens, pay income tax, but they want to remain free. How is it possible. We will have to question this." Later speaking to reporters, while pointing out that RSS is an unregistered organisation, Kharge asked, whether “they are above law or Constitution."
“It is good that all organisations should come under the ambit of law and constitution, whether it is RSS or any other organisations. Are they above law and constitution. Mohan Bhagwat (RSS chief) says it (RSS) is a body of individuals. So is Bangalore Club, have they not registered? Are they not paying taxes?" he further asked.
Stating that his question is why the RSS was unregistered, he said, “Where is their Guru Dakshina (donation) coming from." “Who is paying it? Why is it (RSS) not paying tax? When every rupee of others is being accounted for, why is there no accountability for their (RSS) money," he asked.

--------------------
At the Mahashivratri celebrations at the Isha Yoga Center, spirituality and nation-building converged in a powerful display of devotion, cultural pride and national service. The night-long event on February 15-16, 2026, witnessed the presence of Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, who joined hundreds of thousands of seekers in celebrating what has become one of the world’s largest spiritual gatherings for Mahashivratri.
Addressing the massive congregation, Singh drew a connection between India’s spiritual ethos and its armed forces. Referring to Operation Sindoor, he said, “On one hand, our armed forces provide humanitarian assistance during times of crisis with the spirit of Shiva. On the other, when duty demands, they execute operations like Operation Sindoor with the intensity of Rudra. The spirit within our soldiers comes from our culture, from the inspiration of Lord Shiva." Deeply moved by the atmosphere, he added, “The divinity I am experiencing here makes it clear, even without anyone telling me, that this place is blessed by Mahadeva, the Lord of Lords."
The evening also marked the launch of the Bhavya Bharat Bhushan Awards, instituted by Sadhguru to honour individuals shaping India’s future across diverse fields. Presenting the inaugural awards alongside the Defence Minister, Sadhguru said, “A nation is not just land; a nation is its people. Only when people are truly inspired and committed can we build a great nation – a Bhavya Bharat."
This year’s awardees reflected excellence across disciplines. In Science and Technology, honours went to Nambi Narayanan and K Radhakrishnan for advancing India’s technological frontiers. Classical dancer Alarmel Valli was recognised for preserving India’s artistic heritage, while legendary violinist N Rajam was honoured for enriching the nation’s musical landscape. Historian Vikram Sampath was awarded for illuminating India’s past through scholarship, and badminton icon Saina Nehwal for elevating India’s global sporting stature.
A special Defence category paid tribute to Operation Sindoor, recognising senior officers representing the Air Force, Army and Navy for their service and leadership.
Beyond the awards, Mahashivratri 2026 unfolded as a vibrant blend of meditation, music and cultural celebration under the theme “Ganga," highlighting the sacred river’s spiritual and ecological significance. Millions participated both in person and online. For the first time, Sadhguru performed the Yogeshwara Linga Maha Abhishekam, with over five million people registering globally for the free offering.
Reflecting on the timeless relevance of yogic sciences, Sadhguru said, “Adiyogi is not of the past. Adiyogi is of the future because what he gave are not belief systems, philosophies, ideologies or teachings, they’re technologies for wellbeing." He added, “Not looking up. Looking in. In is the only way out."
The event was broadcast live in 25 languages, reaching an estimated 150 million viewers worldwide. On the auspicious night, Sadhguru also announced a free Inner Engineering Online offering available until February 18 and revealed that the consecration of Kala Bhairava will take place later this year at the Isha Yoga Center.
As chants of “Shambho" resonated at midnight, Mahashivratri once again stood as a testament to India’s living spiritual traditions—where devotion, culture and national service meet in a shared vision of a Bhavya Bharat.

Odisha aims to increase the State’s contribution to national Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from 3% to 5%, with average annual growth rising from 7% to 9.5% through reforms in investment, execution, and technology adoption, said Governor Hari Babu Kambhampati on Tuesday (February 17, 2026).
Delivering his inaugural address in the budget session of Odisha Legislative Assembly, Mr. Kambhampati presented State’s strong economic fundamentals and planned massive infrastructure proposals that would give push for further momentum to economic growth.
“The State targets raising per capita income from Rs 1.8 lakh to Rs 32 lakh by 2047, improving living standards, reducing multidimensional poverty to 5%, increasing female labour force participation to 70%, raising life expectancy beyond 80 years and eliminating anaemia and malnutrition, in alignment with India’s Vision and global best practices,” he said.
“Under the leadership of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Central government’s recent approvals for mega-projects in Odisha reflect strong confidence in the State’s future and will unlock significant socio-economic benefits. The approval of the ₹8,300 crore for Rameshwar–Paradip Coastal Highway and 6-lane access-controlled Greenfield Capital Region Ring Road (Bhubaneswar Bypass), with an investment of about ₹8,308 crore, would surely improve connectivity,” said Odisha Governor in his address.
“The Odisha State Road Policy, 2025 has been implemented to create a high-quality road network for seamless movement of people and goods, while the Odisha State Highway Authority Act, 2025 has been promulgated to fast-track highway development through a dedicated institutional mechanism,” Mr. Kambhampati pointed out.
Highlighting State’s mineral wealth, he said, “with the efforts of government, Odisha continues to occupy a pre-eminent position in the national mining and steel landscape. The State is endowed with nearly one third of India’s total iron ore reserves and contributed over 61% of the country’s total iron ore production in 2024–25. Odisha also holds the first position in the production of Steel and Stainless Steel in the country.”
“At present, Odisha has 55 operational steel plants with a total installed capacity of around 45.62 Million Tonnes Per Annum (MTPA), accounting for nearly 23% of the country’s total installed steel capacity. With rising per-capita steel consumption, Odisha is positioning itself to contribute 100 million tonnes of steel towards the national target of 300 million tonnes by 2030,” Governor emphasised.
On the anti-Maoist operation front, Mr. Kambhampati said, “The government has achieved significant success on the anti-Left Wing Extremism through sustained and proactive operational and administrative action, leading to a marked improvement in the situation in the State.”
“In the last 5 years, 48 Maoist cadres were neutralised, 78 were arrested and 82 surrendered. Notably, in 2025 alone, 25 Maoist cadres were neutralised, including 17 in joint operations with Chhattisgarh Police, CRPF and CoBRA at the Nuapada-Gariyabandh border, 9 cadres were arrested, and 29 surrendered. Large quantities of arms, ammunition, explosives and other incriminating materials were also recovered,” he informed.

The headman of Viruthampattu village panchayat near Katpadi in Vellore was among 27 persons booked by Vellore North police on Tuesday over the injury of seven persons after a 60-foot temple chariot toppled during the annual Mayana Kollai festival held on the banks of Palar River on Monday.
Police said the village headman K. Sridhar, 52, of Viruthampattu village was one of the organisers of the annual festival held on the  riverbed near the new bus terminus, off the Chennai - Bengaluru Highway (NH 48).
The police said that as per norms, temple chariots should not exceed 12 feet in height. However, during the Mayana Kollai festival in Vellore, chariots from Virudhambattu, Kazhinjur, and Mottur were reportedly around 60 feet tall, resulting in the collapse. “Strict action will be taken against those who violate laws and traffic rules. Cases have been registered against those responsible for the incident,” said N.U. Sivaraman, SP (Vellore).
Police said that based on a complaint from D. Kasi, village administrative officer (VAO), Viruthampattu village, cases were registered against 27 persons under Section 125 (a) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023, that punishes any person who acts rashly or negligently in a way that endangers human life or personal safety of others. The punishment can be imprisonment of up to three months, a fine up to ₹2,500, or both even if no actual harm is caused.
Initial inquiry revealed that the Mayana Kollai festival, one of the prominent annual events in the region, was held on the Palar riverbank on Monday. As part of the celebrations, deities from 10 villages were decorated, placed on temple chariots, and taken in procession to the riverbed where devotees performed traditional rituals and offerings.
Police said that during the procession, one of the chariots tilted sideways. In the impact, seven persons were injured. The incident happened around 11.30 p.m on Monday. The police and devotees rescued the injured and rushed them to Government Medical College Hospital in Vellore.
On being informed, V.R. Subbulaxmi and SP Mr. Sivaraman inspected the spot. Later, Ms. Subbulaxmi also met the injured persons at the hospital before she ordered an inquiry into the incident.

Day One of BioAsia 2026 saw a clutch of firms announcing projects in Telangana, from an animal vaccine manufacturing facility to expansion of an innovation hub focussed on AI driven health and Life Sciences analytics.
Together, the projects announced in the presence of Chief Minister A.Revanth Reddy are expected to generate several thousand jobs. The investments proposed on the facilities were not, however, specified by most of the firms.
French global consumer healthcare company Opella Healthcare, spun off from Sanofi, said it is expanding its Hyderabad GCC operations in a 42,000 sq. ft. facility. The move will create up to 500 jobs within the next year, it said.
Vaksindo Animal Health, a division of Indonesian multinational JAPFA, said it is establishing a BSL-3 vaccine manufacturing facility in Genome Valley. The facility will focus on producing vaccines for poultry, cattle, swine, and aquaculture and generate about 300 jobs.
AI and data science company Tredence Inc said it is expanding its India operations with the launch of a new 20,000 sq. ft. delivery and innovation centre in Nanakramguda, Hyderabad. It will be a dedicated innovation hub focused on AI-driven healthcare and life sciences analytics and support its global operations.
Tredence said more than 400 employees are already working in Telangana and that it plans to grow the workforce to over 2,200 by 2027. The hiring push will see about 700 new roles added in 2026, followed by another 1,100 positions the year after. Chief Technology Officer and co-founder Sumit Mehra said “our expansion announcement represents a strategic investment in the city’s robust data and AI talent landscape and as well as its rapidly evolving retail, CPG and consumer GCC ecosystem.”
Another project, announced at BioAsia, was by Rx Propellant to develop a new, large-format Life Sciences campus in Genome Valley. The project will comprise over 1 million sq ft of advanced laboratory infrastructure across 12 acres of site delivered in phases over next six years. The estimated investment will be ₹1,000 crore and 5,000 jobs are likely to be generated.

Chalavadi Narayanaswamy
Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council Chalavadi Narayanaswamy has accused the Congress government of illegally sanctioning government land at throwaway prices in 31 locations to build Congress Bhavans.
Addressing a press conference in Bengaluru on Tuesday, Mr. Narayanaswamy alleged that five sites from the Revenue Department and 26 from local bodies had been sanctioned for the construction of Congress Bhavans.
Most of these lands were civic amenities (CA) sites that were not supposed to be allocated for the construction of political party offices, he alleged, and said that the State Cabinet had approved the allocation of such sites as the officials concerned had raised objection to their allotment, citing procedural issues.
While the allotment of these lands for political purposes itself was against the norms, the government had indulged in one more irregularity by allotting them at just 5% of their market value, he alleged.
Citing an example, he said a CA site measujring 4,404 square metres worth ₹4.08 crore in Chickballapur had been allocated at a mere ₹20.42 lakh. Similarly 613 square metres of government land worth ₹24.52 lakh in Badami had been sanctioned for just ₹1.22 lakh. In Mandya, land worth ₹1.45 crore had been sanctioned for ₹7.28 lakh, he alleged.
He urged the government authorities to take back the land allotted. Mr. Narayanaswamy said his party would take up a legal fight if the allotment was not withdrawn.
Responding to the BJP leader’s allegation, Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar, also president of the KPCC, said the party was constructing 100 Congress Bhavans as part of the centenary of Mahatma Gandhi’s presidency of the Congress. “Yes, we are using government land for Congress Bhavans. We are allotting 5,000 to 10,000 sq. ft. plots,” he said.
He pointed out that during the BJP’s tenure, land had been allotted to various trusts in Bengaluru at concessional rates. “The land given to Chanakya University is worth ₹10 crore per acre, but it was allotted at ₹50 lakh per acre for 100 acres.”
He further asked, “If land was not allotted by the BJP government, how was the RSS office constructed?”

Highlighting the major allocations and policy directions in the ₹3.32 lakh crore budget for 2026–27 presented recently, members in the Assembly lauded the government for its well-conceived budgetary provisions and forward-looking vision reflected in the comprehensive planning, on Tuesday (February 17, 2026).
Amadalavalasa MLA Koona Ravi Kumar slammed the previous YSRCP government, alleging that it had derailed the governance and became synonymous with exploitation. He said that the TDP-led coalition government, that inherited ₹9,75,000 crore in debt and ₹1,35,000 crore in pending liabilities, gave top priority to SC, ST and BC welfare.
MLA K. Murali Mohan from Puthalapadu in Chittoor district said that the credit for allocation of significant funds to mango farmers goes to Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu. Citing increasing funding to transform Rayalaseema into a horticulture hub, he said multiple schemes were introduced to ensure inclusive development.
Former Minister Prathipati Pullarao said that the State was moving towards long-term growth and development. He said farmers were being encouraged and supported and old-age pensions had been increased to ₹4,000 per month, which cost around ₹27,000 crore annually to the State exchequer.
Adireddy Srinivas from Rajamahendravaram described the budget as the foundation for a State’s future. He said allocation of ₹6,000 crore for Amaravati project reflected the seriousness of the government to develop the new capital with global standards.
MLA Lokam Madhavi from Nellimarla in Vizianagaram district referred to the ‘Palle Panduga’ initiative for laying roads in villages and said allocations across departments were satisfactory.
Member B.V. Jaya Nageswara Reddy from Emmiganur criticised the Opposition members for showing scant regard for the Assembly proceedings. Calling it a ‘People’s Budget”, she said allocation for irrigation projects was thoughtful.
P.G.V.R. Naidu (Ganababu), MLA from Visakhapatnam West, said the State was moving from destruction towards development. He said the rapid development of Hyderabad city in the past reflected the Chief Minister’s vision and emphasised the need to bring companies to the State to generate employment for the youth.
Kandula Narayana Reddy from Markapuram accused the YCP of weakening the agriculture sector, while MLA V.M. Thomas from Gangadhara Nellore suggested establishment of IVF and test tube centres in villages as part of populatin policy, in line with the Chief Minister’s vision.

Artificial intelligence is a powerful enabler that can transform disease surveillance, diagnosis, treatment, and healthcare delivery, and act as an assistive force that strengthens doctors, not replace them, said Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare Anupriya Patel.
Participating as the chief guest in the second convocation ceremony of AIIMS, Mangalagiri, on Tuesday (February 17, 2026), Ms. Anupriya Patel said that when aligned with public purpose, technology can expand access, improve efficiency, and save lives.
She told the students that a convocation does not mark the end of learning, but the beginning of a lifelong journey of continuous growth, discovery, and service to humanity.
Later, Minister for Human Resources and Development N. Lokesh, who participated in the event as the Guest of Honour, recalled the growth of the institute from a modest beginning in 2015 to comprehensive tertiary care institution with nearly 650 functional beds, over 1,300 students, and advanced services including open-heart surgeries, kidney transplants, robotic knee replacements, advanced oncology care, and Cath lab facilities.
Paying tribute to the selfless service of doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic, he said that while technology and AI will continue to advance healthcare, the healing power of human touch, empathy, and humility remain irreplaceable.
Degrees were conferred on 49 MBBS students, five postgraduate students, and four PDCC graduates during the ceremony.  Executive Director and CEO Ahanthem Santa Singh presented the institute’s project report, outlining the progress achieved in academics, patient care, infrastructure expansion, research, and super-specialty services.

Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Tuesday (February 17, 2026) apologised for the difficulties faced by attendees on the opening day of the India AI Impact Summit, even as Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge criticised the Modi Government for the “utter chaos and rank mismanagement”.
Addressing a press conference at Bharat Mandapam, the summit venue, Mr. Vaishnaw said the turnout on Monday (February 16, 2026) was “phenomenal”, and assured participants that corrective steps had been taken to ensure a smoother experience in the coming days.
More than 70,000 people attended the summit on the first day, he said. “This is the biggest AI summit in the entire world. The response is phenomenal. The energy is palpable. We can see the organisation is very smooth now. If anybody faced any problems yesterday, we apologise for that,” Mr. Vaishnaw said. A “war room” had been set up to address grievances and operational issues, he added.
Earlier, in a post on X, Mr. Kharge said that what could have been a global showcase of India’s digital capabilities had turned into “utter chaos” due to mismanagement.
“What could have been a showpiece AI Summit for the entire world demonstrating the digital & AI capabilities of India, has reportedly turned into utter chaos and rank mismanagement by this “PR hungry” government!” Mr. Kharge said on X.
What could have been a showpiece AI Summit for the entire world demonstrating the digital & AI capabilities of India, has reportedly turned into utter chaos and rank mismanagement by this "PR hungry" government!Founders, exhibitors and visitors - all face extreme distress due…
He claimed that founders, exhibitors and visitors faced distress because of security restrictions ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit (for the inauguration), and alleged that basic facilities such as food and water were lacking. He also cited reports of stolen products, failed digital systems, and restrictions on personal electronic devices.
“It is extremely unfortunate that our country has to suffer this global embarrassment due to the incompetence of our own government. Perhaps the Modi Government should learn from the Bengaluru Tech Summit (BTS), which is an annual feature in smoothly organising such large-scale digital & tech congregations,” the Congress chief posted.
The opening day of the summit saw packed halls, long queues and confusion over entry instructions, with mobile data connectivity also proving unreliable at the venue. Heavy footfall led to overlapping security checks and the temporary evacuation of some exhibitor stalls ahead of the Prime Minister’s visit to the expo.
Amid the disruption, some participants reported misplaced or stolen items. Dhananjay Yadav, CEO of NeoSapien, said on X that security personnel asked exhibitors to vacate their stalls ahead of the Prime Minister’s visit and assured them their belongings would be safe. He later claimed that some of the company’s AI wearables were stolen.
“Think about this: We paid for flights, accommodation, logistics and even the booth. Only to see our wearables disappear inside a high-security zone. If only security and official entourage had access, how did this happen? This is extremely disappointing,” Mr. Yadav wrote.
Punit Jain, founder of Reskill, initially criticised the arrangements, saying exhibitors and delegates were left outside without water or clarity on access.
“Exhibitors, delegates, start-up founders were left outside. No water. No clarity. The media shows celebration. Ground reality was chaos. If access was limited to select high-value guests, just say it upfront. Don’t mobilize the ecosystem and then displace them. This is not how we build India’s AI future,” Mr. Jain wrote on X on Monday (February 16, 2026).
However, he acknowledged that coordination improved significantly on Tuesday (February 17, 2026), the second day of the summit.
Entrepreneur Priyanshu Ratnakar also pointed to long queues, exhibitors being locked out of stalls, patchy connectivity and repeated registration glitches, calling the experience “optics over execution”.
Organisers said corrective measures were taken through the day to ease congestion and improve coordination, and assured participants that the remaining days of the summit would run more smoothly. The summit will conclude on February 20.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday (February 17, 2026) virtually inaugurated the Tata Advanced Systems’ Final Assembly Line for the Airbus H125 helicopter.
The facility in Vemagal in Kolar district of Karnataka, is India’s first private-sector helicopter Final Assembly Line for the Airbus H125. This is the first time the Indian private sector will undertake the manufacturing, integration, testing and maintenance of a sophisticated rotary-wing platform in India.
To start off with, the civil H125 will be built at this facility and in future the military variant of the helicopter could also be built.
The first ‘Made in India’ H125 is expected to be delivered early 2027 and will also be available for export across the South Asian region.
Tata Advanced Systems Limited and Airbus said that the H125M is optimised to serve as a high-altitude force multiplier across a spectrum of critical missions.
Defence Minister Rajnath Singh who was present on the occasion said that the H-125 programme investment is anticipated to exceed ₹1,000 crore.
“The H-125 programme is likely to create direct and indirect employment opportunities for our skilled and hard working younger generation,” Mr. Singh said.
Minister of the Armed Forces and Veterans Affairs of France Catherine Vautrin said the inauguration of the facility is a testament to French-Indian defense cooperation.
Karnataka Large and Medium Industries Minister M B Patil said 500 H125 light helicopters will be manufactured over the next 20 years at this facility. Mr. Patil said that 17 acres of land had been allotted for the project.
“After France, the United States and Brazil, Karnataka has now become home to the world’s fourth H125 helicopter manufacturing and Final Assembly Line (FAL) facility, a development that will further strengthen the aerospace ecosystem in the State,” he said.

The Tamil Nadu State Budget will be formulated to integrate climate action across schemes implemented by all departments to ensure climate considerations are embedded in governance at every level, said Chief Minister M.K. Stalin at the Tamil Nadu Climate Summit 4.0 on Tuesday.
Mr. Stalin said Tamil Nadu would formulate State-level determined contributions to cut its carbon emissions by 2030, just as India had committed to nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement to reduce carbon emissions. These would serve as clear targets, with concrete measures undertaken to achieve them, he said.
He also declared that five lakh sandalwood saplings would be distributed for planting across Tamil Nadu to enhance green cover. Additionally, he said industries and government institutions would jointly invest in green technologies to reduce emissions. Mr. Stalin laid the foundation for the International Dugong Conservation Centre in Thanjavur.
At the summit, Mr. Stalin launched the Tamil Nadu Sustainably Harnessing Ocean Resources and Blue Economy (TN-SHORE) scheme. Under this initiative, ₹1.7 crore had been earmarked as revolving funds and micro-credit support for 34 mangrove conservation committees. From this allocation, ₹5 lakh each was distributed to three mangrove forest protection committees from Killai, Cuddalore district.
Further, under the Tamil Nadu Green Climate Fund, financial assistance was extended to Kannabiran Polymers Ltd (₹20 crores), Ooru Cabs (₹25 crores), and Esygo Power (₹75 crore) to promote environmentally sustainable industrial practices.
In the presence of Mr. Stalin, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between IIT Madras, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and the Tamil Nadu Green Climate Company for establishing a Centre for Circular Economy at IIT Madras.
Finance and Environment Minister Thangam Thennarasu, Forests Minister R.S. Rajakannappan, Environment & Forests Secretary Supriya Sahu, Dena Umali-Deininger, Regional Director for South Asia, World Bank and others were present.

AIADMK general secretary Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Tuesday reiterated his charge that the DMK regime had “let down” employees of the State government.
Giving his reaction to the Interim Budget presented in the Assembly earlier in the day, Mr. Palaniswami, in an interaction with reporters, contended that not even one-fourth of the DMK’s electoral promises, made in the run-up to the 2021 Assembly polls, had been fulfilled. Be it with respect to the old pension scheme for the government employees or issues concerning noon meal staff, government nurses and farmers, the government had not done anything to translate into action its assurances. “Like in the last five years, this Budget too is a deceptive address and full of jugglery of words,” Mr. Palaniswami alleged.
He also argued that the burden of loan and taxes had risen. Though Finance and Agriculture Ministers had delivered Budget speeches for a total of five hours, there was “nothing concrete” in them, he added.
In a post on his social media handle, Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) general secretary T.T.V. Dhinakaran criticised the DMK regime for “not taking up productive schemes” and “only increasing the loan.” In a statement, former interim general secretary of the AIADMK V.K. Sasikala wanted to know from the government how many buses had been procured for the public transport system as in the last five years, there had been announcements that 12,087 would be purchased at a cost of ₹6,121 crore.

India and France renewed the defence cooperation agreement for another 10 years on Tuesday (February 17, 2026) at the 6th India-France Annual Defence Dialogue in Bengaluru.
In the meeting, co-chaired by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Minister of the Armed Forces and Veterans Affairs of France Catherine Vautrin, India asked France to increase “indigenous content” in the Rafale by up to 50%, and also expand the Rafale’s maintenance, repair and overhaul facility in India.
The cooperation agreement was signed by India’s Defence Secretary and France’s Deputy Director General for International Relations and Strategy. Besides, both countries announced Reciprocal Deployment Officers at Indian Army and French Land Forces establishments.
The two Ministers discussed a range of bilateral security and defence issues, including priority areas for co-development and co-production of equipment.
The Defence Ministry said the two leaders emphasised on the need for a closer defence partnership, connecting industries of both nations, especially in the field of niche technology. It said the two Ministers reaffirmed the commitment to enhance military-to-military cooperation as a key pillar of the strategic partnership.
Mr. Singh said the recent India-EU Security and Defence Partnership marked a significant step in deepening the collective engagement. “Both Ministers agreed to leverage this framework, both bilaterally and in the wider European context for tangible outcomes that will strengthen regional stability, enhance joint capabilities, and reinforce the enduring Indo-French strategic alignment,” the Ministry said.
An MoU on Joint Venture was also signed for the manufacturing of Hammer missiles in India between the Chairman and Managing Director of Bharat Electronics Limited and Executive Vice President, Safran Electronics and Defence.
Mr. Singh emphasised that India has been the first responder and net security provider for countries in the Indian Ocean Region and always extends assistance to them in the defence, security and maritime domains to augment their capabilities and ward off any adversary.
On terrorism, he said Pakistan has a long history of nurturing cross-border terrorism to create disturbance and violence in India. “This has created a serious threat to peace in the region,” he said.

--------------------
Tamil Nadu Finance Minister Thangam Thennarasu on Tuesday presented the Interim Budget for 2026-27, steering clear of any last-minute populist announcement in the poll-bound State, while highlighting the achievements of the DMK government in the last five years.
In his 142-minute speech, Mr. Thennarasu also outlined the challenges faced by the State from the Centre, including the denial of major infrastructure projects, the withholding of funds, curtailment of tax revenues without consultation, and the unfair imposition of conditions mandating expenditure.
He said that in the last five years, the DMK government had deftly managed several floods and cyclones. It had sought ₹50,922 crore in relief assistance from the Centre, which, however, sanctioned a meagre ₹1,151 crore. The Centre had allocated only ₹6,013 crore to Tamil Nadu under the State Disaster Response Fund in the last five years. However, the State had allocated ₹15,173 crore during this period, incurring an additional expenditure of ₹9,160 crore for disaster management.
He also listed the flagship schemes implemented by the M.K. Stalin government. Among the schemes were Kalaignar Magalir Urimai  Thittam, the Chief Minister’s Breakfast Scheme for school students, Pudhumai Penn, Tamil Pudhalvan, Naan Mudhalvan, Magalir Vidiyal Payanam, and Makkalai Thedi Maruthuvam.
According to the Interim Budget estimates, the State’s outstanding debt is put at ₹10.71 lakh crore, compared with ₹9.52 lakh crore in the Revised Estimates for 2025-26. Total revenue receipts are expected to stand at ₹3.44 lakh crore, an increase of 11.26% over the Revised Estimates for 2025-26, while total revenue expenditure is projected to rise to ₹3.93 lakh crore, 3.79% higher than the Revised Estimates for 2025-26.

After a relatively chaotic first day on Monday (February 16, 2026), the AI Impact Summit saw smoother operations on Tuesday (February 17, 2026), with more areas opened to attendees and fewer surges of crowding, even as turnout remained strong. Students bused in from local colleges, schools, and corporates queued up outside multiple gates, but the lines moved steadily.
All sections of the government’s flagship AI event—promoted for months—were opened to the public, helping ease congestion. Unlike on the opening day, there were no security-led evacuations of large areas. In fact, additional hall space at the 100-acre Bharat Mandapam complex was formally opened, allowing visitors to spread out evenly.
The three-day gap before the gathering of heads of State allowed organisers to address the initial glitches. At food courts, freshly printed banners now announced the acceptance of digital payments. On Monday (February 16), attendees had complained that some cash counters were refusing UPI and card payments.
“Less crowd today (February 17, 2026), smoother movement, and big banners outside meeting rooms for better visibility,” Vijay S., an attendee, posted on X, calling it a “good recovery after yesterday’s chaos.” Visitors had also flagged inadequate clear signage on the opening day.
However, technical issues persisted. Many sessions continued to experience problems with livestreams, with the IndiaAI YouTube channel’s broadcasts constantly starting late, skipping speaker introductions, and audio going silent on several sessions.
Public transport
Logistical challenges continued outside the main venue. While most events were held within the sprawling complex—which already requires several minutes of walking to attend sessions tightly packed into each day’s schedules—some programmes were conducted at Sushma Swaraj Bhawan, with side events organised by third-party organisations across central Delhi.
The two nearest metro stations are a several-minute walk from the venue, making it difficult for attendees to quickly travel to different sessions. Two speakers were unable to make it to their sessions owing to traffic and long, albeit moving, queues at entry gates. While it is common for conventions spread across such a large area to have fixed-schedule shuttle services that ply regardless of occupancy, the organisers opted for only demand-based runs, leaving many attendees with limited transport options.

--------------------
In surprise inspections conducted State-wide, under the code name Operation Skill Guard, the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau has detected widespread corruption as well as serious irregularities in the implementation of the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY) scheme in the State.
Preliminary investigations pointed to rampant corruption and irregularities indulged in by the project implementing agencies, in collusion with officials.
The surprise inspections were carried out on Monday from 10.30 a.m. onwards at 62 locations, including 47 selected project-implementing agencies, the State Project Office responsible for DDU-GKY, and 14 district implementation offices.
The Vigilance had received information that there were serious lapses and fraud in the execution of the scheme, including fake claims about trainee admissions even though they were not imparted any training, and producing fake salary certificates and forged bank statements to falsely show that the trainees had secured employment.
The Vigilance also had information on the misappropriation of project funds by implementing agencies, in collusion with district-level and State-level officials who were responsible for verification and monitoring.
Projects were being approved without even verifying availability of basic infrastructure at training centres. Some implementing agencies were forging records to claim money for training people. Some trainees had not participated in any training.
The clause that implementing agencies should mandatorily have three years’ experience was being observed more in the breach.
The Vigilance also found that funds were collected fully without ensuring that the trainees had found placements. Project funds were utilised to pay salaries to staff who did not have any connection with the project.
Verification through telephonic contact with trainees revealed that many had not received their post-placement allowances whereas in some cases, agencies had used forged records to claim post placement allowance.
Several agencies had also failed to renew mandatory bank guarantees required for project execution. Despite this, funds were released even to agencies that had not properly recorded placement details in the online portal.
In some cases, agencies collected one or two instalments of project funds and abandoned training midway.
The Vigilance has also given out the details of specific irregularities it found in districts.
It has recommended detailed investigation into the irregularities and corruption in the implementation of the scheme and said that follow-up inspections will be conducted in the coming days.
The Director of Vigilance, Manoj Abraham, said in a statement that a detailed scrutiny of bank account statements of the implementing agencies, staff, trainees, and concerned officials was in order and that all project-related files would be re-examined. He also requested the public to share any information they may have on corruption related to the scheme through the Vigilance’s toll-free number 1064 or the phone number: 85929 00900 or on WhatsApp number 9447789100.

Members of civil society group Campaign for Rohith Act have urged the State government to enact the Karnataka’s Rohith Vemula (Protection of SC/STs from Caste Discrimination in Higher Educational Institutions) Bill 2025, which aims to safeguard the right to education and dignity of the Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST) students in universities and higher educational institutions, in the upcoming Budget session.
They also urged the government to release the draft Rohith Vemula Act for public consultation and announce a clear timeline for its introduction and passage in the Legislative Assembly.
Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, Mavalli Shankar, State Convenor, Dalit Sangharsh Samiti said,
“On January 17, 2026, Rahul Gandhi, Leader of the Opposition of Lok Sabha, publicly stated that the Karnataka government was in the process of implementing the Rohith Vemula Act. However, no draft has yet been released for public consultation, nor has a clear legislative timeline been announced. This delay has caused growing anxiety among SC/ST students across the State.”
“The Campaign reiterates that existing regulatory measures, including the UGC Equity Regulations, 2026, are insufficient to address structural caste-based discrimination in higher education. A dedicated Rohith Vemula Act remains urgently necessary. The enactment of the Rohith Vemula Act would mark a historic step toward ensuring dignity, equality, and justice in Karnataka’s universities and colleges,” he added.

The Minister said 10 select institutions from Malappuram, Palakkad, Thrissur, and Alappuzha districts were being announced as model institutions in the first phase. Forty-one institutions have been selected as part of the second phase. A project was being prepared for each of them in association with the National Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Thrissur.
The government had given approval for spending ₹4.7 crore on infrastructure development and providing equipment for children in 29 select BUDS institutions functioning under the Kudumbashree, Mr. Rajesh said.
He also announced that a health/life insurance scheme would be launched for BUDS staff, including teachers and ayahs, from this year.
The Minister said ₹2 lakh each had been sanctioned for all BUDS institutions launched in the first phase for infrastructure development, while ₹25 lakh would be given to newly opened ones. An amount of ₹15 lakh each had also been sanctioned to 30 BUDS schools for purchasing vehicles.
As many as 187 BUDS schools and 218 BUDS rehabilitation centres function in the State.
According to the revised guidelines, a unified training model would be implemented under the umbrella of the Kudumbashree for teachers and ayahs in these institutions.

Member of the Legislative Council Shashil G. Namoshi on Tuesday launched a scathing attack on the Congress-led State government saying that its claims of “1,000 days of achievement” ring hollow in the face of 2.84 lakh vacant posts across 43 departments in the State.
Addressing a press conference in Kalaburagi on Tuesday, Mr. Namoshi accused the State government of failing to address mounting vacancies and delaying recruitment on the pretext of internal reservation.
He said that 2,84,881 posts are lying vacant in 43 departments. Of these, 1.02 lakh posts are vacant in various Boards and Corporations, while around 40,000 posts remain unfilled in the seven districts of the Kalyana Karnataka region.
Providing a department-wise break-up, he said that 93,293 posts are vacant in the Education sector, including 79,694 in Primary and Secondary Education and 13,599 in Higher Education.
As many as 37,572 posts are vacant in the Health and Family Welfare and Medical Education Departments, 28,188 in the Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms, 10,867 posts in the Revenue Department and 10,504 posts in the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department.
Mr. Namoshi said that the State government is delaying appointments due to a lack of funds and its inability to bear the salary burden. In the last two-and-a-half years of governance under Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, he said, only 11,238 posts have been notified and 8,157 candidates recruited.
He, however, said that even these 8,157 appointments are now embroiled in litigation due to issues related to internal reservation with cases pending before courts.
He clarified that the BJP is not opposed to internal reservation but it has advised the State government to proceed with recruitment as per the earlier roster system until legal hurdles are resolved, instead of citing internal reservation as a reason for delay.
He contended that the State government has made an attempt to mask financial constraints by postponing recruitment and is now embarrassed after the High Court directed it to proceed with the appointment process by implementing the earlier 50% reservation roster system.
He demanded that the State government draw up a time-bound action plan to fill all vacant posts as per the earlier roster system and particularly, expedite recruitment to posts in the Kalyana Karnataka region in accordance with Article 371(J) without citing the need for Finance Department approval.
He urged the State government to prioritise immediate appointments to improve the quality of public services and provide employment opportunities to youth, instead of attributing delays to internal reservation issues.

Addressing a joint press conference on the sidelines of the CPI State-level party meeting, Mr. Ramakrishna demanded that the government develop all necessary infrastructure in the newly sanctioned medical colleges on its own, without handing over responsibilities to private partners.

--------------------
Tamil Nadu has not implemented any scheme for increasing job generation in the State, alleged K. Annamalai, former State president of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Coimbatore on February 17, 2026, (Tuesday).
He told the media that according to the Interim Budget of the State, which was presented on Tuesday, the debt GDP ratio of the State has not reduced. Instead, the debt of the State in 2025-2026 is ₹9.29 lakh crore and it is projected to increase to ₹10.62 lakh crore next fiscal.
Tamil Nadu government will borrow ₹1.33 lakh crore in one year. According to the revenue receipt projection of the Budget last year, the State was expected to generate ₹3.31 lakh crore revenue. But, the actual realisation is ₹3.09 lakh crore. So there is ₹21,871 crore shortfall. “This is a government that does not generate revenue and spends by borrowing,” he said.
The gross enrolment ratio in higher education was 49 % when the DMK came to power four years ago. It has reduced by two percentage points to 47 % this year. The allocation for Higher Education Department is increased by just ₹11 crore. But, the government has announced that it will renovate Anna University at ₹1,380 crore. The allocation for the VB-G RAM G (rural employment scheme) has been reduced and just 23,879 people have submitted applications for the ‘Kalaignar Kaivinai Thittam’. The Central government implements the Vishwakarma scheme and though it is not implemented in Tamil Nadu, nearly eight lakh people had registered for it from the State.
The DMK government has said it spent ₹8,100 crore for temple renovation. But, it spent just about ₹82 crore. It should release a white paper on the amount spent for temples. The agriculture sector grew just 3 % in the State, while it grew at CAGR 10 % in Gujarat when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat for 10 years, he claimed.
The PLI scheme of the Central government is instrumental for development of electronic clusters in the State. The DMK government has not implemented any scheme to generate jobs in Tamil Nadu, he said.

“All members of the Congress, including Ministers, legislators, leaders and workers, will accept the decision of the party high command on leadership change,” Minister and Congress leader Laxmi Hebbalkar said in Belagavi on Tuesday.
“We are all committed to adhering to the high command’s decision on the issue. However, we have been asked not to talk about it. It will not only be wrong to talk about it but also an unforgivable crime to do so,” she told reporters.
She was speaking at the launch of Akka Pade, an all-women police team aimed at protecting women and girls.
Ms. Hebbalkar said that she has asked officers to find a permanent solution to the problems of water scarcity in some of the areas in Belagavi, the district that has higher rain days than other districts.
“We will implement them in such a way that the people do not suffer any inconvenience this summer,” she said.
She said that she is requesting the State government to create a Belagavi rural taluk. She added that she is working towards building a bus stand in Hire Bagevadi village, which has now been upgraded from a gram panchayat to a town panchayat.

--------------------
The Forum for Good Governance has urged the Telangana government to expedite action in the long-pending 2010 liquor scam cases, alleging prolonged delays and lack of clarity on proceedings against several officials.
In a representation to Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy, Forum president M. Padmanabha Reddy stated that though a Special Investigation Team (SIT) was initially constituted in undivided Andhra Pradesh to probe the scam, it was abruptly wound up and the inquiry was later entrusted to the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB).
As per submissions made earlier before the High Court, 48 cases were registered involving 1,118 officials and 174 private individuals, with prosecution orders reportedly issued against 929 officials in 2012. However, the Forum alleged that after State bifurcation, there has been little visible progress.
Citing information obtained through RTI response on February 5, the Forum claimed that while prosecution permission was granted in 316 cases relating to the Prohibition and Excise Department, 211 were referred to tribunals for disciplinary proceedings, 75 were sent to Commissioner of Inquiries and 20 were sent for department inquiries and none have reached final disposal. It also sought clarity on action taken against 132 police officials who were reportedly ordered to be prosecuted.
“During last 16 years, some tainted officials got promotion and some retired.  In case of Home department, 132 police officials were ordered to be prosecuted. The delay in disposal of liquor scam cases is sending wrong signal to corrupt officials, especially in Prohibition and Excise department and in Police department,” the letter read.

The Andhra Pradesh government has sanctioned ₹150.09 crore for replacing the gates of the Dowleswaram Barrage on the Godavari, Water Resources Minister Nimmala Ramanaidu informed the Legislative Assembly on Tuesday.
Replying to a question by Anaparthi MLA Nallamilli Ramakrishna Reddy during the Question Hour, the Minister described the Dowleswaram Barrage as the ‘lifeline’ of the Godavari delta system, irrigating about 10.13 lakh acres in the undivided twin Godavari districts and meeting drinking water and industrial needs.
Mr. Ramanaidu recalled that in 2014, the Telugu Desam Party government had replaced 58 of the 175 gates of the Dowleswaram Barrage at a cost of ₹31.77 crore. After assuming office in 2024, the coalition government sanctioned funds to replace the remaining 117 gates.
Mr. Ramanaidu alleged that warnings from the Central Water Commission (CWC) during the previous YSR Congress Party’s (YSRCP) tenure were not adequately addressed.
He credited Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu for prioritising the barrage’s safety and modernisation. The works will be executed in phases, using stop-log gates to ensure an uninterrupted irrigation water supply.
Additionally, ₹13.4 crore has been allocated for preparing a Detailed Project Report (DPR) and conducting an aerial LiDAR survey to address flood management and structural concerns in the Godavari Delta.
The Minister also responded to queries by Kandukur MLA Inturi Nageswara Rao on the Rallapadu Reservoir in Prakasam district. He informed the House that the reservoir, with a storage capacity of 1.10 tmc ft, irrigates nearly 16,000 acres and supplies drinking water to 116 villages. Of this, 14,500 acres are served through the right canal and 1,500 acres through the left main canal.
He stated that ₹36.50 crore had earlier been sanctioned for the expansion of the left main canal, but the works were cancelled later. In December 2024, technical issues prevented the lifting of stop-log gates, affecting water release despite the reservoir being full. Motors were subsequently installed to restore supply.
The government has undertaken repairs and canal works at a cost of ₹2.54 crore and is taking up 190 minor irrigation works in Kandukur constituency at an estimated cost of ₹10.86 crore to strengthen irrigation infrastructure, he added.

--------------------
Prime Minister Narendra Modi shared and welcomed Serbia President Aleksandar Vucic’s praise for India’s artificial intelligence progress and its growing global influence, posting his remarks on social media platform X (formerly Twitter).
“A fine article by President Aleksandar Vucic of the Republic of Serbia, in which he talks about AI, of course, but at the same time highlights his fondness for India, India’s strides in AI and strong India-Serbia relations!" PM Modi wrote while sharing the Serbian leader’s opinion piece.
In his article published in The Indian Express, Vucic praised India’s technological ambitions and described the country as being at the centre of global conversations on artificial intelligence.
He said India’s approach to AI focuses on “real-world deployment, ethical standards and inclusive innovation" with applications spanning healthcare, agriculture, education and financial inclusion. He noted that this pragmatic model reflects India’s aspiration to become a trailblazer in using technology for societal good.
Vucic also said the India AI Impact Summit places the country “firmly at the centre of the global discourse on artificial intelligence," and credited PM Modi’s vision to democratise access to technology so that its benefits reach everyone, not just a privileged few.
Reflecting on India’s broader trajectory, the Serbian President said India possesses qualities such as “grit, equanimity and self-belief" in abundance and declared that those who underestimate India’s potential would be proven wrong.
“India is not arriving at the future. It is helping to define it," he wrote.
World And Tech Leaders Praise India’s AI Growth
Global leaders and technology executives also voiced strong support for India’s growing leadership in artificial intelligence. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres praised India as the ideal host for the AI Impact Summit, calling the country “a very successful emerging economy" with an increasingly important role in global affairs.
“I see India in the centre of those emerging economies," Guterres said, adding that he has “a lot of hope for the role that India can play in shaping this multipolar world." He also congratulated India for organising the summit and emphasised the importance of ensuring AI benefits all countries, particularly in the Global South.
Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, described the current moment as an “extraordinary time of hyper progress" and reaffirmed the company’s commitment to partnering with India across the entire AI ecosystem.
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also backed India’s ambitions, saying the country could emerge as a “full-stack AI leader" capable of building core AI systems, infrastructure and applications.

Emmanuel Macron India AI Summit 2026 LIVE Updates: French President Emmanuel Macron will attend the AI Impact Summit hosted by India in Delhi on Wednesday.
Macron and France’s First Lady Brigitte Macron arrived in Mumbai on Tuesday for an official three-day visit to India from 17 to 19 February 2026. This is his fourth official visit to India.
At a joint press meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Macron thanked him for the welcome and spoke about attending the AI summit.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Macron inaugurated the India-France Year of Innovation 2026 at the Gateway of India.
Speaking at the India-France Innovation Forum, Macron said the question is no longer whether India innovates, but who will innovate with India. He said France wants to be that partner and added, “We are here. We want to be here with you. And we are not leaving.”
He also announced an Innovation Day to be held before the G7, led by Franco-Indian initiatives and bringing together students and researchers. Macron said France wants to be a trusted partner so that both countries’ industries can deliver unique cooperation.
The India AI Impact Summit 2026 is being held from 16 to 20 February at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi. It is the first major global AI event hosted in the Global South.
The summit, organised under the IndiaAI Mission, focuses on People, Planet and Progress. It features 12 indigenous foundation models in 22 Indian languages and pavilions from France, Japan, the UK and others.
France has the largest international pavilion, covering 436 square metres, with 29 companies showcasing AI across several sectors.
PM Modi praised Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić for his insightful article on AI and his admiration for India.
Sharing it on X, the Prime Minister highlighted Vučić’s recognition of India’s progress in artificial intelligence and the deep, growing partnership between India and Serbia.

--------------------
After Australia, India is now considering age-based restrictions with social media companies, Information Technology Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Tuesday.
“This is something which has now been accepted by many countries, that age-based [restrictions] … has to be there," Vaishnaw said during a press conference at the AI Impact Summit in the national capital.
“Right now we are in conversation regarding deepfakes, regarding age-based restrictions, with the various social media platforms," Vaishnaw said, adding that the government is discussing “the right way" to enforce the regulation.
However, the minister did not name any specific platforms or companies that are in conversation with the central government.
Any restrictions in India — a country with around 1.4 billion population — could have a major impact on social media firms including Meta and Google, which enjoy an enormous user base in the country.
AUSTRALIA BANS SOCIAL MEDIA FOR UNDER-16s
The move comes as several governments are considering age-based restrictions with social media platforms, given the rising cases of deepfakes, digital arrests, and online blackmailing.
Recently, in December, the Australian government banned users under 16 from accessing major social media platforms. Australia emerged as the first nation in the world to enact such a rule.
Denmark last year approved a new rule to bar users under 15 from social media. In addition, Spain this month announced it would ban under-16s from social media.
Meta’s Facebook and Instagram are two of the most popular social media platforms in India, while Google’s YouTube also boasts a huge audience.

--------------------
French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the 52nd G7 Summit, which will be presided over by France in 2026.
Macron, who is currently on a three-day visit to India, called for an ad hoc meeting between India and France to reach an agreement on the international agenda ahead of the G7 Summit in Evian.
“This year, 2026, is a year of acceleration for our partnership, of translating much of this agenda into action. It is also the year in which the Prime Minister, you, will chair the BRICS group, and France will chair the G7 group. In this spirit, I have invited Prime Minister Modi as a very special guest to the G7 Summit in Evian," the French President said.
“It is also to this end that we have together decided to have, as part of a bilateral segment that the Prime Minister will hold, a moment for innovation, our youth, bringing together Indian youth from the best universities and research centres, our youth in France, Europe, and the G7, so that we can continue to mobilise in the service of innovation and the resolution of the major problems we face," he added.
Macron further called for an effective partnership between New Delhi and Paris over research, student exchanges, and trade.
The Group of Seven (G7) is an intergovernmental political and economic forum consisting of United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, Canada, and the European Union (EU).
Last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended the summit on Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s invitation.
Meanwhile, BRICS is an international group of eleven countries comprising India, Brazil, China, Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and the UAE.
According to the joint statement released by India and France, Prime Minister Modi has welcomed the invitation, noting India’s longstanding partnership with the G7 and its commitment.
Both leaders further expressed confidence that India’s participation would further strengthen collective efforts to address global challenges and promote a more balanced, inclusive, and resilient international order.

--------------------
Galgotias University on Tuesday issued a clarification after facing criticism over the display of a robotic dog at the ongoing AI summit in the national capital, saying it “never claimed to have built the device" and that it was procured from a Chinese manufacturer for academic purposes.
In a statement, the university said the robotic dog was acquired from Unitree, a global robotics company based in China, and is being used as a learning tool for students.
“Let us be clear, Galgotias has not built this robodog, nor have we claimed to do so. What we are building are minds that will soon design, engineer and manufacture such technologies in Bharat," the university said.
The clarification followed a social media backlash after reports claimed that the university showcased the Unitree Go2 robotic dog, an AI-powered device available on Chinese platforms for Rs 2–3 lakh, under the name “Orion" at the AI summit in New Delhi.
Several users accused the institution of presenting imported technology as indigenously developed.
Responding to the controversy, the university said its focus has always been on exposing students to cutting-edge global technologies to prepare them for future innovation.
“From the US to China and Singapore, we bring advanced technologies to campus because exposure creates vision, and vision creates creators," the statement said, adding that the robodog is actively being used by students to test capabilities and explore real-world applications.
Emphasising its academic intent, Galgotias University said innovation should not be limited by borders and learning must remain global in outlook.
“This is not about importing technology, but about inspiring transformation. Our students study, challenge and improve upon global innovations so they can eventually build world-class solutions from India for the world," it added.
The university said it would continue to source advanced technologies internationally to support hands-on learning and foster an ecosystem that empowers young innovators to develop indigenous solutions in the long run.

--------------------
Delhi Police has registered a First Information Report (FIR) in connection with the alleged theft of AI wearable devices during the ongoing India AI Impact Summit at Bharat Mandapam in the national capital.
The action came after a Bengaluru-based startup founder claimed that his company’s AI wearable product went missing from a exhibition stall during a security evacuation ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit on the opening day of the summit.
Dhananjay Yadav, co-founder and CEO of NeoSapien, claimed that the company’s AI wearable went missing from its booth at the summit venue after exhibitors were asked to vacate the area ahead of PM Modi’s visit.
In a post on X, Yadav described the incident as “shocking" and said Day 1 of the summit “turned out to be a pain" for the company. According to him, security personnel began clearing the exhibition area around noon to sanitise the venue ahead of the Prime Minister’s scheduled visit.
Yadav said that he tried to explain that NeoSapien had developed what he described as India’s first patented AI wearable, capable of tracking conversations and analysing emotions, and requested permission to stay back briefly to showcase it.
“Day 1 of the AI Impact Summit turned to be a pain for us. At 12 noon, security personnel arrived to sanitise and cordon off the area ahead of the visit by PM Modi visit at 2pm. I explained that we’re building India’s first patented AI wearable at NeoSapien and requested a chance to showcase it," he said in a post on X.
While one officer initially allowed him to remain, he alleged that another security team later instructed all exhibitors to vacate the area immediately.
He said that he specifically asked whether he should carry the wearable devices along, but was told that even laptops were being left behind and that security would ensure the safety of items kept inside the booths.
“Trusting them, I left," Yadav wrote, adding that the exhibition zone remained sealed for nearly six hours. When access was restored, he claimed the AI wearables were missing. He later shared images on social media showing empty boxes at the NeoSapien stall.
He questioned that how the theft could have taken place when, according to him, only security personnel were allowed inside the exhibition zone at the time.
“If only security and official entourage had access, how did this happen? This is extremely disappointing," he added.
Meanwhile, Union Electronics and IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Tuesday issued a formal apology for logistical challenges and overcrowding that marked the opening day of the summit. Addressing a press conference at Bharat Mandapam, he attributed the disruptions to an “unprecedented" surge in attendance, with more than 70,000 people arriving at the venue on the first day alone.
Vaishnaw said registrations for the five-day event have crossed 300,000 and acknowledged that “pockets of confusion" emerged due to the scale of participation and security arrangements for the Prime Minister’s inauguration. He said a dedicated war room has since been set up to streamline operations and prevent further inconvenience to exhibitors and delegates.
The India AI Impact Summit, being held at Bharat Mandapam, is among the most high-profile technology events hosted in the country this year. The five-day summit, inaugurated on 16 February, has drawn global attention with attendees including Sundar Pichai and Sam Altman.

--------------------
The Telangana government permitted Muslim employees working in government offices to leave work an hour early during the month of Ramzan to offer prayers.
Chief Secretary K Ramakrishna Rao issued an official memorandum allowing Muslim government employees, including teachers, contract and outsourcing staff, employees of boards and corporations, and those working in public sector undertakings, to leave their offices or schools at 4 pm during the fasting period.
The relaxation will be in effect from February 19 to March 20, except in cases where employees are required to remain on duty due to service exigencies.
In a related move, the state’s Director of School Education has approved revised school timings for Ramzan.
From February 19 to March 20, all Urdu-medium government and aided schools, Urdu-medium sections in parallel-medium schools, and DIET colleges will function from 8 am to 1.30 pm.
To compensate for the reduced instructional hours, upper primary and secondary schools will be required to operate for one additional working day, while primary schools will extend their daily schedule by 30 minutes on two working days.
Regional and district education officers have been directed to ensure strict implementation of the revised timings and compensatory arrangements, in line with established practices.
Meanwhile, the Andhra Pradesh government has also issued similar orders allowing Muslim employees in government offices and educational institutions to leave work an hour early during Ramzan.
Minister for Minority Welfare NMD Farooq said the concession in Andhra Pradesh will be applicable from February 18 to March 19.
Officials said the measure is intended to facilitate the observance of religious practices during the fasting month, and departments have been instructed to ensure uniform implementation, barring emergency situations.

--------------------
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said that technology exists to serve humanity, not replace it.
In an exclusive interview with news agency ANI, the Prime Minister explained the vision behind India’s AI Impact Summit 2026 and its motto, “Sarvajan Hitay, Sarvajan Sukhaye," saying that the guiding spirit of the summit reflects India’s civilisational philosophy.
“The guiding spirit, “Sarvajan Hitay, Sarvajan Sukhaye“, reflects India’s civilisational philosophy. The end goal of technology should be ‘Welfare for All, Happiness of All’. Technology exists to serve humanity, not replace it," he said.
PM Modi further said that artificial intelligence stands at a “civilisational inflection point," capable of expanding human capability in unprecedented ways but also posing challenges if left unguided. “That is why we have deliberately framed this Summit around Impact that ensures meaningful and equitable outcomes, not just innovation," he said.
The Prime Minister emphasised that while AI may enhance human capabilities, the ultimate responsibility for decision-making must always remain with human beings.
His remarks came amid the ongoing AI Impact Summit 2026 in the national capital- the first time a global artificial intelligence gathering of this scale is being hosted in the Global South.
The Prime Minister said that the summit is structured around three pillars — People, Planet and Progress — and emphasised that AI systems draw upon knowledge and data generated across societies worldwide.
“AI systems draw upon knowledge and data generated across societies worldwide. Therefore, we want AI’s benefits to be diffused to everyone and not just hoarded by early adopters," he said.
He further said that as the first global AI summit hosted in the Global South, India is creating a platform that amplifies under-represented voices and development priorities.
Highlighting India’s priorities, PM Modi said AI governance, inclusive datasets, climate applications, agricultural productivity, public health and multilingual access are central to the country’s approach.
“Our vision is clear: AI must accelerate global development while remaining deeply human-centric," he said.
India is hosting the AI Impact Summit 2026 at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi from February 16-20, bringing together global policymakers, technology leaders and AI innovators. The event marks the first major global AI summit to be held in the Global South. Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the India AI Impact Expo on Monday.
The summit, which features over 300 pavilions and delegates from 60 countries, continues to host high-profile discussions on responsible AI, sovereign models like BharatGen, and the inevitable role of AI in national defence.
The summit, positioned as one of the world’s largest gatherings dedicated to artificial intelligence, initially struggled to cope with the sheer scale of global interest. With total registrations already surpassing 300,000, the first day saw long queues and significant delays at entry points. Participants, including startup founders, international delegates, and researchers, reported being stranded for hours as security protocols for VVIP movements—including the inauguration by Prime Minister Narendra Modi—clashed with the massive public footfall.

--------------------
The Delhi High Court on Tuesday ordered late industrialist Sunjay Kapur’s wife, Priya Kapur, and sister Mandhira Kapur Smith to refrain from making public statements against each other amid an escalating defamation dispute.
While hearing a civil suit filed by Priya Kapur, who has accused her sister-in-law of running a continuous and defamatory campaign against her through podcasts, interviews, social media posts and other public statements, Justice Mini Pushkarna emphasised the need for dignity and decorum given the nature of the dispute, and said, “Both parties are directed to exercise restraint in making statements on each other, directly or indirectly," news agency PTI reported.
The high court also issued summons to Mandhira Kapur Smith and podcast host Pooja Chaudhri in the matter and listed the case for further hearing in May.
In her lawsuit, Priya Kapur alleged that within days of Sunjay Kapur’s death, his sister “embarked upon a systematic and organised course of conduct" to malign and socially discredit her.
According to the suit, the alleged defamatory statements falsely accused her of dishonesty, moral impropriety, professional incompetence, concealment of assets and illegitimate assumption of corporate control. The plea further claimed that such content was deliberately published and amplified through the podcast ‘InControversial with Pooja Chaudhri’, causing serious harm to her reputation, dignity, privacy and mental peace.
Senior counsel appearing for Priya Kapur argued that Mandhira had uploaded and circulated content on social media with the intent to tarnish her reputation. The suit sought a permanent injunction restraining the defendants from publishing any further content against her, removal of existing material, an unconditional public apology and damages of Rs 20 crore.
On the other hand, counsel for Mandhira Kapur Smith told the court that there was a “concerted media vilification campaign" against her as well.
Sunjay Kapur passed away on June 12 last year after collapsing during a polo match in England. He reportedly suffered a sudden cardiac arrest.
Priya Kapur has also filed a criminal defamation case against Mandhira Smith before a trial court.

TITLE: AI Summit Snarl: Ashwini Vaishnaw Apologises, Says Massive Youth Turnout Behind Day-One Disruptions
LINK: https://www.news18.com/tech/ai-summit-snarl-vaishnaw-apologises-says-massive-youth-turnout-behind-day-one-disruptions-9910194.html
--------------------
Union Electronics and IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw issued a formal apology on Tuesday for the logistical hurdles and overcrowding that marred the opening day of the India AI Impact Summit. Speaking at a press conference at New Delhi’s Bharat Mandapam, the minister attributed the disruptions to a “phenomenal" and unprecedented surge in attendance, which saw more than 70,000 people arrive at the venue on the first day alone.
The summit, positioned as one of the world’s largest gatherings dedicated to artificial intelligence, initially struggled to cope with the sheer scale of global interest. With total registrations already surpassing 300,000, the first day saw long queues and significant delays at entry points. Participants, including startup founders, international delegates, and researchers, reported being stranded for hours as security protocols for VVIP movements—including the inauguration by Prime Minister Narendra Modi—clashed with the massive public footfall.
“The response was phenomenal. The energy is palpable," Vaishnaw remarked, acknowledging the enthusiasm of the youth and the tech community. He admitted that the intensity of the crowd had caused “pockets of confusion", but assured stakeholders that a dedicated war room has been operational since Monday to streamline the experience for the remainder of the five-day event.
The first day was not without specific controversies. Several exhibitors and startup founders voiced their disappointment on social media over overlapping security directives. Most notably, Dhananjay Yadav, CEO of Neo Sapien, alleged that AI wearables intended for display were stolen from his stall during a mandatory security evacuation for the Prime Minister’s visit. Other attendees flagged “patchy" Wi-Fi connectivity and registration glitches that prevented even pre-registered delegates from accessing certain sessions.
Responding to these criticisms, Vaishnaw emphasised that the government is “open-minded" and actively seeking feedback to ensure the organisation remains smooth. He noted that seating capacities and help desks have been increased, and communication regarding security sweeps has been improved to prevent a repeat of the opening-day chaos.
Beyond the apologies, the minister utilised the platform to outline India’s ambitious AI roadmap. He projected that the country is poised to receive over $200 billion in investments across the “AI stack" over the next two years. He highlighted India’s unique position in the Global South, leveraging its Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) to democratise AI access.
The summit, which features over 300 pavilions and delegates from 60 countries, continues to host high-profile discussions on responsible AI, sovereign models like BharatGen, and the inevitable role of AI in national defence. Despite the initial friction, the minister maintained that the event’s scale proves India has arrived as a central pillar of the global AI map.

Gurjeet Singh Aujla, the Congress MP from Amritsar, has written to Union Civil Aviation Minister Kinjarapu Rammohan Naidu raising concerns over the condition of Air India’s long-haul aircraft operating to destinations such as Vancouver, Toronto and Australia.
In his communication, Aujla said passengers on ultra-long-haul routes are paying high fares but travelling on aircraft with non-functional seat-back screens, broken or loose seats, damaged armrests, worn upholstery and poor cabin maintenance. He termed the situation “unacceptable" and urged the minister to ensure immediate upgradation of the long-haul fleet, improved ground support and modern facilities for international passengers, particularly from Punjab. “Our diaspora deserves world-class service," he said.

— Gurjeet Singh Aujla (@GurjeetSAujla) February 16, 2026
The MP stated that he has been receiving growing complaints, especially from travellers belonging to Punjab and the North Indian diaspora, regarding the condition and passenger facilities on these flights. He noted that many travellers have reported malfunctioning in-flight entertainment systems and overall unsatisfactory onboard conditions on journeys often exceeding 12 to 15 hours.
While acknowledging that Air India has initiated a fleet retrofit and modernisation programme to upgrade interiors, seating and entertainment systems, Aujla pointed out that the completion timeline for wide-body aircraft stretches into 2027-28. He said that until the upgrades are fully implemented, passengers — including students, families and working professionals — continue to face avoidable discomfort despite paying premium fares, and called for interim measures to ensure acceptable standards of comfort and service.

TITLE: All About Bharat Mandapan, The Venue Hosting AI Impact Summit In Delhi
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/all-about-bharat-mandapan-the-venue-hosting-ai-impact-summit-in-delhi-ws-l-9909259.html
--------------------
Bharat Mandapam, India’s state-of-the-art International Exhibition and Convention Centre (IECC) at Pragati Maidan in New Delhi, is hosting the ongoing India AI Impact Summit 2026. The venue that now stages global gatherings once stood on what many saw as wasteland. Today, it can seat more people than the Sydney Opera House. Here is what you may not know.
1. Built on historic ground
Bharat Mandapam stands on the 123-acre Pragati Maidan site in central New Delhi. The land hosted an international agriculture fair in 1959, attended by US President Dwight Eisenhower and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev during the Cold War.
It was also home to the Hall of Nations, considered the world’s first large-span cast-in-situ concrete space frame. The structure was demolished overnight in April 2017 despite protests and court cases.
2. A name with meaning
“Bharat" means India. “Mandapam" refers to a pillared pavilion in ancient temple architecture used for public rituals and ceremonies.
The name draws inspiration from the Anubhav Mandapam, a 12th-century concept promoted by Lord Basaveshwara as a space for open public discussion. The venue is intended to serve as a forum for dialogue.
3. Inspired by a river
The design competition in 2016 was won by Sanjay Singh of Arcop Associates (Delhi) and Simon Nunez of Aedas (Singapore). Their concept was inspired by the Yamuna River, which once flowed close to the site.
The building’s elliptical form mirrors the river’s movement and is shaped like a shankha, or conch shell, a symbol in Hindu tradition. It has no designated front or rear entrance and appears the same from every side, reflecting equality and inclusivity.
4. Larger than the Sydney Opera House
The main convention hall can seat up to 7,000 people in a single format. The Sydney Opera House has a combined seating capacity of about 5,500 across its venues.
The complex also includes a 3,000-seat open-air amphitheatre, six exhibition halls covering 150,000 square metres, and a total built-up area of 390,000 square metres. It was built at a cost of around Rs 2,700 crore, or about $325 million.
5. A ‘window to Delhi’
On the fourth floor is a 120-metre-long lobby with floor-to-ceiling glass offering views of Kartavya Path, the India Gate canopy, and the domes of Rashtrapati Bhawan.
The feature was designed as a tribute to its location near Lutyens’ Delhi. Delegates can view one of the capital’s most recognised skylines from this space.
6. From inauguration to G20
Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated Bharat Mandapam on July 26, 2023, marking Kargil Vijay Diwas.
Just 45 days later, it hosted the 19th G20 Summit on September 9 and 10, welcoming leaders including US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and French President Emmanuel Macron.
7. Hosting AI Impact Summit
From February 16 to 20, 2026, Bharat Mandapam is hosting the India AI Impact Summit. More than 250,000 visitors, over 100 countries and global technology leaders such as Google CEO Sundar Pichai and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman are attending.
In less than three years since its inauguration, the venue has hosted both a G20 Summit and a major global AI gathering.

TITLE: India May Attract USD 200 Billion In AI Investments In Next Two Years: Ashwini Vaishnaw
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/over-200-billion-investment-expected-vaishnaw-on-indias-ai-push-ws-l-9909439.html
--------------------
Union Minister for Electronics and IT Ashwini Vaishnaw on Tuesday said India is expecting more than USD 200 billion in investments over the next two years, underscoring growing global interest in the country’s artificial intelligence and deep tech ecosystem.
“There are two types of interest. The first type is investment. There is an expectation of more than 200 billion dollars in investment over the next two years. The second type is deep tech funding by VC. And the third type is India’s innovativeness and India’s digital public infrastructure," Vaishnaw told ANI on the sidelines of the India AI Impact Summit at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi.
Elaborating on how India’s digital framework is accelerating adoption, he said, “Because of the digital public infrastructure, there is a very good technology framework under the leadership of the Prime Minister. Because of this framework, the diffusion of AI in India can be accelerated. This is what everyone believes."
The minister noted strong interest from global CEOs, particularly in deep tech startups and infrastructure projects. “A lot of interest in investing in India, especially in the Indian deep tech startups, in the infra, also in finding new solutions at population scale. Because the way our Honorable Prime Minister Narendra Modi has created this digital public infrastructure in our country, that brings out a huge advantage for any solution which needs to be brought at a population scale," he said.
Highlighting the enthusiasm around the summit, Vaishnaw said participation has been overwhelming, especially among youth and researchers. “There is a lot of excitement in AI Summit. More than 300,000 youth and researchers and students have registered. And all the sessions are going full. They are houseful. There is a lot of excitement, And especially among the youth. Through this summit, there is a new energy all over the country. By using AI, how to solve big problems on a population scale, such excitement is seen here among the youth," he said.
He also emphasised the need to balance innovation with safeguards. “By balancing these two, we have to move forward with this new technology," he noted, referring to solving large-scale economic and social challenges while mitigating risks.
The India AI Impact Summit has brought together policymakers, industry leaders, investors and innovators to discuss leveraging artificial intelligence for economic growth and social transformation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to deliver the inaugural address on Thursday, setting the tone for enhanced global cooperation and India’s vision for inclusive and development-focused AI.

TITLE: When Dues Go Unpaid: Court Locks Railway Office Over Farmer Compensation
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/when-dues-go-unpaid-court-locks-railway-office-over-farmer-compensation-skn-ws-l-9909383.html
--------------------
In a striking display of judicial enforcement, the Senior Section Engineer’s (SSE) office of the Railway Department in Srirangapatna, Karnataka was seized on Wednesday after officials failed to settle a long-standing compensation debt owed to a local farmer.
The dispute dates back to the land acquisition process for the Bengaluru-Mysuru double-track railway project. During the expansion, the Railway Department acquired agricultural land belonging to Mahadevaiah, a resident of Baburayanakoppal village.
While the land was taken for public infrastructure, the compensation provided was far below the market value. As per the then prices of land in the area, the compensation agreed upon to be paid by Railway Department was Rs 50 lakh but it was never paid in full.
Seeking fair treatment, Mahadevaiah moved the court to demand enhanced compensation. Following a prolonged legal battle, the court ruled in his favour, ordering the Railway Department to pay the remaining balance along with accrued interest, totaling several lakhs of rupees.
The Seizure: Furniture and Computers Confiscated
Despite the clear judicial mandate and multiple follow-up notices, the railway authorities failed to release the funds. Exhausting his options, the farmer filed an Execution Petition (EP), prompting the court to authorize the attachment of the department’s movable property.
On Wednesday, court bailiffs arrived at the SSE office located near the Srirangapatna railway station. When officials were unable to produce the payment, the staff began clearing the office of its essential assets. The confiscated items included:
The Aftermath
The seized assets were loaded into vehicles and transported to the court premises. Court officials have made it clear that if the compensation is not disbursed immediately, they will proceed with the next phase of legal attachment, which could include more significant departmental assets.
The incident has resonated strongly with the local farming community, serving as a rare example of a common citizen successfully holding a major government entity accountable through the power of the judiciary.

--------------------
With a global assembly of Presidents, Prime Ministers, technology pioneers and thousands of attendees from global tech firms in attendance, Day 1 of the India AI Impact Summit 2026 in New Delhi saw unprecedented energy.
But the bevvy of world leaders, industry experts, policymakers and dignitaries for the world’s largest artificial intelligence summit at the Bharat Mandapam also means large crowds and some delays which the attendees should account for.
Among the issues attendees need to brace for are security sweeps for high-level arrivals. Also, with the heightened interest, certain sessions saw more than expected participants, causing disappointment among those who couldn’t join.
Steps have been taken to ease congestion and improve coordination for better crowd flow and access management, organisers were reported as saying.
One such instance was reported by Maitreya Wagh, CEO and one of the founders of Bolna AI, who couldn’t access his booth at the summit owing to the gates being shut.
Wagh wrote on X: “Gates are closed so could not access my own booth at the AI Summit. If you’re also stuck outside and wanted to visit the @bolna_dev team, dm me. We may set up a mini-booth at some Connaught Place café."

The sudden evacuation stumped Dhananjay Yadav, co-founder and CEO of Neo Sapien. He also complained of confusing directions.
“We paid for flights, accommodation, logistics and even the booth. Only to see our wearables disappear inside a high-security zone. If only security and official entourage had access, how did this happen? This is extremely disappointing," he wrote on X.
Day 1 of the AI Impact Summit turned to be a pain for us.I came genuinely excited, it was the first time the summit was being hosted in India, and I wanted to show up personally to support the ecosystem and the government’s push.
But what happened next was shocking.

Punit Jain, founder of Reskill, complained of the limited access.
“If access was limited to select guests, it should have been communicated upfront," he said.

A Reuters report said some journalists covering the summit spent much of Monday seeking clarity on entry procedures, with confusion over separate digital QR codes and physical passes for access, according to messages in a WhatsApp group for the event.
Several exhibitors at the summit, however, called these logistical issues teething problems, which would be resolved soon.
Spread across 10 arenas covering more than 70,000 square metres, the Expo brings together global technology firms, start-ups, academia, research institutions, Union Ministries, State Governments, and international partners.The event features 13 country pavilions showcasing international collaboration from nations including Australia, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Serbia, Estonia, Tajikistan, and Africa.
Expecting 2.5 lakh visitors, the Expo hosts over 300 curated exhibition pavilions and live demonstrations, organised into three thematic chakras: People, Planet, and Progress.
In addition, it features over 600 high-potential start-ups, many of which are building globally relevant and population-scale solutions already deployed in real-world settings.
The massive scale of the event is further highlighted by over 500 sessions featuring more than 3,250 visionary speakers and panel members.
Running until February 20, the Impact Summit and Expo showcase New Delhi’s ambition to shape an AI future that is inclusive, responsible, and impactful, anchored in the Prime Minister’s broader vision for sovereign AI that benefits every global citizen.
Final two days of the Summit — February 19 and 20 — will see more than 20 heads of state and government, including France’s Emmanuel Macron and Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, along with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, talking about the future of AI alongside business leaders and investors.

--------------------
Billionaire Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates will attend the AI Impact Summit and deliver his keynote address as scheduled, his spokesperson clarified on Tuesday, putting to rest speculation over his participation.
The clarification comes after reports suggested that Gates was not attending the ongoing AI Summit in Delhi, following his name reportedly missing from the event’s ‘Global Visionaries’ list. Government sources had earlier told News18 that Gates was not part of the summit due to “unavoidable reasons" amid the fallout related to the Epstein files.
“India is a global leader in artificial intelligence, powered by one of the world’s largest AI talent pools, rapid adoption across sectors, and innovation at a population scale. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, AI has become central to India’s vision of Viksit Bharat, driving inclusive growth and responsible innovation," the Gates Foundation mentioned in X.
“India’s distinctive public-private model, bringing together government, startups, academia, and industry, is proving that AI can be built for impact, for inclusion, and for the world," it further added.
Late last week, Nvidia said its CEO Jensen Huang will not travel to India to attend the Summit. Huang was one of the biggest attractions at the Summit.
The development coincides with Gates’ visit to India. He had earlier travelled to Andhra Pradesh, where he lauded the state’s growth driven by AI and technology. Following his visit to Amaravati, Gates expressed admiration for the southern state’s innovations in health, agriculture and education.
The AI Impact Summit 2026 at Bharat Mandapam was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, highlighting India’s commitment to responsible and inclusive Artificial Intelligence. The summit brings together policymakers, technology companies, innovators, academia and industry leaders, aiming to translate global AI discussions into actionable development outcomes under the IndiaAI Mission and the Digital India initiative.

Macron India Visit, PM Modi Meeting, AI Summit Updates: French President Emmanuel Macron arrived in Mumbai on Monday night along with First Lady Brigitte Macron on a three-day official visit to India. The French President and the First Lady were received by Maharashtra Governor Acharya Devvrat and Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis at the Mumbai airport.
Macron met Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Lok Bhavan where he discussed artificial intelligence and strategic cooperation. A key focus was renewed push for bilateral defence cooperation, including joint manufacturing of helicopters and HAMMER precision-guided missiles.
Notably, this visit marks Macron’s fourth visit to the country at the invitation of PM Modi, signaling sustained momentum in the India-France strategic partnership, with a particular focus on Artificial Intelligence (AI) cooperation and emerging technologies.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday announced that 2026 will be celebrated as the India-France Year of Innovation, following discussions with French President Emmanuel Macron at the inauguration of the India–France Innovation Forum.

President Macron said, “In the past eight years, India and France have collaborated in several sectors, and we are happy turn this partnership into a special strategic partnership.”
He said that apart from defence, there are several other sectors where India and France can collaborate, such as the space program.
PM Narendra Modi said, “India and France both believe in democratic values, the rule of law, and a multipolar world. We are unanimous that reform of global institutions will solve global challenges. We will continue to support all efforts for peace in every region, be it Ukraine, West Asia, or the Indo-Pacific. We share a common commitment to eradicate terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.”
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, “Today we are strengthening our cooperation in critical minerals, biotechnology, and advanced materials. We are launching the Indo-French Centre for AI in Health, the Indo-French Centre for Digital Science and Technology, and the National Centre of Alliance for Skilling in Aeronautics. These are not just institutes, they are future-building platforms. Friends, the world is facing a period of uncertainty. In this environment, the India-France partnership is a force for global stability. We are combining France’s expertise and India’s scale. We are developing trusted technologies. We will ensure human development through the International Solar Alliance, the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, and joint development projects, and will continue to strengthen efforts for stability and prosperity through multilateralism, dialogue, and diplomacy.”
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, “I am delighted to welcome my dear friend, President Macron, to Mumbai. Last year, he invited me to the AI ​​Action Committee Summit in France. At that time, we visited Marseille, France’s largest port and a major gateway to France and all of Europe. Marseille is the city from where our Indian soldiers set foot in Europe during World War I. Their saga of bravery is still remembered in many parts of Europe, and it is the same city where freedom fighter Veer Savarkar jumped into the sea to escape the British. His action symbolised his unwavering resolve for India’s independence. I had the opportunity to remember and pay my respects to him in Marseille last year. This time, when President Macron is in India for the AI ​​Impact Summit, we are fortunate to welcome him in Mumbai, the gateway to India.”
India and France have also signed an agreement to promote mutual investment and avoid double taxation. PM Modi also announced the launch of the India–France Year of Innovation. He said innovation grows through collaboration and stronger people-to-people ties.
The goal, he added, is to transform the strategic partnership into a true “Partnership of the People,” paving the way for shared prosperity.
In a major announcement, PM Modi said India and France will jointly manufacture in India the world’s only helicopter capable of flying to the heights of Mount Everest.
The helicopter will be made in India and exported worldwide.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that India and France share a “very special relationship,” calling France one of India’s oldest and most trusted strategic partners. He said that both leaders have worked together to give the partnership “unprecedented depth and energy.”
He announced that India and France are now elevating their ties to a Special Global Strategic Partnership.
While addressing a joint press conference With Macron, PM Modi said that 2026 is a landmark year in the evolution of India’s engagement with Europe. According to him, this year marks a decisive shift—from steady cooperation to transformative partnership.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday held wide-ranging talks with French President Emmanuel Macron to boost ties in key sectors such as trade, defence, energy and critical technologies.
After the talks with Modi, Macron will attend a ceremony to launch the India-France Year of Innovation.
His visit comes days after India cleared a long-pending proposal to procure 114 Rafale fighter jets under a government-to-government framework with France.
It has been billed as one of the world’s biggest military procurement programmes in recent years.
The leaders will also inaugurate the India-France Year of Innovation 2026 and address a gathering of business leaders, start-ups, researchers, and other innovators from both countries.

Bill Gates ‌will not appear at the India ​AI Impact Summit on ⁠Thursday (February 18, 2026) to deliver his keynote address, dealing another blow to an event already ‌marred by organisational lapses, a robot snafu and delegate ‌complaints over VIP traffic disruptions.
No reason ‌was ⁠given. But the Gates ⁠Foundation said the billionaire will not deliver his address “to ensure the focus remains on the ​AI Summit’s ‌key priorities”.
“After careful consideration, and to ensure the focus remains on the AI Summit’s key priorities, Mr. Gates will not be delivering his keynote address. The Gates Foundation remains fully committed to our work in India to advance our shared health and development goals,” the foundation said in a statement.
The cancellation comes after the U.S. Department of Justice released emails last month that included ‌communication between late financier and convicted ​sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and the foundation’s staff.
The documents ⁠indicate Gates and Epstein met repeatedly after Epstein’s prison term to discuss ‌expanding Gates’ philanthropic efforts. Gates has said the relationship was confined to philanthropy-related discussions and that it was a mistake for him to meet with Epstein.
The Gates ‌Foundation, the philanthropic organisation started by Microsoft ​co-founder Bill Gates and his then-wife in 2000, is one ⁠of the world’s biggest funders of ⁠global health initiatives. Bill Gates is chair and a board member ‌of the foundation.

Google said it would build new subsea cables from India and chip titan Nvidia unveiled tie-ups with computing firms on Wednesday as tech giants rushed to announce deals and investments at a global AI conference in New Delhi.
This week's AI Impact Summit is the fourth annual gathering to discuss how to govern the fast-evolving technology, and also an opportunity for India to raise its profile in the booming sector.
"India's going to have an extraordinary trajectory with AI and we want to be a partner," Google CEO Sundar Pichai told reporters as the US firm unveiled a plan to boost connectivity to the South Asian country.
New direct undersea connections from India to Singapore, South Africa and Australia will be constructed, it said, touting faster connections as demand for computing power, including AI, ramps up.
It is part of Google's $15 billion investment announced in October to construct its largest AI data centre hub outside the United States, in Visakhapatnam, a port city in the southeastern state of Andhra Pradesh.
Also on Wednesday, the California-based Nvidia, the world's most valuable company, said it was teaming up with three Indian cloud computing providers to provide advanced processors for data centres that can train and run AI systems.
Dozens of world leaders and ministerial delegations are in New Delhi for the summit to discuss the opportunities and threats, from job losses to misinformation, that AI poses.
Last year India leapt to third place, overtaking South Korea and Japan, in an annual global ranking of AI competitiveness calculated by Stanford University researchers.
But despite its plans for large-scale infrastructure and grand ambitions for innovation, experts say the country has a long way to go before it can rival the United States and China.
The AI conference has brought a flurry of deals, with IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw saying Tuesday that India expects more than $200 billion in investments over the next two years, including roughly $90 billion already committed.
Mumbai cloud and data centre provider L&T said Wednesday it was teaming up with Nvidia to build what it touted as "India's largest gigawatt-scale AI factory".
"We are laying the foundation for world-class AI infrastructure that will power India's growth," said Nvidia boss Jensen Huang in a statement that did not put a figure on the investment.
Nvidia is also working with other Indian AI infrastructure players such as Yotta, which announced a $2 billion deal with the US company that will provide it with 20,000 top-end AI processors.
Nvidia's Huang is not attending the AI summit but other top US tech figures joining include OpenAI's Sam Altman, Meta chief AI officer Alexandr Wang and Microsoft founder Bill Gates.
Microsoft said it was investing $50 billion this decade to boost AI adoption in developing countries, while US artificial intelligence startup Anthropic and Indian IT giant Infosys said they would build AI agents for the telecoms industry.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other world leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron and Brazil's Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva are expected to deliver a statement at the end of the week about how they plan to address concerns raised by AI technology.
But experts say the broad focus of the event and vague promises made at previous global AI summits in France, South Korea and Britain mean that concrete commitments are unlikely.
Nick Patience, practice lead for AI at tech research group Futurum, told AFP that nonbinding declarations could still "set the tone for what acceptable AI governance looks like".
But "the largest AI companies deploy capabilities at a pace that makes 18-month legislative cycles look glacial," Patience said.
"So it's a case of whether governments can converge fast enough to create meaningful guardrails before de facto standards are set by the companies themselves."

Gujarat Finance Minister Kanubhai Desai on Wednesday (February 18, 2026) tabled the State Budget for the financial year 2026–27 in the State Assembly, focusing on digital governance, tourism promotion, and creation of sports infrastructure ahead of the 2030 Commonwealth Games.
With a total outlay of ₹4,08,053 crore, the budget is the largest ever presented in the State’s history. It focuses on regional growth, welfare initiatives, and sector-specific investments.
The announcement came weeks after the Union Budget was presented on February 1, amid keen interest over the State’s fiscal priorities and development roadmap for the coming year. In a notable visual departure, the budget document cover features Kansari Devi, a tribal goddess, illustrated in the traditional Warli art style.
The Budget, with an estimated surplus of ₹974 crore and no new taxes, continued the 5% tax rebate for electric vehicles. This fiscal year, ₹63,184 crore was allotted to the Education department, followed by ₹33,504 crore to the Urban Development department and ₹29,709 crore to the Roads and Buildings department. The total outlay increased by 10.2% (₹3,70,250 crore) to ₹4,08,053 crore over the previous financial year, Mr. Desai said.
On the sports front, the Budget outlines an ambitious roadmap to develop Ahmedabad as an “Olympic Ready City” in the run-up to the 2030 Commonwealth Games, which Gujarat will host. A total of ₹1,278 crore has been proposed for Games-related infrastructure, including international-standard sports complexes and stadiums, as well as improved urban transport connectivity around key venues.
The sports department has been allocated ₹1,331 crore overall. Of this, ₹500 crore will be used for developing Ahmedabad as an Olympic-ready destination and for the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel (SVP) Sports Enclave. Additionally, ₹165 crore has been set aside for building and upgrading sports complexes in districts across the State.
The Budget also provides ₹100 crore each for developing Olympic-level sports infrastructure at Karai and for establishing a Para High Performance Centre in Gandhinagar, along with ₹90 crore for constructing a world-class hockey stadium.
Tourism and sports infrastructure emerged as key pillars of the State Budget, with substantial allocations aimed at boosting Gujarat’s global profile.

Declaring 2026 as ‘Gujarat Tourism Year’, the Finance Minister said the State intends to secure a stronger presence on national and international tourism maps. To support this push, ₹236 crore has been allocated for upgrading infrastructure in and around the Statue of Unity, which the government said has become a major global attraction while generating employment, particularly for tribal communities.
Further, ₹300 crore has been proposed under the Ambaji Corridor Masterplan for the comprehensive development of the Ambaji pilgrimage centre. An additional ₹447 crore has been earmarked for constructing iconic bus stations at Somnath and Ambaji and for developing a multi-modal transport hub at Somnath.
Reaffirming its focus on long-term growth, the Finance Minister said the government remains committed to creating world-class infrastructure that supports economic expansion while advancing Gujarat’s cultural and sporting ambitions on the global stage.
The Budget estimates an overall surplus of ₹974 crore, reflecting what the government described as prudent fiscal management.
In a push towards technology-driven governance, over ₹850 crore has been allocated for Artificial Intelligence and digital governance initiatives. The government plans to establish a Gujarat Unified Digital Stack to integrate and deliver citizen services through a single platform. In addition, a Data Fusion Centre and a Centre of Excellence will be set up to leverage AI for enhancing safety and security mechanisms.
Digital “lake and air-watch systems” will be introduced for monitoring air and water quality.
On the taxation front, the Minister proposed extending the 5% rebate on Motor Vehicle Tax for electric vehicles for another year. The continuation of the incentive is expected to provide relief of ₹210 crore to citizens and further encourage the adoption of electric mobility in the State.
The Finance Minister said the Budget has been structured around five key pillars — social security, human resource development, infrastructure expansion, economic growth and green growth — to provide a balanced framework for the State’s progress.
He stated that the overarching objective of these focus areas is to fast-track Gujarat’s transformation into a developed state by 2047, aligning policy priorities with long-term developmental goals.

The two-day Tamil Nadu Climate Summit 4.0 brought together global institutions, national experts, State departments, field officers, and community partners to take stock of Tamil Nadu’s five-year climate journey.
With the Day two of the Summit opening with a session titled “Voices from the Field – Strengthening Climate Resilient Ecosystems”, which was science-driven and field-informed, one of the segments focused on forest-fire preparedness in a “warming world”.
The discussion circled around India’s leadership at the Seventh United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA-7), where it piloted and secured adoption of a resolution calling for strengthened international collaboration on wildfires. The “Tamil Nadu experience” was presented as a model of anticipatory governance: the government has established a State-Level Command and Control Centre in Chennai, complemented by district-level control rooms to monitor forest fires through real-time data streams, satellite inputs and rapid-response coordination.
The government’s decentralised, yet integrated architecture, ensures scientific monitoring, early detection, and minimal response time. The session highlighted investments in first-responder training, capacity building, modern fire-fighting equipment and mobility infrastructure.
The Summit also touched upon “Biodiversity and Climate Change”, which brought into focus the accelerating loss of biodiversity due to habitat fragmentation, urbanisation, pollution and climate variability.
The dialogue then moved towards circularity and the green economy, anchoring climate action in resource efficiency and waste transformation.

--------------------
On ‘Sindhanai Sirpi’ Singaravelar’s 167th birth anniversary on Wednesday, fishermen from hamlets in and around the city, took an oath to oppose projects like Blue Economy and TN Shore as they do not seem to ‘bother’ about the welfare of the fisher community.
“These projects only aim at economic development through tourism, ports, ship building activities, and assistance for large fishing companies. We are being side-lined. These projects do not speak about long-term measures for issues like rising sea-level and coastal erosion. Fishing hamlets are the first to get affected in the event of any natural disaster on the coast. There are no systems in place for our safety,” said fishing community leader K. Bharathi.
Kabaddi Maran, a community leader, said that both Central and State governments were vying with each other to make money out of the coast in the name of economic development. Artisanal fishermen and even those with mechanised boats were suffering due to dwindling catch. The governments were not bothered about the welfare of fishermen, he charged.

TITLE: ​Troubled waters: On the Great Nicobar Project
LINK: https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/troubled-waters-on-the-great-nicobar-project/article70648264.ece
--------------------
Proponents of the controversial Great Nicobar Project will be enthused by an order from the Kolkata bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) ruling that all environmental safeguards are in place, that the potential impact of this gargantuan project on resident native populations of the region is duly accounted for, and the project’s “strategic utility” is reason enough for the government to not be fully transparent with what it shares in the public domain. But the dominant narrative around the project mirrors the classic development versus environment conflict of a pristine Pandora being ravaged for the greed of far-away mainlanders. The Great Nicobar Island Project (GNIP) envisages a trans-shipment port, an international airport, township development, and a 450 Megavolt-Amperes (MVA) gas and solar-based power plant. In the early 20th century, the British Phosphate Commissioners (a joint venture of the U.K., Australia, and New Zealand) began large-scale phosphate mining for fertilizer on Nauru and Banaba in the Pacific Ocean. By 1945, the island had been so physically devastated by strip mining that it was deemed uninhabitable. The native Banabans were forcibly relocated to Rabi Island in Fiji, over 2,000 kilometres away. Today, Banaba is a desolate landscape of jagged limestone “pinnacles” and the displaced population is fighting for the rehabilitation of its homeland. These serve as historical precedents for why economic logic alone cannot dictate actions in remote territories. Though accorded an environment and preliminary forest clearance by the Union Environment Ministry, concerns about the potential loss of biodiversity, tree-felling, and impact on resident tribes prompted the NGT to order a review of the environmental aspects of the project.
Independent scientists and environmentalist groups have said that the felling of tracts of pristine tropical forest — nearly nine lakh trees across 130 sq.km — for this project would significantly harm the biodiversity of the region and constitute an irreparable loss. This is not counting the disturbance to leatherback turtle nesting grounds and the assault on the corals. There was also the contested matter of whether the community rights of the local Shompen and the Nicobarese tribes were fully settled under the requirements of the Forest Rights Act. Recently, members of the Tribal Council said they were being coerced to sign “surrender certificates” that implied their consent to large parts of their land being diverted for the project. The NGT order essentially rubber-stamps the government’s appraisal process without independently examining the concerns raised. It only imposes faith that the government will be a conscientious executor of the project. Whether the Great Nicobar Project is a ‘net good’ can only be judged by future generations, but the lack of a process that offers a fair appraisal of independent concerns bodes ill for the present.

--------------------
The Andhra Pradesh government would further simplify the process of removing eligible private lands from the 22A prohibited list to benefit the poor and prevent inconvenience to genuine landowners, Revenue, Registration and Stamps Minister Anagani Satya Prasad informed the Assembly on Wednesday.
Replying to questions from TDP MLA Kolikapudi Srinivasa Rao and BJP MLA P. Vishnu Kumar Raju, the Minister said a memo had already been issued permitting deletion of five categories of private lands from the prohibited list.
Speaker Ch. Ayyanna Patrudu noted that 22A land issues persist across the State and stressed effective implementation of guidelines.
The Minister said a team, comprising the Special Chief Secretary (Revenue) and senior officials, was periodically reviewing the matter. Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu ha directed that 22A issues be resolved in a manner beneficial to the poor, while protecting public interest. A special drive involving in-charge Ministers and District Collectors would be launched to expedite eligible deletions.
On alleged encroachment of government land in Ramannapalem village of Tiruvuru mandal, he said the matter was under court litigation. Regarding assigned lands to ex-servicemen in Visakhapatnam, he clarified they could be sold after 10 years, but water bodies must be protected in line with court orders.
Meanwhile, R&B Minister B.C. Janardhan Reddy said tree removal during road expansion was being carried out strictly as per norms. Under the leadership of Mr. Naidu and Deputy Chief Minister K. Pawan Kalyan, the government was prioritising environmental conservation, avenue plantations and translocation of large trees, wherever feasible.

The Kerala government moved the Supreme Court on Wednesday (February 18, 2026) against a State High Court decision to keep in abeyance the ‘Nava Keralam Citizen Response Programme’, a public outreach and development feedback initiative to obtain suggestions from the public on development and welfare measures.
The special leave petition filed by the State government, represented by advocate C.K. Sasi, submitted that the High Court intruded into matters of public policy not only to stall a programme approved by the council of Ministers of the State but further to set aside consequential financial sanction and budgetary proceedings.
“The High Court interfered with the government’s power to implement governance and development outreach programmes and seriously prejudiced the ability of the State to take policy decisions involving public expenditure and thus disturbed the constitutional balance between the executive and judiciary,” the petition submitted.
The Kerala government said the programme was envisaged as a time-bound statewide exercise to be conducted from January 2026 to February 2026 for collection of public opinion and suggestions regarding development and welfare schemes through a multi-level mechanism involving State, district and local-level coordination, as well as volunteers drawn from the Social Volunteer Force portal.
The State submitted that approximately ₹20 crores under the Budget head ‘Special PR Campaign’’ was set aside for the conduct of the programme. The financial sanction for the programme was done by the State’s Information and Public Relations Department in October last year and proceedings detailing the tentative budgetary allocation and expenditure components were issued subsequently in November 2025..
The High Court’s intervention was on the basis of a writ petition alleging that the programme violated the Rules of Business framed under Article 166(3) of the Constitution in as much as the subject matter of the programme relating to collection of development inputs and evaluation of welfare schemes fell within the domain of departments, and not the Information and Public Relations Department.
The writ petitioners had contended that the allocation of ₹20 crore amounted to diversion or misuse of public funds and required legislative sanction under Articles 202 to 205 of the Constitution.
The State had countered that the programme had received Cabinet approval and that administrative and financial sanction had been granted along with detailed budgetary proceedings.
It had argued that the Information and Public Relations Department was competent to implement the programme. “The High Court failed to appreciate that the Rules of Business are internal executive instructions intended for convenient transaction of governmental business and are directory in nature. Non-compliance with such internal allocation of business does not ipso facto render executive action void,” the appeal in the apex court argued.
The High Court had failed to appreciate that the provisions of the Kerala Budget Manual and other internal fiscal norms were executive guidelines without statutory force, and cannot be treated as mandatory provisions whose alleged violation would invalidate governmental action, the petition said.
It said that internal fiscal instructions cannot be elevated to the status of enforceable law by the court in judicial review.

India has added its name to the list of countries criticising Israel for its unilateral measures on the West Bank. India had not joined the original group of 85 countries that announced the statement on Tuesday (February 17, 2026)
The statement was endorsed by the League of Arab States; the European Union; BRICS founder members Russia, China, Brazil, and South Africa; India’s Quad partners Australia and Japan; and neighbouring countries, including Bangladesh, the Maldives, Mauritius, and Pakistan. It came just ahead of a UN meeting on the issue and the U.S.-led Board of Peace meeting in Washington on Thursday.
The joint statement was issued at a “stakeout” on Tuesday (February 17, 2026), and it was read out by the Palestinian Ambassador to the UN, flanked by diplomats from dozens of countries that co-signed the document.
Just in- India adds name to list of countries criticising Israel for unilateral measures on West Bank. India had not joined the original group of 85 countries that announced the statement on Tuesday, signs onto statement 24hrs later. https://t.co/A8wstsvxYJ
“We strongly condemn unilateral Israeli decisions and measures aimed at expanding Israel’s unlawful presence in the West Bank,” Palestinian Ambassador to the UN Riyad Mansour said.
“We underline in this regard our strong opposition to any form of annexation,” Mr. Mansour said, adding that the statement rejected all measures “aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem”.
Over the past few months, following the ceasefire in Gaza, the Israeli Knesset has passed a number of plans to tighten its control over land in the Palestinian West Bank’s “A” and “B” Areas, which have been administered by the Palestinian Authority since the Oslo Accords (1993-1995). Among the measures are the removal of restrictions on the acquisition of land by outsiders and the checking of documentation for those currently living on the land, which is seen as a precursor to occupying and annexing the territory, as Israeli settlers have done elsewhere.
“Such measures violate international law, undermine the ongoing efforts for peace and stability in the region, run counter to the Comprehensive Plan and jeopardise the prospect of reaching a peace agreement ending the conflict,” the statement said.
Prior to the development, the absence of India’s name in the statement drew strong criticism from diplomats on social media. Former Ambassador to Iran K.C. Singh called it “regrettable that India has chosen Israeli corner so blatantly” and questioned whether the move was also linked to help India’s ties with the U.S.
“Strategic autonomy was meant to expand India’s choices, not shrink its moral vocabulary. If autonomy turns into avoidance of normative positions altogether, it starts looking less like independence and more like hedging,” wrote former Foreign Secretary Nirupama Menon Rao, referring to India’s normal positions on the Israel-Palestine conflict.
On January 31, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar had hosted a meeting of the League of Arab States and met Palestinian Foreign Minister Varsen Aghabekian Shahin. It is unclear whether Mr. Jaishankar discussed Mr. Modi’s upcoming visit to Israel, his first since July 2017, and whether Mr. Modi was also planning a trip to Palestine subsequently as he had in February 2018.
The visit to Israel has been under discussion for some weeks and comes after Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu put off his visit to India last November, reportedly for security reasons. Mr. Modi’s travel to Israel will also come weeks after the release of the “Epstein files” in the U.S., where the late American investor and convicted sex offender Jeffery Epstein had claimed in correspondence with a Qatari interlocutor that Mr. Modi “danced and sang” at the behest of U.S. President Donald Trump (in his previous tenure), an allegation the External Affairs Ministry denied strongly.

The second phase of the Vibrant Village Programme (VVP) will cover 1,954 strategic villages along the land borders with Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Myanmar in 15 States and two Union Territories, according to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).
The VVP was launched in 2023, originally to assist development in villages along the China border. The VVP-II was cleared by the Union Cabinet in April 2025.
On February 20, Home Minister Amit Shah is likely to launch the VVP-II programme at Nathanpur village in Assam’s Cachar district along the Bangladesh border.
The Ministry said that often, residents of the border villages may resort to illicit activities, petty crimes, connive in trans-border crimes, and are prone to migrating to urban areas, creating a vacuum that leads to demographic changes and illegal migration. “The VVP programme envisages ensuring assimilation of the border population with the nation, and inculcate them as eyes and ears of the border guarding forces (BGFs), create better living conditions and adequate livelihood opportunities, and wean away the border population from inimical activities,” the Ministry said.
The government also plans “culturally sensitive” border-specific outreach activities to engage with communities who live near international borders to build trust, provide information, and encourage cooperation “These activities will foster a positive relationship between border guarding agencies and local population, and promote a sense of shared responsibility in border management,” the MHA said in its guidelines shared with the States.
While VVP-I was aimed at villages along the China border, the phase two with a total outlay of ₹6,839 crore shall be implemented in select strategic villages in Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Punjab, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal till the financial year 2028-29. It is proposed that ₹3 crore will be spent in each village.
The Ministry said the main objective of the VVP-II is to meet the developmental needs and well-being of the border population, as wells as promote diverse livelihood opportunities to ensure economic and cultural assimilation with the nation’s overall growth story. “In these villages, opportunities for professional growth, social cohesion and national integration would be enhanced to ensure that border regions are not left behind in the country’s development journey and would be developed as growth centres,” the MHA said.
The strategy includes saturation of existing schemes of the government to eligible individual beneficiaries and households, strengthen basic infrastructure and create enabling infrastructure and capacities to increase livelihood opportunities.
The purpose of the outreach activities would be to ﻿build trust between border control agencies and local communities by providing clear and accurate information about border security procedures, immigration laws, encourage active participation from border communities in reporting suspicious activities and contributing to overall security efforts.

Around 2,000 security personnel, led by the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), launched an operation on Tuesday (February 17, 2026) along the Chhattisgarh-Telangana border to track down senior Maoist commanders, a senior CRPF official said on Wednesday (February 18, 2026).
The operation, codenamed “KGH-2”, is underway in the Nambi and Korgotalu Hills region and forms part of the Union Government’s declared objective of eradicating Left-Wing Extremism (LWE) from the country by March 2026.
According to the official, the number of politburo and central committee members of the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist)—the highest decision-making body—has come down to four from 20 in January 2025.
Security forces are searching for four senior leaders: Ganapati, Devuji, Malla Raja Reddy and Misir Besra. In the ongoing operation, security personnel are looking for central committee member Devji alias Chetan and junior cadre Kesa Sodhi, the official said.
The CRPF is the lead force in implementing government schemes in Maoist-affected areas. Recently, the Chhattisgarh Government designated CRPF company locations in interior areas as “Integrated Centres” for implementing the “Niyad Nellanar Yojna”, a multi-dimensional developmental initiative.
According to the CRPF, the number of districts categorised as Maoist-affected declined from 18 at the beginning of 2025 to eight by year-end.
The paramilitary force said targeting Maoist leadership is part of its broader combat strategy aimed at weakening the organisation’s operational capabilities. In 2025, 12 senior Maoist leaders were neutralised, and five others surrendered amid intensified operations.
In all, 370 Maoists were killed in operations conducted by the CRPF, 1,175 ultras or their sympathisers were apprehended, and 2,391 extremists surrendered.
“As part of the combat strategy, CRPF has identified the strongholds of Maoists, and it was decided to establish launch pads/FOBs with the intention to disrupt supply chains and the launching of operations. In 2025, 61 forward operating bases were established in core areas, including 32 in Chhattisgarh, 9 in Jharkhand, 4 in Odisha, 4 in Maharashtra, 11 in Madhya Pradesh and one in Telangana,” CRPF said.

The 15th State Investment Promotion Board (SIPB) meeting held under the chairmanship of Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu at the Secretariat on Wednesday approved 27 projects with an investment of ₹29,021 crore, taking the total investments approved so far to ₹9,03,726 crore.
Mr. Naidu made it clear that the Speed of Doing Business policy should be the guiding principle in all matters related to industrial projects. He emphasised that mega projects by reputed companies such as Google, ArcelorMittal and BPCL were in the pipeline and instructed officials to ensure that they faced no hurdles from the government.   Approvals should be cancelled if any company fails to start work, he told the Ministers’ Committee.
Mr. Naidu said the government was ready to offer special incentives to attract more semiconductor projects and suggested that a proposal to give additional incentives for projects being set up on private lands should be examined. He said tourism should be developed in Visakhapatnam, Amaravati, and Tirupati regions in a cluster-based approach.
Mr. Naidu noted that value addition in aquaculture would help revive exports to the U.S.A. and boost dairy, poultry, livestock, and meat exports.
The officials must introduce a warehousing policy and prepare an action plan for setting up electric vehicle charging stations on a large-scale, he said.
Ministers Nara Lokesh, Anagani Satya Prasad, T.G. Bharat, P. Narayana, K. Atchannaidu, Gottipati Ravi Kumar, B.C. Janardhan Reddy, Kandula Durgesh and Vasamsetti Subhash, Chief Secretary K. Vijayanand and other senior officials were present.

--------------------
“As per the Finance Bill 2026, the income tax exemption was granted to only those personnel who were wounded in action and were invalided out from service on receiving a bodily disability,” Chairman of Ex-Serviceman Department AICC Col. Rohit Chaudhary (retd.) said. File photo: AICC via PTI
The Congress on Wednesday (February 18, 2026) criticised the government’s move to levy income tax on disability pensions of disabled armed forces personnel, calling it an “insult” to soldiers’ sacrifice and warning of its impact on morale.
Addressing a press conference, AICC Ex-Servicemen Department chairman Col. (retired) Rohit Chaudhry, along with Col. (retired) S.P. Singh of the Indian Ex-Servicemen League, said that as per the Finance Bill 2026, the income tax exemption was granted to only those personnel who were wounded in action and were invalided out from service on receiving a bodily disability.
Through this clause, the government had removed the income tax exemption from the recipients of disability pension who got bodily injuries during action and were retained in service and also from those who had got the disability attributable to or aggravated due to military service conditions.
The ex-servicemen community urged the government to retain full tax exemption on disability pensions and withdraw the new disability policy introduced in 2023, Col. Chaudhry said.
The party demanded restoration of the status quo under the Income Tax Acts of 1922 and 1961, which kept such pensions tax-exempt.
He said that under both the 1922 and 1961 Income Tax Acts, disability pensions for personnel injured in action or whose disabilities were attributable to or aggravated by service conditions were kept outside the tax net, whether they were invalided out or retained in service.
He alleged that the government had been attempting to tax such pensions since 2016 and had now restricted the exemption, under the Finance Bill 2026, only to those invalided out after being wounded in action.
He said the move would bring under taxation personnel who continued in service despite injuries or those whose disabilities were linked to harsh service conditions.
Referring to the 2023 disability policy, he said the renaming of disability pension as “impairment relief” had effectively made it taxable for new pensioners.
Citing the example of Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw, who rose to the top despite being wounded in battle, Col. Chaudhry said retaining injured soldiers had long been part of military tradition and morale building.
The Congress claimed the decision could affect nearly two lakh disabled soldiers and warned of nationwide protests, beginning at Jantar Mantar on March 1, if the move was not reversed.

--------------------
The Ernakulam District Panchayat’s upcoming Budget is expected to focus on welfare initiatives and addressing the needs of marginalised and disadvantaged communities.
District panchayat president K.G. Radhakrishnan said the Budget would prioritise sectors such as education, geriatric care, agriculture, and palliative care, with special attention to the elderly, differently abled, Scheduled Caste communities, and transgender persons.
In the case of differently abled people, focus will be given to formulating programmes and training methodologies to make them self-sufficient.
Agriculture is another area that will get special focus, said Mr. Radhakrishnan. “When we consider agriculture, we also need to focus on developing value-added products. We are considering identifying one product from each panchayat and promoting it. For instance, we could take the case of Vazhakkulam in Manjalloor panchayat and promote pineapple. Or, there could be panchayats that have ample production of paddy, and this can be promoted. We will focus on one panchayat and one product, brand it that way and focus on value-added products from there,” said Mr. Radhakrishnan.
Special focus will be given to the development of Scheduled Caste communities. In the case of schools, focus will be on ensuring quality education. “We need to make these plans considering the changing environment and technology and equip classrooms with technological tools designed for the present times,” he added.
Mental health and geriatric health will be given primary importance, he said. The key focus will be on creating recreational spaces for the elderly. “We need to create public spaces where they can engage and relax. A large majority of the elderly are facing loneliness and social isolation, and it has to be addressed,” he added.
Farm tourism is another area that is likely to get adequate focus in the Budget.

--------------------
The judges agreed with senior counsel G. Rajagopalan, representing the ECI, that the balance of convenience was actually in favour of the ECI and not in favour of the petitioners.
The Madras High Court on Wednesday refused to stay the orders passed by the Election Commission of India (ECI) recently for de-registering a host of political parties which had not contested either the Legislative Assembly or Parliamentary elections in the last six years.
Chief Justice Manindra Mohan Shrivastava and Justice G. Arul Murugan said no interim order could be passed in favour of the de-registered political parties since it would amount to allowing their writ petitions and permitting them to contest the upcoming Assembly election in Tamil Nadu.
The judges agreed with senior counsel G. Rajagopalan, representing the ECI, that the balance of convenience was actually in favour of the ECI and not in favour of the petitioners which had admittedly not contested any of the elections conducted by the commission in the last six years.
Tamizhaga Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam, Manithaneya Makkal Katchi, Manithaneya Jananayaga Katchi and a few others had filed the writ petitions challenging their de-registration. The petitioners had questioned the authority of the ECI to de-register them in the absence of a statutory power to do so.
Agreeing that the batch of cases argued by senior counsel N.L. Rajah, S. Prabakaran, P. Wilson, R. Srinivas and others had raised “a serious issue of constitutional importance,” the judges directed the High Court Registry to list the main writ petitions for final hearing in the second week of March 2026.
The petitioners had attacked the de-registration orders on the prime ground that Section 29A of the Representation of the People Act of 1951 speaks only about registration of political parties with the ECI but there was no corresponding provision for de-registration of those parties.
Therefore, once the parties get registered, they could not be de-registered by the ECI by invoking Section 21 of the General Clauses Act of 1897, they argued. They relied upon the Supreme Court’s verdict in Indian National Congress versus Institute of Social Welfare (2002) to support their argument.
In that judgement, the Supreme Court had held that parties could be de-registered only in extreme circumstances such as they having obtained registration through fraud or forgery or if they ceased to have faith and allegiance to the Constitution or to the principles of socialism, secularism and so on.
However, the ECI contended that the 2002 judgement was rendered before the commission issued elaborate guidelines, by exercising its powers under Article 324 of the Constitution, in 2014 requiring every other political party to contest elections, conducted by the commission, in a block period of six years.
Mr. Rajagopalan said, after 2014, the ECI had made it mandatory for every new political party to incorporate in its constitution that it shall contest elections within five years of its registrationd and that it would agree for de-registration if it fails to contest the elections within a block period of six years. He said, the guidelines were issued after the Income Tax department had brought to the notice of the ECI that many registered political parties had been receiving public donations and claiming tax benefits without actually contesting any elections and remaining to be political parties just on paper.
The petitioners had also challenged the de-registration orders on the grounds that their members had contested Assembly and Parliamentary elections under the symbols belonging to other parties and that their direct participation in the local body polls had not been taken into consideration by ECI.
However, the ECI claimed that the participation in elections conducted by the commission alone would be taken into consideration and said, though the show cause notices to the petitioners had been issued by the Chief Electoral Officers, the de-registration orders had been passed by the ECI secretary.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the AI Impact Summit on Thursday (February 19, 2026), joined by fellow world leaders and senior tech executives. Mr. Modi’s address will be followed by keynote presentations  by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Google DeepMind CEO Dennis Hassabis, and Reliance Industries Limited, chairman and managing director, Mukesh Ambani. The keynote speakers include Gates Foundation Chair Bill Gates, and Microsoft president Brad Smith.
India AI Summit 2026 Day 3 Highlights
The event has drawn strong crowds, and has been positioned for months as India’s flagship AI event by the government. It follows similar multilateral summits in the U.K., France, and South Korea. President of France Emmanuel Macron will be in attendance, as will Spanish President Pedro Sánchez Pérez-Castejón, and Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
The AI Impact Summit’s expo has been extended by one day, to Saturday (February 21, 2026), so that attendees can visit with more flexible security arrangements after all the multilateral events at the venue wind up, IT Secretary S. Krishnan said in a press conference on Wednesday (February 18, 2026). Students and professionals, who have not been able to attend on the weekdays, would be able to come easily, Mr. Krishnan said.
Over 400 exhibitors, from startups, large corporate firms and government entities to researchers, have their own booths at the summit.
The summit has attracted massive crowds over the first three days, which led to acute inconvenience on Monday (February 16, 2026), when large parts of the venue were closed for public access. Three days in, attendance remains strong, leading to this extension. It is unclear if all exhibitors will be able to stay back through Saturday (February 21, 2026).
The expo will be closed on Thursday (February 19, 2026) in view of the plenary session with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other world leaders. It will reopen on Friday (February 20, 2026).

TITLE: Simultaneous polls panel weighs bar on no-confidence motions in final year of government’s term

The Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) examining the Bill on simultaneous elections is considering a provision that would bar the introduction of a no-confidence motion against an incumbent government if only one year of its term remains, committee chairperson and BJP MP P.P. Chaudhary said on Wednesday (February 18, 2026).
He was speaking at The Hindu Mind, a conversation series featuring leading newsmakers.
The Constitution (129th Amendment) Bill, 2024 enabling simultaneous elections was introduced in the Lok Sabha on December 17, 2024, and immediately referred to the committee. The panel has held 16 meetings in Delhi so far and travelled across the country, with six former Chief Justices of India sharing their views on the legislation.
Explaining key provisions of the Bill, Mr. Chaudhary said that if enacted before the 2029 general elections, the first sitting of the new Lok Sabha would become the “appointed date.” State Assembly terms beginning thereafter would be truncated to align with the 2034 Lok Sabha polls. This one-time synchronisation, he argued, would not violate the federal structure, contrary to the concerns raised by critics.
The pros and cons of simultaneous elections | Explained
Mr. Chaudhary said the panel was deliberating whether to introduce a time bar on moving a no-confidence motion. “We are actively considering introducing a provision that would bar the moving of a no-confidence motion if the incumbent government has only one year left in its term,” he said, noting that several States had similar restrictions for Panchayati Raj institutions.
However, such provisions vary widely across States. Under the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994, for instance, a no-confidence motion cannot be moved in the last year of the term against certain panchayat office-bearers. In contrast, the Karnataka High Court ruled on February 9 that there should be no embargo on moving a no-confidence motion in the final year, emphasising the need to prevent misuse of office during the remaining tenure.
“When grassroots democracy has such a provision, why can’t we adopt it for the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies?” Mr. Chaudhary asked.
While Mr. Chaudhary  maintained that such a restriction was legally plausible, he acknowledged that the final decision must be a political one. “We will also consult the political parties on the issue,” he added.
Mr. Chaudhary conceded that there were infirmities in the current formulation of the Bill, and noted that addressing these gaps was precisely what the panel was attempting to do. For instance, during the deliberations so far, several members had pointed out that the Election Commission had been vested with unfettered powers under the proposed law.
Section 82 A(5) of the new Bill states that “if the Election Commission is of the opinion that the elections to any Legislative Assembly cannot be conducted along with the general election to the House of the People, it may make a recommendation to the President, to declare by an order, that the election to that Legislative Assembly may be conducted at a later date.” Members argued that by not specifying a deadline for the Election Commission, the provision effectively grants the poll panel “arbitrary and unregulated powers.”
This apprehension, Mr. Chaudhary acknowledged, was valid, and the panel was deliberating on how to alter the clause. “Prima facie, I am also of the view that the apprehension is correct and we will have to think about it,” the BJP MP said, adding that it was ultimately for the members to decide on the matter.
The panel, he said, could consider introducing an oversight mechanism. At the same time, he emphasised that the Election Commission was a constitutional body, and there was no reason to distrust its intentions or functioning.

Around 500 people from across the State attended the circle conference of the All India BSNL Pensioners’ Welfare Association (AIBSNLPWA), held in Vijayawada on Wednesday (February 18).
AIBSNLPWA national president D. Gopala Krishnan, general secretary V. Vara Prasad and others spoke on organisational matters, pensioners’ welfare and legal developments.​
Mr. Gopala Krishnan pointed out that following the pension revision implemented in 2007, the next revision has been due since January 1, 2017. ​Referring to the judgment of the Principal Bench, Central Administrative Tribunal, Delhi, September 2023, which directed that pension revision be granted on a par with Central government employees, Mr. Gopala Krishnan said pension revision should be implemented from January 1, 2017, taking the judgment as the guiding benchmark. ​
Mr. Vara Prasad said the issue of pension revision has not been included in the Terms of Reference of the 8th Central Pay Commission (8th CPC). ​He cautioned that the absence of clarity regarding the date of effect may adversely impact pensioners who retired prior to 2026.​
Through the conference, the members urged the government to amend the Terms of Reference to include pension revision for former pensioners and to clearly specify 01-01-2026 as the date of implementation.

Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) senior MLA and former Minister T. Harish Rao slammed the Congress top leadership for the scheduled review of the Telangana government’s two-year performance at the AICC headquarters in New Delhi on Thursday (February 19) calling it ‘a direct affront to Telangana’s pride and the very idea of self-governance’.
Taking strong objection to the meeting scheduled to be chaired by the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi and attended by Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy, his Cabinet colleagues, TPCC president B. Mahesh Kumar Goud and other senior party leaders from the State, he wrote an open letter on Wednesday.
Addressed to the All India Congress Committee (AICC) and tagged to senior leaders Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi and other AICC functionaries, the BRS Legislature Party deputy floor leader said Telangana was formed after a prolonged struggle for self-rule and self-respect, not to function as ‘a remote-controlled State or as a political outpost’ answerable to periodic approvals from Delhi.
Mr. Rao demanded that the Congress leadership first examine its own failure to implement the party’s six-guarantees made during the election campaign in 2023 claiming that 90 % of the guarantees remain unfulfilled even after more than two years.
Alleging that the Congress government had failed to honour key promises made to the farming community, including the ₹2 lakh crop loan waiver, enhanced Rythu Bharosa, crop bonus and crop insurance, he said that partial implementation and exclusions had left farmers disillusioned. He also pointed to unfulfilled commitments.
On social justice, Mr. Harish Rao said the promised enhancement of reservations for SCs and STs and related procurement benefits had not materialised. He further alleged that several welfare schemes launched by the BRS government were being diluted or discontinued.
He also levelled serious allegations of corruption against the State government and warned that Telangana society would not tolerate external control.

Union Minister of State for Steel and Heavy Industries Bhupathiraju Srinivas Varma on Wednesday announced that the works of the bridge proposed across Vasista, a branch of the Godavari river, would begin soon.
The one-kilometre-long bridge connects Narsapuram town in West Godavari district to Sakhinetipalli Lanka in Dr. B. R. Ambedkara Konaseema district. At present, people from these two districts cross the river by punt.
Proposed in 2008, the bhumi puja was performed for the bridge by all the successive Chief Ministers of united Andhra Pradesh. However, the construction of the bridge, which is part of the National Highway-216 project was halted after private landowners moved the court over the land acquisition for the highway road.
Speaking to newsmen at a press conference on Wednesday, Mr. Srinivas Varma said: “All the legal hurdles to speed up the bridge across Vasista branch have been cleared. Once commissioned, the entire region of Konaseema, West Godavari and erstwhile Krishna districts will have better connectivity”.

In a shocking incident, a man allegedly killed his wife and buried her inside their house compound in Devarahipparagi town of Vijayapura district in Karnataka, with the crime coming to light 24 days later.
According to the police, the deceased has been identified as Sarojini Ratnakar (45), while the accused as Prabhu Ratnakar (46).
Prabhu had allegedly taken loans in Sarojini’s name, which often led to disputes between the couple. On the night of January 23, the two were reportedly involved in a heated argument. The following day, January 24, Prabhu allegedly killed Sarojini by hitting her on the head with an iron rod.
Later, he is said to have buried her body within the house premises and fabricated a story claiming that she had left home and not returned. He even lodged a missing complaint at the Devarahipparagi police station and joined her parental family in the search for her.
During the course of the investigation, the police grew suspicious of Prabhu and summoned him for questioning. During sustained interrogation, he reportedly confessed, leading to the revelation of the truth behind the case.
Police later exhumed the body following due legal procedure. After conducting the post-mortem examination, the body was handed over to the family.
Following a complaint lodged by Sarojini’s mother, a case has been registered against Prabhu. Further investigation into the incident is underway.

--------------------
Unruly flyers, beware. India has adopted a “no tolerance" or “zero tolerance" policy with immediate effect for misbehaviour or indiscipline during air travel. The  Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has instructed the airlines to report such passengers.
The aviation regulator said the move is aimed at ensuring the safety of aircraft, people and property, and at maintaining good order and discipline on board.
The DGCA has also issued draft rules on how airlines must handle such passengers on aircraft.
Under the changes proposed by DGCA chief Faiz Ahmed Kidwai, airlines will now be required to put in place procedures to deal with unruly passengers both at the airport and on board the aircraft. The SOP on this will be communicated throughout the organisation and especially to all employees who are in direct contact with passengers, both on the ground and on the aircraft.
The draft also states that the “no-fly rules" will apply to all passengers during the period of air travel to or from India. This means that this rule is not just limited to Indian carriers and airports, the rules will also apply to unruly passengers travelling on foreign airlines on flights to and from India, if those carriers report the matter.
The draft classifies unruly conduct into four categories:
Level 1: Unruly behaviour such as physical gestures, verbal harassment and disruptive drunken conduct.
Level 2: Physically abusive actions including pushing, kicking, hitting, grabbing, inappropriate touching or sexual harassment.
Level 3: Life-threatening behaviour, including damage to aircraft operating systems and serious physical violence such as choking, eye gouging or attempted murder.
Level 4: Attempted or actual breach of the flight crew compartment.

Traffic restrictions will impact several key stretches across central Delhi, including major roads such as Sardar Patel Marg, Janpath, Akbar Road and Teen Murti Marg.
Important diplomatic and high-security routes like Shanti Path, Satya Marg and Africa Avenue will also see regulations.
Additionally, parts of Mathura Road, Subrahmaniam Bharti Marg, Prithvi Raj Road and Dr. Zakir Hussain Marg are expected to face diversions, along with connecting stretches near Lodhi Flyover and Kautilya Marg.
Commuters using these corridors are likely to experience delays and are advised to plan alternate routes accordingly.
To ease congestion during the restrictions, commuters have been advised to use alternate routes including San Martin Marg, Panchsheel Marg, and APJ Abdul Kalam Marg.
Key corridors such as Aurobindo Marg, Lodhi Road, Ring Road, and Barapullah Road are also recommended to help divert traffic from affected stretches.
Other suggested routes include Tilak Marg, Ferozshah Road, Rafi Marg, Sansad Marg, and K Kamraj Marg, along with South Avenue Road and Vandematram Marg.
Motorists are encouraged to plan their journeys in advance and opt for these alternative roads to minimise delays and ensure smoother travel.
“Commuters have been urged to cooperate with authorities and avoid the affected routes wherever possible. They are advised to plan their journeys in advance and factor in additional travel time to account for potential delays," the advisory said.
“Motorists should strictly follow the directions of traffic personnel deployed on duty, adhere to traffic regulations, and maintain proper lane discipline to ensure smooth and safe movement for all road users," it added.
The AI Impact Summit 2026, set to conclude on February 20, is being framed as a key platform aimed at amplifying the voices of developing nations in shaping global AI governance.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hold bilateral and side-line meetings with various heads of state at Bharat Mandapam at 7:00 PM, focusing on discussions and diplomatic engagement.
On the sidelines of the AI Summit in Delhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday will hold a closed-door CEO roundtable with global technology leaders, including Sam Altman and Sundar Pichai, to discuss innovation and cooperation.
PM Modi met Pichai on Wednesday also.
On Thursday, PM Modi will attend the Opening Ceremony of the India AI Impact Summit 2026 at around 9:40 a.m. The event will also be addressed by the President of France, the UN Secretary-General and top industry leaders from across the world.
At 11 a.m., the Prime Minister will visit the India AI Impact Expo 2026 and tour various country pavilions with other leaders.
He will then join the Leaders’ Plenary at noon to discuss AI governance, infrastructure and international cooperation.
From 5:30 p.m., he will take part in a CEO roundtable on investment, research collaboration, supply chains and AI deployment.
After the India AI Impact Summit, Delhi is likely to push for a more democratised use of artificial intelligence. The focus will be on affordability and wider access to the technology. Government officials say this approach is aimed at countering the trend in the West, where AI development is concentrated in the hands of a few companies and individuals.
A senior government official told The Indian Express that the move is in line with India’s G20 narrative. The official said Delhi wants to assert its position in the Global South and show that it speaks in the interest of the region.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi will participate in the opening ceremony of the India AI Impact Summit 2026 on Thursday morning.

--------------------
In a historic display of India’s technological and diplomatic prowess, the capital prepares for the crowning moment of the India AI Impact Summit 2026. Following a week of high-level deliberations and the vibrant AI Impact Expo, the formal inauguration by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday at Bharat Mandapam is set to be a global spectacle, cementing New Delhi’s role as the “capital of the Global South" in the artificial intelligence era.
The morning will begin with a powerful visual of global unity at the iconic Bharat Mandapam.
09:15 AM: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will personally welcome heads of state and world leaders, followed by a Family Photo—a symbolic image representing the unified global front on AI governance.
09:40 AM: The Opening Ceremony of the India AI Impact Summit 2026 will commence, featuring addresses from high-profile leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron and UN Secretary-General António Guterres.
10:25 AM: Prime Minister Modi will deliver his keynote address, setting the definitive roadmap for “Sovereign AI" and inclusive technology.
The atmosphere at Bharat Mandapam has been nothing short of electric. Transformed into a futuristic hub, the venue has hosted over 2.5 lakh visitors and delegates from more than 60 nations. The architectural brilliance of the convention centre, illuminated with AI-themed light installations, provides a fitting backdrop for what is being called the “G20 moment" of the tech world.
The scale of the event is a testament to India’s burgeoning influence. With over 20 heads of state and 500 global AI leaders—including CEOs from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Microsoft—the summit has transcended being a mere tech conference. It is a declaration of India’s intent to bridge the digital divide. The theme, “Sarvajana Hitaya, Sarvajana Sukhaya" (Welfare for all, happiness of all), resonates through the halls, where the focus remains on using AI for social empowerment, agriculture, and sustainable development.
World leaders have been effusive in their praise for India’s distinctive approach to technology. UN Secretary-General António Guterres lauded India as a “very successful emerging economy" and the “perfect host," emphasising that the world needs India to ensure AI doesn’t become a privilege of the few. President Alar Karis of Estonia, a global digital pioneer himself, remarked that India’s Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) is now the global benchmark for how modern states should operate.
The summit has successfully showcased that India is not just a consumer of AI but a primary innovator. From the launch of 12 indigenous foundation models tailored for Indian languages to the democratisation of high-end computing resources, the “India Way" is being viewed as the blueprint for the Global South. As leaders gather for the family photo tomorrow morning, they aren’t just standing with a tech hub; they are standing with a nation that has successfully married ancient wisdom with frontier technology.

--------------------
Speaking at the AI Impact Summit, US House Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence Policy Advisor Srinivas Krishna on Saturday said India can leverage American innovation to build artificial intelligence tools that directly benefit its citizens.
Speaking at a special session on the sidelines of the AI-India Impact Summit in New Delhi, Krishna described India as a “vibrant" democracy and highlighted the shared strengths of the two countries in technology and research.
“All the leading model companies are based in the US. It’s like you’ve built billions of dollars between this year and next year, that just keeps vertical on the GPUs, on advanced AI chips, Nvidia and TPUs are really the only game in town for everyone," Krishna said. He added that while the US has advanced AI infrastructure, India can emerge as a key partner in applying AI for public good.

“I think the question is, how do you bring AI to make everyone the quality of life as citizens? And, for example, the way we are trying to do it, I just give you one example in education," he said.
Krishna noted that AI applications can extend beyond sectors like healthcare and be embedded in broader civic systems. “When people talk about what a country like India should do, I think about how do you use AI leverage, all of this investment leverage, all of the innovation happening in America, which we think is the best in class, and then build, you know, the services, the tools, which you utilize for your citizens," he added.
Referring to India’s AI Action Plan, Krishna outlined three focus areas: accelerating innovation, building AI infrastructure, and leading internationally in AI governance and policy.
He also emphasised the need for open scientific collaboration between the two countries. “We want to make sure we unlock the Cernis of the world, the open ways of the world, the blocks of the world, the anthropics of the world," he said, underlining the importance of shared research and discovery.
Krishna pointed to the TRUST (Transforming the Relationship Utilizing Strategic Technologies) initiative as a framework to deepen US-India collaboration in areas such as artificial intelligence, semiconductors, quantum computing, biotechnology and space.
As part of future cooperation, he said both countries are working on a roadmap under the US-India initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET), focusing on joint development in AI, semiconductor supply chains, defence technologies and advanced materials.
“So a lot of scientific discovery is going to change, and we are only getting started. So I think it’s time of great excitement, and I think all of us should feel lucky that we’re living through this," Krishna said.

--------------------
Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić, in an exclusive conversation with CNN-News18’s Rahul Shivshankar, praised PM Narendra Modi for turning India into a decisive global voice.
Hailing India’s foreign policy, he said, “…At the end, all doors, gates are opened…That is serious statecraft."
Listing the ways in which PM Modi turned India into a decisive global voice, Serbian President Vučić said, “He is a very charismatic and hardworking leader. He is well-known across the world. India became visible in the world because of him. He is overwhelmingly present and dominant."
Hailing the foreign policy of India, the Serbian President said, “When you speak to PM Modi, you speak to him and the India state, without being influenced by other powers."
According to Vučić, the third major reason is PM Modi’s contribution to India’s progress. “Not only in overall economy, but specific areas such as IT sector, digitised economy and AI."
Vučić said he first met Modi in Ahmedabad in Gujarat for a special conference in 2017. “What I saw not only in Modi’s behaviour, but his eyes was that he was committed to his country. He takes care of everything. He is committed to details. He is a control freak in a positive sense because he cares," the Serbian President said.

“Strategic autonomy gives you respect," he said.
Recounting the economic pressure, political isolation and attempts to weaken Serbia, the President said, “In the end, Narendra Modi opened all gates. We are not isolated. It was not the case 2-3 years ago…"
“There are tonnes of players in the world who want a weaker contender from India…Of course. There will always be attempts to weaken strong competitors. Why would others prefer a strong India? They would rather face a weaker one," he said.
That is why PM Modi is dedicated towards strengthening the military of India, political position of India in world and working on economic progress…He signed a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the European Union (EU), with the United States (US), at the same time, he did not spoil his relation with Russia, while being cautious with China. Always keeping calm and stable is great politics…"

--------------------
In a daylight attack in Punjab’s Tarn Taran district, an Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) sarpanch was shot dead during a wedding function on Wednesday, sparking fresh outrage over the state’s law and order situation.
According to police and eyewitness accounts, two unidentified motorcycle-borne gunmen suddenly entered the marriage palace where the sarpanch, Harbrinder Singh alias Happy, was attending a ceremony with relatives. Without warning, they opened indiscriminate fire on him from close range, killing him on the spot and critically injuring his cousin, who was rushed to a nearby hospital.
Senior officers reached the scene soon after the incident, cordoned off the area and launched a manhunt for the attackers. Forensic teams are scanning CCTV footage from the venue and surrounding areas as part of the investigation. Police have stated that the motive remains unclear, although preliminary investigations are underway.
The brazen shooting comes amid heightened tensions in the state. It follows several high-profile attacks on politicians in recent weeks, prompting criticism from opposition leaders who have blamed the ruling AAP government for a deteriorating security climate.
BJP leader Jaiveer Shergill condemned the incident on social media, saying, “Another day, another broad daylight murder in Punjab. AAP sarpanch shot dead in a wedding function in Tarn Taran, Punjab! Punjab is witnessing a non-stop naked dance of lawlessness & death!" He demanded action, adding that “Punjab needs to be saved from criminals & AAP!"

Additonally,
Punjab Congress and the Leader of Opposition, Partap Singh Bajwa also reacted sharply to the incident, calling it a “cold-blooded murder" that exposes what he described as a collapse of law and order in the state. In a post on X, Bajwa alleged that under Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann and the AAP government, gangsters are roaming freely while the administration remains focused on public relations. He claimed that border districts are increasingly turning into crime zones and said Punjab is paying a heavy price for what he termed the government’s “bloody badlaav" (change).

LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/exhibitors-must-not-display-items-centre-amid-galgotias-chinese-robodog-display-at-ai-summit-9914448.html
--------------------
The Centre issued a stern warning to all exhibitors after the Galgotias University sparked a major controversy at the high-profile India AI Impact Summit 2026 in New Delhi by allegedly presenting a Chinese robodog as its own.
Following the controversy, IT Secretary S Krishnan said the government does not want any exhibitor to showcase items that are not their own. “We do not want such exhibits to continue," he said, after organisers asked Galgotias University to vacate its stall.
This came after the Greater Noida-based Galgotias University faced intense criticism after reports suggested that the Unitree Go2 robotic dog was displayed under the name “Orion," prompting allegations that imported technology was being presented as indigenously developed.
A clip went viral showing Galgotias’ Professor Neha Singh introducing the Robodog as ‘Orion’ and saying it was developed by the Centre of Excellence of the institution. Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi said the incident brought significant damage to the country and the AI Summit.
Congress leader and Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi described the event as a “disorganised PR spectacle" where Indian data is being showcased alongside Chinese products.
Krishnan said the government would not tolerate exhibits misrepresented as original creations. “We want genuine and actual work to be reflected in the way that people exhibit in expos. The idea is not to sort of use this as an opportunity in any other fashion. We don’t want the controversy surrounding the exhibits presented here. So I think it’s essential that a code is followed there. Misinformation cannot be encouraged," he added.
Abhishek Singh, Additional Secretary in Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, said the intention is not to stifle innovation but it should not be misleading. The controversy “should not overshadow the kind of effort that the others have put in," he said.
Galgotias Asked To Vacate AI Summit
Later, authorities asked the Galgotias University to vacate the AI Impact Summit Expo following the allegations. The staff and students of Galgotias University vacated their stall, and power was reportedly cut off at the Galgotias University pavilion after the institution was asked to leave the venue.
Government sources said the Centre has taken the matter seriously and that a clear message has been conveyed to all exhibitors regarding compliance and transparency at the summit.
However, the university defended itself by saying that it had never claimed to have built the device. “Galgotias has not built this robodog, nor have we claimed to do so," it said in a statement.
“We at Galgotias, faculty and students, are deeply pained by the propaganda campaign against our university. We would like to clearly state that the robotic programming is part of our endeavour to make students learn AI programming and develop & deploy real world skills using globally available tools and resources, given developing AI talent is need of an hour," the university in another statement.
The India AI Impact Summit, billed as a flagship event in the Global South, is underway in Delhi and is expected to host at least 20 heads of state and governments, including French President Emmanuel Macron and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the event on Thursday.

TITLE: Ram Temple Fuels Ayodhya’s Economic Surge: Study Projects Rs 4 Lakh Crore Tourism Revenue
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/ram-temple-fuels-ayodhyas-economic-surge-study-projects-rs-4-lakh-crore-tourism-revenue-9913403.html
--------------------
The construction and consecration of the Ram Janmabhoomi Temple in January 2024 has significantly reshaped Ayodhya’s economic landscape, leading a surge in tourism, investment and job creation, according to a new study by Indian Institute of Management Lucknow (IIM Lucknow).
The report, titled “Economic Renaissance of Ayodhya," examined the transformation of the temple town following the consecration of the grand temple. The report also described how faith-led infrastructure has become a durable growth driver, helping Ayodhya pivot from a low-capacity pilgrimage town to a high-footfall tourism hub.
The study has been authored by Venkataramanaiah Saddikuti of IIM Lucknow, KV Raju, Professor Emeritus at Chanakya University and economic advisor to the Uttar Pradesh government, and Gopika Varma of Indian Institute of Management Rohtak.
According to the study, more than 11 crore (110 million) devotees visited Ayodhya within the first six months after the consecration. Annual footfall is now projected at 5–6 crore, placing the city among India’s leading religious tourism destinations.
Before the temple’s construction, Ayodhya’s economy revolved around small-scale pilgrimage activity. Annual visitor numbers were modest, hospitality capacity was limited, national hotel chains had negligible presence, and the absence of an airport constrained connectivity. Employment opportunities were limited, leading to youth migration.
Post-consecration, redevelopment and capacity expansion projects worth approximately Rs 85,000 crore are underway, spanning roads, railways, urban renewal and airport expansion. These investments have helped crowd in private capital and expand the services sector.
Tourism-led economic activity is projected to generate Rs 20,000–25,000 crore in tax revenues over the medium term. The study estimated that tourism spending in Uttar Pradesh could cross Rs 4 lakh crore, with Ayodhya contributing a significant share.
“The scale of the economic turnaround surprised us. When we began the study, we did not anticipate such a sharp enrichment of the region. The temple has acted as a catalyst, and infrastructure has converted footfall into sustained economic activity," professor Saddikuti told Moneycontrol. “This is not a one-off spike. We are seeing repeat visitation, longer stays and higher spend per visitor, which is what makes the model durable," he added.
It is noteworthy that after assuming office in 2017, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath accelerated the temple economy framework, coupling temple development with modern infrastructure expansion in Ayodhya, thereby opening pathways for broader economic prosperity.
The report further highlighted rapid employment growth across hospitality, construction, transport and services. Around 6,000 micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) have been newly set up or revived in and around Ayodhya. Over the next four to five years, tourism expansion is expected to generate approximately 1.2 lakh direct and indirect jobs.
Small retailers and street vendors report daily earnings rising from Rs 400–500 earlier to as much as Rs 2,500. Real estate prices near the temple precinct have risen five to ten times, attracting investors from across India.
Between February 2020 and February 2025, the Ram Temple Trust remitted around Rs 400 crore in taxes, including approximately Rs 270 crore in GST, indicating growing formalisation and compliance, the authors noted.
Daily footfall of over two lakh pilgrims has sustained demand for hospitality and allied services. More than 150 new hotels and homestays have opened in the city. Major hotel chains, including Taj Hotels, Marriott International and Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, have announced expansion plans in Ayodhya.
Online travel platforms have reported up to fourfold growth in bookings. Tour operators said that pilgrims are increasingly combining visits to Ayodhya with trips to Varanasi, indicating the emergence of a broader spiritual tourism circuit.
Professor Saddikuti said that the Ram temple is shaping India’s emerging “temple economy" playbook, comparable to redevelopment-led tourism growth seen around Kashi Vishwanath Temple and Mahakaleshwar Temple.
“If connectivity, crowd management and last-mile services keep pace, Ayodhya can anchor a multi-city spiritual tourism circuit with measurable economic spillovers," he said.
Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the leadership of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, the temple-led development framework has gained academic validation, the report noted.

Earlier, top government sources told CNN-News18 that authorities became aware of Galgotias University’s claims regarding the Chinese-made robotic dog and took immediate action by asking it to vacate the venue. Sources added that the government has taken the matter seriously and that a clear message has been conveyed to all exhibitors regarding compliance and transparency at the summit.
What’s The Matter?
Galgotias University faced intense criticism after reports suggested that the Unitree Go2 robotic dog was displayed under the name “Orion," prompting allegations that imported technology was being presented as indigenously developed. A clip went viral showing Galgotias’ Professor Neha Singh introducing the Robodog as ‘Orion’ and saying it was developed by the Centre of Excellence of the institution.
Political leaders also slammed the university for causing “national embarrassment" and shame by displaying Chinese-made AI robots at a high-profile tech summit hosted by India. Facing intense backlash, the university issued an official clarification, saying it had never claimed to have built the device. “Galgotias has not built this robodog, nor have we claimed to do so," it said.
Galgotias University also came under scrutiny over a ‘soccer drone‘ it claimed to have built from scratch. However, several social media users identified it as the Striker V3 ARF, a soccer drone developed by South Korea’s Helsel Group for drone sports. The model is reportedly available for purchase in India for around Rs 40,000.

TITLE: Green Light For Rs 80,000-Crore Great Nicobar Mega Project: NGT’s ‘Balanced Approach’ Explained
LINK: https://www.news18.com/explainers/nod-for-rs-80000-crore-great-nicobar-mega-infra-project-ngts-balanced-approach-explained-ws-kl-9913347.html
--------------------
The National Green Tribunal (NGT) recently cleared the Rs 80,000-crore Great Nicobar Island mega infrastructure project, stating there were “adequate safeguards" in place.
The tribunal’s special six-member bench, headed by Chairperson Justice Prakash Shrivastava, refused to interfere with the environmental clearance (EC) originally granted in November 2022, citing the project’s strategic national importance.
The NGT’s decision followed a report from a High-Powered Committee (HPC), which was formed in 2023 to address earlier deficiencies in the clearance process.
The project, spearheaded by the Andaman and Nicobar Islands Integrated Development Corporation (ANIIDCO), includes an International Container Transshipment Terminal (ICTT), a greenfield international airport, a power plant, and a township.
The Great Nicobar Island (GNI) project, officially known as the ‘Holistic Development of Great Nicobar Island’, aims to transform India’s southernmost island into a major global maritime and strategic hub.
The project spans 166 sq km (about 10% of the island) and includes four primary pillars:
International Container Transshipment Terminal (ICTT): Located at Galathea Bay, this deep-sea port is the centerpiece. It aims to capture global trade passing through the Malacca Strait, reducing India’s reliance on foreign ports like Colombo and Singapore.
Greenfield International Airport: A dual-use facility for both civilian tourism and military logistics, capable of handling wide-body aircraft.
Integrated Township: Designed to support a future population of over 3.5 lakh people, up from the current 8,000.
Gas & Solar Power Plant: A 450-MVA hybrid plant to provide energy self-sufficiency for the new infrastructure.
The island is just 40 nautical miles from one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, Malacca Strait, where 40% of global trade passes. It serves as India’s “first line of defence," providing a forward base to monitor naval movements in the Indo-Pacific, particularly countering regional influence from other powers. Currently, 75% of India’s transshipment cargo is handled outside the country. This project aims to bring that revenue and logistical control back to India.
The project is being implemented in phases, with the first phase of the port targeted for completion by 2028.
The tribunal on February 16 emphasised a “balanced approach," ruling that the project’s significance for national security and trade near the Malacca Strait outweighed the grounds for halting it.
Relying on Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) findings, the NGT noted no major reefs are in the direct project footprint but mandated the translocation of approximately 16,000 coral colonies found nearby. Directives were issued to ensure no loss of sandy beaches, which are critical nesting grounds for the Leatherback sea turtle and the Nicobar megapode.
The tribunal concluded that the project does not fall within prohibited Island Coastal Regulation Zone (ICRZ-IA) areas, dismissing petitioners’ claims of regulatory violations.
The NGT noted that the government must adhere to welfare conditions for the Shompen (a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group) and Nicobarese communities, though local leaders have alleged coercion in land surrender.

TITLE: Mamata Banerjee Fact-Checked: What Bangladesh Election Data Shows On Minority Representation | Exclusive
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/mamata-banerjee-fact-checked-what-bangladesh-election-data-shows-on-minority-representation-exclusive-ws-kl-9913122.html
--------------------
Indian intelligence sources have rejected West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s recent remarks citing Bangladesh’s elections in her criticism of the Election Commission of India, saying she does not have complete data about how the neighbouring country’s polls were conducted.
Addressing the media after polls in the neighbouring country, Banerjee had said: “The election in Bangladesh was concluded peacefully. Everybody thought there will be violence. But it was done peacefully. But while India is a democratic county, its Election Commission with its ‘threat culture’, will bulldoze democracy."
However, sources familiar with internal assessments told CNN-News18 that the picture emerging from Bangladesh’s parliamentary elections is far more complex, and troubling, particularly with regard to minority participation and representation.
‘Deliberate Playbook’
Intelligence inputs indicate that violence and intimidation targeting Hindus and other minorities continued for over a year, particularly in politically sensitive and border districts. Officials describe what they term a “deliberate playbook" by certain political actors aimed at inciting anti-minority sentiment, including attacks and pressure tactics designed to discourage participation.
In several constituencies, especially in volatile regions such as Bagerhat and Gopalganj, rejections and withdrawals of minority candidates were reportedly higher, pointing to security concerns. Sources allege that in some pockets, minorities were “systematically pushed out of the system" through a mix of administrative hurdles and intimidation.
Representation Gap In Candidate Numbers
Data from the Bangladesh parliamentary election shows that of 2,034 candidates contesting 299 seats, only 80 were from Hindu minority backgrounds. That represents approximately 3.9 per cent of the total candidate pool, even though Hindus comprise about 8 per cent of Bangladesh’s population—effectively half their demographic share.
In several constituencies where Hindu voters account for 15-20 per cent of the electorate, major political parties reportedly did not nominate Hindu candidates.
Many Hindu aspirants are said to have filed nominations in significant numbers, including in minority-heavy constituencies such as Khulna-1, where eight Hindu nominees initially entered the race. However, some nomination papers were rejected on multiple grounds, while others were allegedly withdrawn under pressure.
Most of the 80 Hindu candidates were fielded by smaller leftist parties with limited vote share. Only two to three Hindu candidates are believed to have won seats, all on tickets from the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). No major mainstream party is seen to have significantly exceeded proportional representation for Hindu candidates.
War Of Words
Banerjee’s comments, suggesting that India should look at how Bangladesh conducted its polls, sparked immediate backlash from the BJP and drew a firm response from the Election Commission, which defended the country’s electoral processes.
Intelligence sources now argue that selective comparisons overlook ground realities in Bangladesh, including minority underrepresentation and reported intimidation.

TITLE: Too Noisy? Mumbai’s Melody Road Sparks Backlash Days After Launch
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/too-noisy-mumbais-melody-road-sparks-backlash-days-after-launch-9912240.html
--------------------
Mumbai’s newly opened melody road on the Coastal Road is facing backlash just two days after its inauguration. Residents of Breach Candy have written to Municipal Commissioner Bhushan Gagrani, calling the constant musical vibrations a major disturbance. A copy of the complaint has also been sent to the Maharashtra Chief Minister’s Office.
The local residents’ forum, representing over 650 families, said the tune plays daily from 6am to midnight, adding to the existing traffic noise. They have demanded that the BMC discontinue the musical stretch. The civic body is yet to respond.
The musical stretch is designed to play the tune ‘Jai Ho’ when vehicles strike precision rumble strips at the correct speed. It was meant to reward safe driving. However, residents in nearby densely populated neighbourhoods say it has become a constant disturbance.
In their letter, the Breach Candy ALM and the Breach Candy Residents Forum said the amplified sound enters homes as a constant, muffled but intrusive background noise. Many residents are keeping windows shut. Senior citizens have reportedly expressed serious discomfort.
Residents said the northbound side of the road is meant for fast-moving traffic. They argue that drivers are getting distracted by listening to the music instead of focusing on the road. Some drivers are slowing down suddenly to hear the tune, which could lead to high-speed crashes or pile-ups.
The community said Mumbai already faces constant horn-honking and engine noise. They believe adding amplified music is unnecessary and worsens the noise problem.
They also pointed out that the music plays near schools and hospitals, where peace and quiet are important for health and learning. The letter said residents are increasingly fatigued from raising serious civic concerns while avoidable and non-essential interventions receive attention. It added that the deafening noise from speeding supercars on the Coastal Road remains unaddressed.
Residents have urged the civic administration to immediately review and discontinue the music initiative, calling it disruptive to daily life in the neighbourhood.

TITLE: 'Rumours Have Now Come True': Gaurav Gogoi Alleges Bhupen Borah Leaked Congress's Internal Info
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/gaurav-gogoi-slams-bhupen-borah-congress-resignation-joining-bjp-former-assam-congress-chief-ws-l-9912086.html
--------------------
Assam Congress president Gaurav Gogoi on Wednesday launched a sharp attack on former state Congress chief Bhupen Borah, questioning his decision to move towards the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) soon after resigning from the party and alleging that recent developments have validated long-standing suspicions within the Congress about internal information leaks.
Reacting to Borah’s statements and his impending entry into the BJP, Gogoi said Congress leaders had earlier been troubled by how confidential discussions within the party were allegedly reaching individuals close to Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma.
“We always wondered how confidential details of our meetings were leaked to a particular journalist linked to Himanta Biswa Sarma. We tried our best not to believe in these rumours and speculation, but now these rumours have come to light, and it is true," Gogoi said.
He further accused Borah of quickly aligning with the BJP leadership after stepping down from the Congress, saying the timing of the move has raised serious political questions.
“A day after leaving the Congress party, Bhupen Borah has no qualms about joining the BJP and surrendering to Himanta Biswa Sarma. Why, within a day of resignation, did you join Himanta Biswa Sarma?" Gogoi asked.
Gogoi also dismissed Borah’s criticism of the Congress as a justification for switching sides.
“All of this is just an excuse to join the BJP. When someone joins the BJP, they are given a script, and they have to read that script," he said.
Gogoi added that people across Assam were questioning Borah’s decision to join the BJP instead of another opposition party if he was dissatisfied within the Congress.
“The people of Assam are thinking that if you are facing difficulties in the Congress party, then why don’t you join some other party that is fighting against the BJP? There are other parties too that are fighting against the BJP. Why did you shake hands with Himanta Biswa Sarma within just one day of resigning?" he said.
The political row comes after Borah resigned from Congress earlier this week, triggering a major churn in Assam politics.
Borah claimed that the state Congress unit is no longer functioning under Gogoi’s effective leadership and alleged that Dhubri MP Rakibul Hussain has become the party’s “sole base", while describing Gogoi as merely the “face of the party".
Borah also said that the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, spoke to him at length after he submitted his resignation letter, recalling their long political association.
Senior Congress leaders, including the party’s central leadership, had reached out to persuade him to reconsider his decision, though Borah maintained that he needed time to reflect after more than three decades in the party.
Meanwhile, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma announced that Borah would formally join the BJP on February 22 after meeting him at his residence, publicly welcoming the former Congress leader and stating that the BJP’s doors remain open to him.

--------------------
The government has extended the India AI Impact Summit 2026 Expo by an additional day, allowing the exhibition to remain open to the public on Saturday, February 21, in view of the large public turnout and to ensure a smoother and more comfortable experience for visitors.
According to an official announcement, the Expo timings have already been extended till 8 pm, reflecting the growing enthusiasm among delegates and the general public attending the event at Bharat Mandapam.
However, the Expo will remain closed to the public on Thursday, February 19, due to access-restricted events and heightened security arrangements at the venue.
As per PTI reports, delegates attending the conference will face restricted access on Wednesday and Thursday owing to VIP movements and security protocols.
Participants would be required to vacate the convention area by 4:30 pm as the Prime Minister is scheduled to host a dinner for state guests and business leaders later in the evening.
Digital India Managing Director and CEO Akhil Kumar told reporters that the Expo area has drawn significant interest, prompting organisers to extend operating hours.
“Delegates can move to the expo area after vacating the convention area. Exit will be only through Gate 4 throughout the day," Kumar said, adding that entry arrangements have been streamlined with Gate 4 designated for vehicle drop-offs and Gate 10 operational for Metro arrivals between 8 am and 4:30 pm.
Officials also cautioned that intermittent traffic restrictions may be experienced between 4 pm and 11 pm in and around the ITPO area during summit days due to security arrangements.
The Expo extension comes amid a major achievement for the IndiaAI Impact Summit 2026, which has entered the Guinness World Records for recording the highest number of student pledges for the responsible use of artificial intelligence within 24 hours.
Guinness World Records adjudicator Pravin Patel announced that a total of 2,50,946 pledges were received during the summit, significantly surpassing the target of 5,000.
Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw credited the initiative to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision, saying outreach efforts to schools and colleges played a crucial role.
“It was the vision of Honourable Prime Minister Narendra Modi because of which we reached out to schools and colleges for the pledge for responsible use of AI," Vaishnaw said.
The Prime Minister is scheduled to inaugurate the main summit on February 19, with restricted entry expected during the morning inaugural session.
Officials said the Expo area would open for all delegates from 11 am onward that day, including access to the media centre in Hall 1.

--------------------
A man walking along the roadside in Perampalli village in Karnataka’s Udupi was run over by a crane in broad daylight. The accident took place in front of the Herga Agricultural Service Cooperative Society. The pedestrian sustained serious injuries and was rushed to a nearby private hospital for treatment.
According to preliminary reports, the crane driver allegedly swerved the vehicle to avoid an oncoming car and, in the process, ran over the man walking alone along the roadside. The horrific incident was captured on CCTV.
In the video, the man can be seen coming under the vehicles of the crane. The footage shows the driver halting his vehicle for a brief moment after the man was run over but he soon resumed his journey without checking on the man. A few moments later, the pedestrian managed to regain his senses, visibly struggling to get up. It is to be noted that the vehicle was moving in a moderate speed when the accident occurred.
The driver reportedly fled the scene immediately after the accident. So far, no arrests have been made as
authorities continue to examine the footage to trace the driver.
Crane Crushes Man To Death In Rajasthan
Earlier in January, an elderly farmer, Kailash Gurjar (56), was crushed to death by a speeding crane on the service road of the Jaipur-Agra National Highway in Dausa, Rajasthan. According to police, Gurjar was walking home from Manpur Chauraha Market when the crane hit him from behind, and its wheels ran over his body. He was declared dead on the spot. The driver fled, and authorities launched a search based on a complaint filed by Gurjar’s son.
Residents in both areas have raised concerns over the reckless operation of cranes and other heavy vehicles. Along busy service roads and near industrial units, large vehicles frequently move at high speeds, posing serious risks to pedestrians. Locals have demanded stricter enforcement of traffic rules and accountability for drivers of such heavy machinery to prevent any untoward incident in the future.

--------------------
Big technology events are often seen as a stage to show what the future looks like. Universities, startups and companies bring their latest ideas in a hope to impress experts and policymakers.  That is what happened at the India AI Impact Summit 2026 in Delhi where Galgotias University found itself in the middle of a debate.
Government sources said on Wednesday, February 18, that the university had been asked to vacate the expo venue immediately. The move came after questions were raised about a robotic dog displayed at the summit.
What Sparked Galgotias University’s Robotic Dog Controversy?
The issue began when a robotic dog named “ORION" was presented at the summit. A video showed a faculty member demonstrating the robot which caught widespread attention online. Soon after, social media users claimed that the device looked exactly like the Unitree Go2, a commercially available robotic dog made by a Chinese company.
This led to accusations that the university was presenting an imported product as its own innovation. The controversy grew because the display was linked to the university’s larger Rs 350 crore AI ecosystem investment.
How Did The University Respond?
As the debate picked up pace online, the university issued a clarification. It said that it had never “claimed" to have built the robotic dog. According to the statement, the device was purchased from China-based Unitree for academic purposes and student learning.
“The recently acquired robodog from Unitree is one such step in that journey. It is not merely a machine on display; it is a classroom in motion. Our students are experimenting with it, testing its limits and, in the process, expanding their own knowledge. Let us be clear: Galgotias has not built this robodog, nor have we ever claimed to. Let us be clear – Galgotias has not built this robodog, neither have we claimed. But what we are building are minds that will soon design, engineer, and manufacture such technologies right here in Bharat," the statement read which was shared by the university’s official X (formerly Twitter) handle.

What Were The Broader Criticisms?
The controversy did not remain limited to just the robot. Critics began questioning how projects are selected for display at national-level technology events. Concerns about whether imported, off-the-shelf products should be showed at such summits were also raised.
The debate also extended to government-backed innovation funding and patent support.
What Is Galgotias University’s AI Ecosystem Investment?
At the centre of the discussion is the university’s announcement of investing over Rs 350 crore in building an AI ecosystem. This has been described as the largest investment of its kind by a private university in India.
The investment was made with an aim to create strong infrastructure for AI education, research and real-world applications.
What Are The Core Infrastructure And Key Components Of University’s AI Push?
A high-end computing setup powered by NVIDIA’s DGX H200 supercomputing platform is the major part of its AI push. It is designed to handle large-scale AI model training across areas like data science, machine learning and computer vision.
The campus also houses Centres of Excellence focused on applied research, patents and startup support. Students and researchers are given access to high-performance computing tools for interdisciplinary projects. The curriculum is reportedly aligned with industry needs and supported by enterprise-level technology.
What About The Strategic Goals?
Dhruv Galgotia, CEO of Galgotias University, has stated that the long-term goal is to help position India as a global leader in AI. He said that the emphasisis is on building real national capability in advanced technologies.
What Is Galgotias University Famous For?

What Are The Best Courses Offered?
The university’s strongest programs are in technology. B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering especially with AI and machine learning specialisations, remains one of the most sought-after courses.
Apart from engineering, it also offers MBA and core engineering branches like Mechanical and Civil.
What Are Galgotias University’s AI Contributions?
Beyond the current controversy, the university positions itself as a major private investor in AI education in India. The Rs 350 crore ecosystem includes advanced labs in areas such as semiconductors and drone intelligence.
Students and startups associated with the university were also showcased at the AI Impact Summit 2026. Despite the debate around the robotic dog, the institution continues to project itself as a serious player in India’s growing AI landscape.

They also alleged that sections of the opposition were attempting to politicise the issue, claiming they were unsettled by the success of the first-ever AI Summit in India.
The institution had faced criticism after reports suggested that the Unitree Go2 robotic dog was displayed under the name “Orion," prompting allegations that imported technology was being presented as indigenously developed.
In its earlier statement, the university had said, “Let us be clear, Galgotias has not built this robodog, nor have we claimed to do so. What we are building are minds that will soon design, engineer and manufacture such technologies in Bharat." It also maintained that the device was acquired for academic purposes and used as a learning tool for students.
The controversy triggered a social media backlash, with several users accusing the institution of misrepresenting the origin of the AI-powered robotic dog. Responding to the criticism, Galgotias University had said it routinely brings global technologies to campus to expose students to cutting-edge innovation and that its focus remains on fostering indigenous capabilities in the long run.
Government sources, however, indicated that following the episode, the university has now been directed to vacate the AI Summit expo space. The AI Impact Summit, which brings together policymakers, industry leaders and innovators, continues at Bharat Mandapam under heightened scrutiny.

--------------------
Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Jayanti is observed every year on February 19 to mark the birth anniversary of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. He was the founder of the Maratha Empire and is remembered as one of India’s most respected rulers. Known for his courage and strong leadership, he fought several battles and built a powerful kingdom.
He was crowned as the “Chhatrapati (Emperor)" in 1674. His ideas, leadership style, and words still inspire people across the country. In Maharashtra, the day is celebrated with pride, and many events are organised to honour his legacy.
February 19 is a public holiday in Maharashtra. In Mumbai, several services and offices remain closed for the day, while some essential services continue to function. Residents and visitors should plan their schedules accordingly.
Public transport in Mumbai, including buses, local trains, and taxis, will operate normally. Commuters can travel without worrying about service disruptions. Metro services are also expected to run as per their regular schedule.

--------------------
Hours after Delhi Police registered an FIR in connection with the alleged theft of AI wearable devices during the ongoing India AI Impact Summit, the Bengaluru-based AI startup founder confirmed that the devices have been recovered — nearly 24 hours after he first flagged the incident.
The start-up founder on Tuesday alleged that the company’s wearable devices were stolen from inside a “high-security zone" at the India AI Impact Summit, being held at Bharat Mandapam in the national capital.
Two individuals have been identified who were present at the AI Summit to work. They are investigating whether this is a case of theft or if the wearables were mistakenly taken away, India Today reported, citing police sources.
Giving an update on the theft incident, Dhananjay Yadav, founder of NeoSapien, took to social media and informed that the devices were traced swiftly following police action.
“Just wanted to update everyone, our devices have been recovered. Huge thanks to Delhi Police for the superfast response and support. Truly grateful for all the messages, help, and encouragement we’ve received over the last two days, it means a lot to me," he wrote in a post on X.

In a shocking incident, the founder of NeoSapien on Tuesday claimed that a theft occurred during the India AI Impact Summit after exhibitors were asked to vacate their stalls ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit.
“Day 1 of the AI Impact Summit turned to be a pain for us," Dhananjay Yadav wrote on X. “I came genuinely excited… it was the first time the summit was being hosted in India, and I wanted to show up personally to support the ecosystem and the government’s push."
He said that at around 12 noon, security personnel arrived to sanitise and cordon off the area ahead of the Prime Minister’s scheduled visit at 2 pm. “I explained that we’re building India’s first patented AI wearable at NeoSapien and requested a chance to showcase it," he said.
Yadav further highlighted “lack of co-ordination between the security" and said that while one officer allegedly allowed him to stay, another group later ordered him and his team to leave immediately.
“I asked: ‘Should we take our wearables?’ They said, others are leaving even laptops behind, security will take care. Trusting them, I left. Hoping that the wearables will be safe, and if I am lucky, it might catch the eye of PM Modi," he wrote, adding that the gates were closed from 12 pm to 6 pm — “much, much longer than expected."
When they were allowed back in, he claimed, the devices were gone.
“Later we found out that our wearables were stolen," he wrote. “Only to see our wearables disappear inside a high-security zone. If only security and official entourage had access, how did this happen? This is extremely disappointing."
Day 1 of the AI Impact Summit turned to be a pain for us.I came genuinely excited, it was the first time the summit was being hosted in India, and I wanted to show up personally to support the ecosystem and the government’s push.
But what happened next was shocking.

--------------------
Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat on Tuesday reiterated that Hindu families should consider having at least three children. He was addressing a social-harmony meeting at Saraswati Shishu Mandir in Lucknow.
Bhagwat expressed concern over what he described as a declining Hindu population and called for uniting and empowering Hindu society. He said there is no threat but vigilance is necessary.
“There is a need to unite and empower Hindus. There is no threat to us but vigilance is necessary," Bhagwat said.
Bhagwat said Hindu families should consider at least three children. He cited scientific opinions that societies with an average fertility rate below three could disappear in the future.
He said newly married couples should be made aware of this. According to him, the purpose of marriage is to carry forward creation, not merely to fulfil personal desires.
Raising concerns over infiltration, Bhagwat said infiltrators should be detected, deleted and deported, and not given employment.
He stressed that lack of harmony leads to discrimination and said all citizens share one country and one motherland. He described Sanatan thought as a philosophy of harmony and said differences must be addressed through understanding and practice.
Responding to a question on UGC guidelines, Bhagwat said laws must be obeyed and flawed laws can be changed through constitutional means.
He said caste divisions should not cause conflict and called for uplifting the disadvantaged with a sense of belonging. Bhagwat added that India would guide the world in the near future and that many global problems have solutions in the country’s civilisational ethos.
He also cautioned that some elements in the United States and China are working against India’s social harmony and called for vigilance and mutual trust.

Several petitions have been filed in Patna High Court challenging the elections of over 40 elected members of the State Assembly, including Speaker Prem Kumar, Energy and Finance Minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav and others. The court has issued notices to the respondent legislators.
The petitions have been filed by the candidates who lost the election from their respective constituencies, and the court, in the usual course, has issued notices to the elected representatives from both ruling and Opposition parties, but the majority among them belong to the ruling NDA alliance parties.
“Usually, no election petition is dismissed by the court outright. Notices are issued to the respondents, and orders would be passed by the court after examining the material at hand”, said Siddharth Prasad, who represents the Election Commission in the court. The petitions, said to be over 40, have been filed by the candidates who have lost elections from their respective constituencies, said Mr. Prasad to media persons.
The petitions challenging the elections of newly elected MLAs, including the Speaker of the State Assembly and nine-term BJP MLA from Gaya town, Prem Kumar, senior Minister in Nitish Kumar's cabinet, Bijendra Prasad Yadav of JD-U, former Minister Jibesh Kumar Mishra of BJP, Chetan Anand (JD-U) and others. The petition against Prem Kumar has been filed by Akhauri Onkar Nath who had contested the election as Congress candidate and lost by 26, 423 votes.
Similarly, the court has issued notice to senior JD-U leader and nine-term MLA from Supaul, Bijendra Prasad Yadav, who is also the State’s Energy and Finance minister. Mr. Yadav had defeated Congress candidate Minnatullah Rahmani by over 30,000 votes.
The BJP candidate from Jale constituency in Darbhanga district and former Minister in Nitish Kumar's cabinet, Jibesh Mishra, too had defeated Congress candidate Rishi Mishra by over 20,000 votes. But, the ruling JD-U candidate from Nabinagar constituency of Aurangabad district, Chetan Anand, had won the poll by just 112 votes, defeating the Opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal candidate Amod Kumar Singh.
Most of the election petitions have been filed in the court citing alleged discrepancies in affidavits filed by the winning candidates concerned or, for violation of other provisions of the Representation of the People Act, said the EC counsel Siddharth Prasad. The petitions have also been challenged against RJD MLA from Goh constituency of Aurangabad, Amarendra Kumar and others too. The court has directed the MLAs to respond within the stipulated timeframe for further proceedings to take place.
However, some of Patna HC lawyers told The Hindu that “issuance of notices does not imply guilt but, yes, it marks that the court has found sufficient grounds to seek clarification from the respondents”. “Election petitions are a constitutional remedy available to candidates who wish to challenge results on grounds of discrepancies like procedural lapses, false declarations, corrupt practices etc.”, said senior advocate of the court, Amit Prakash.
In the 2025 two-phased State Assembly elections in Bihar, the NDA comprising the BJP, JD-U, Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), and Rashtriya Lok Morcha had won 202 seats out of a total of 243-member State Assembly, the Opposition mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) allies RJD had won 25, Congress 6, Left parties three seats and the rest are by others.

--------------------
The Supreme Court on Thursday reserved for judgment a petition filed by AIADMK leader Saidai S Duraisamy against a Madras High Court verdict dismissing his case linking Tamil Nadu Chief Minister and DMK leader M K Stalin to ‘corrupt practices’ ahead of the 2011 Assembly election to the Kolathur constituency.
A Bench of Justices J.K. Maheshwari and Vijay Bishnoi heard the submissions by the lawyers appearing for both parties.
Mr. Duraisamy had alleged that the DMK party used its functionaries and money power to lure voters in favour in innovative ways amounting to corrupt practice under Section 123 of the Representation of the People Act.
Mr. Stalin’s counsel, senior advocate Kapil Sibal, said the petitioner had no evidence, whatsoever, to show that the alleged corrupt practices, if any,were done with the express or deemed consent of the candidate. Mr. Sibal had argued that a mere “preponderance of probabilities” would not drive home a charge of corrupt practice like bribery of electors to vote in favour of a candidate under Section 123 of the 1951 Act.
The Madras High Court had dismissed the allegations raised by Mr. Duraisamy for lack of conclusive evidence in 2017. It had found that certain CDs brought forth by Mr. Duraisamy did not even comply with the “basic” requirement of a Section 65B certification. The provision mandates a certificate verifying the authenticity, integrity and source of a digital data before admitting it as evidence in court.
Mr. Duraisamy had contended that the DMK party had used the “’Thirumangalam Formula”’ to provide money to the voters in a novel way through community feedings, courier service, currency in newspapers, Arathi Plate contributions and slips to purchase consumer items, etc. A goods vehicle had been caught with boxes of currency.
However, the averments had not impressed the High Court, which came to the conclusion  that there was “no categorical averment that the 1st respondent (Mr. Stalin) had given his consent to his party functionaries to bribe the voters and self-help group members with a view to attract a misdeed of ‘corrupt practice’”.
“In regard to the allegation of money distribution by the 1st Respondent’s [Stalin] party by adopting Thirumangalam Formula in a novel way of community feedings, courier service, currency in News paper, Arathi Plate contributions and slips to the voters to purchase consumer items etc, this court points out that there is no convincing, satisfactory and acceptable proof produced on the side of the petitioner,” the High Court had noted.

The Karnataka State Travel Operators’ Association (KSTOA) has submitted a detailed memorandum to the State government ahead of the 2026–27 Budget, seeking road tax rationalisation, withdrawal of the additional 3% cess on commercial vehicles, and enhanced infrastructure support to boost the transport and tourism sectors.
The association submitted comprehensive suggestions as part of the pre-Budget consultation to the Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Transport Minister Ramalinga Reddy. The association said that the industry and transport sectors remain the economic lifeline of the State, providing employment to thousands despite economic slowdowns, fuel price fluctuations and natural calamities.
Citing official data for 2025-26, the association noted that Karnataka has a population of around 6.8 crore, with 53.6 lakh income tax filers and over 10 lakh active GST registrations. “Nearly 44% of the State’s own tax revenue comes from GST, and over 3 crore vehicles are registered in Karnataka. More than 35 lakh workers are covered under ESI, with 3-4 lakh new EPF registrations added annually,” the letter stated.
However, it flagged growing challenges faced by self-employed operators and entrepreneurs due to high road taxes, toll charges and rising operational costs. According to the association, some vehicle owners are opting to register their vehicles in other States to reduce tax burden. It urged the government to consider a rational reduction in road tax to prevent such migration and encourage registrations within Karnataka.
To help achieve the targets under the Tourism Policy 2024-29, the association sought tax exemptions or reductions for tourist vehicles, including mini buses, multi-utility vehicles. “Tax concessions and a hassle-free bilateral interstate agreement for private tourist vehicles would support seamless movement and revenue growth,”  KSTOA president K. Radhakrishna Holla said.
He also demanded reconsideration of the additional 3% cess imposed on yellow-board commercial vehicles in the 2025-26 Budget. He sought exemption for operators already contributing to ESI and PF for their employees.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Thursday (February 19, 2026) said online public services in Kerala had moved beyond announcements to become a lived reality, citing that over 10 lakh applications filed through the K-SMART platform were processed within an hour and more than two lakh building permits were issued within a minute.
Inaugurating the valedictory ceremony of Local Self-Government Day at the Mangattuparamba KAP Battalion ground, he said local bodies played a crucial role in Kerala. The State, he added, had consistently strengthened decentralisation and empowered local institutions.
Kerala has significantly enhanced financial support to local bodies, allocating over ₹70,000 crore since 2021. In the past five years alone, ₹8,867 crore has been provided for road works and ₹1,187 crore for anganwadi buildings. Under the Chief Minister’s local road construction project, 4,912 works have been completed in the first phase at a cost of ₹980 crore, while projects worth ₹939 crore are under way in the second phase.
The Chief Minister said nearly five lakh homes envisaged under the Life Mission were nearing completion. Kerala, he said, remained the best-performing State in implementing the rural employment guarantee scheme. On waste management, he said 1,027 local bodies had been declared solid waste-free.
He released the Local Self-Government department’s progress report and the logos for the second phase of the Extreme Poverty Eradication and Digi Kerala projects. Local Self-Government Minister M.B. Rajesh presided over the function and distributed awards, including the Swaraj Trophy and the Mahatma Awards.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan witnessed high-voltage Kalaripayattu performances at the Ponniyathangam festival on Thursday, spending over half an hour engrossed in martial arts demonstrations that captivated a packed audience.
The fourth day of the festival saw galleries filled to capacity as practitioners presented swift, fiery sequences featuring the Urumi, sword and shield, short sticks, fireball routines and combat drills. The Chief Minister watched the performances keenly from the stage, drawing applause from spectators.
Inaugurating the cultural meet held as part of the Ponniyathangam celebrations, Mr. Vijayan said the festival had already earned wide public acceptance. He noted that attendance had been rising each year and expressed confidence that the event would continue to grow stronger in the years ahead.
Assembly Speaker A. N. Shamseer presided over the function. The Chief Minister also launched a game model on Ponniyathangam, jointly developed by Thalassery Engineering College and the Kerala Professional Network.
Earlier, martial arts demonstrations were staged by the Ponniyathangam Kathirur Gurukul Memorial Kalari, Koyilandy Al-Mubarak Kalari and the Dubai Kalari Club. The programme also featured a folk dance competition and other performances, including a martial art display from Thang Aham Yanab on a separate stage.
More than 33 selected participants from across the country, attending as part of the Kerala Youth Leadership Academy, witnessed the festival. M. Gnaneshwar from Telangana said he was mesmerised by the event, which showcased the skill and heritage of Kerala’s traditional martial art. Biraja Mishra from Odisha said the active participation of people across age groups and communities, including Muslims, was striking. “It is unlike what we see in some other parts of the country. It reflects the cultural richness and secular outlook of the people here,” he said.
Live performances by Sachin Warrier and Libin Scaria added to the evening’s cultural line-up. Former Kerala Folklore Academy vice-chairman K. Kunhiraman, Kathirur grama panchayat president P. P. Sujaya, Eranholi grama panchayat president and other organisers attended the event.

--------------------
The Malleshwaram police registered a case on February 19 against a dermatologist for allegedly spreading misinformation about Nandini milk and dairy products through social media posts.
Based on the complaint, the police charged Dr. Sharanya Padma (MBBS, MD – Dermatology) under 353(1) (making, publishing, or circulating false information, rumours, or reports via any medium, including electronics. It aims to prevent public mischief, such as inciting mutiny, causing fear or alarm to the public, or promoting hatred between groups) and various sections of the IT act.
According to the complaint, the accused  reportedly claimed on videos that products such as Nandini cream buns, strawberry-flavoured powdered milk, and certain beverages contain toxic and harmful substances. She allegedly stated that regular consumption of these products could lead to autoimmune diseases and, in the long term, even cancer. The posts also claimed that the strawberry-flavoured milk powder did not contain natural strawberries but artificial colours and preservatives, and questioned how the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) had granted approval for such products.
The complainant further alleged that the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF), a government-owned cooperative, was manufacturing and marketing such products for profit, and described them as unsafe for consumption.
KMF, in a press release dated February 18 strongly refuted the allegations, terming them baseless and misleading. The federation clarified that it strictly adheres to all food safety standards and regulations prescribed by statutory authorities, including FSSAI, and assured consumers that Nandini milk and milk products are completely safe for consumption.
KMF stated that the social media posts had caused unnecessary confusion among millions of consumers who have trusted the Nandini brand for decades.

IT and Industries Minister D. Sridhar Babu on Thursday showcased Telangana’s plan to harness Artificial Intelligence and how Hyderabad on the back of its technology-led growth path is poised to emerge as an economic powerhouse like China’s Shenzhen.
The Minister, who is in Delhi in connection with the AI Impact Summit, told representatives of global strategic advisory firms such as Digital Governance Advisory and Albright Stonebridge Group, that the State government viewed safety in AI not as an obstacle to innovation. AI today is at a critical juncture and is in need of regulatory safeguards to build public trust.
Telangana government is taking AI technology to the grassroots level with sustainability as a core growth strategy. It has also announced plans to develop an AI City spread across 765 sq km and India’s first net-zero city Bharat Future City, designed for sustainable living.
He spoke of country’s first sovereign AI hub AIKAM the State has established, the Telangana Data Exchange (TGDeX) initiative, which is the world’s first sovereign open data pipeline, making 1,084 datasets (500 GB) from 28 government departments publicly usable. Currently, 360 AI models utilise this data and more than 950 experts and startups are actively working on the platform.
As part of proactive governance, the Integrated Digital Services Platform (IDSP) will deliver over 300 government services to 40 million citizens by 2027. The State aims to become a global AI hub and aspiring to become a $3 trillion economy by 2047.
The Minister said more than half of the growth of Hyderabad’s current $80-billion economy has been driven by its technology professionals. He sought to draw a parallel to Shenzhen in China, which from a small fishing village of the 1980s has shaped over time into a manufacturing hub and now is a $500-billion economic powerhouse.
Telangana and Hyderabad are at a similar transformational moment — except the growth engine is technology, not manufacturing, the Minister’s office said in a release on his keynote address at the meeting with the representatives of the advisory firms.
Addressing the US–India Business Council (USIBC) round table, Mr.Sridhar Babu highlighted how Telangana is emerging as a platform for AI–driven innovation and offering numerous opportunities for U.S. investors.

A day after it skipped a joint appearance with other countries at the United Nations to condemn Israel for its plans for West Bank settlements, India signed a joint statement late on Wednesday (February 18, 2026) night.
The statement, which was read out by the Palestinian Ambassador to the UN, Riyad Mansour, on Tuesday (February 17) in New York, criticised the Israeli government for a number of moves to expand its control over the West Bank areas under the Palestinian Authority.
Among those who accompanied Mr. Mansour during the joint press call were diplomats from Arab nations, BRICS members, Quad partners Japan and Australia, European Union member states such as Germany, and all permanent members of the UN Security Council, except for the U.S.
India’s initial decision not to sign the statement, which was endorsed by 85 countries, was seen as linked to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s travel to Israel on February 25-26 and his upcoming meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The decision was surprising given India’s traditional support for a Palestinian state and its past criticism of Israel’s settlement policy.
However, more than 24 hours later, the government appeared to shift its position and signed the document.
“More than 100 states and international organizations have joined the statement condemning Israel’s unilateral measures and rejecting annexation,” the Palestinian government announced late on Wednesday (February 18), including India’s name in the statement.
“We reiterate our rejection of all measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem,” said the statement issued in New York. “Such measures violate international law, undermine the ongoing efforts for peace and stability in the region, run counter to the Comprehensive Plan, and jeopardize the prospect of reaching a peace agreement ending the conflict,” it added.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who travelled to Delhi to attend the AI Impact Summit on Wednesday (February 18), had also issued a statement “condemning” the Israeli government’s plans to require documentation from existing landholders and ease restrictions on outsiders acquiring property in the West Bank.
“The decision could lead to the dispossession of Palestinians of their property and risks expanding Israeli control over land in the area. Such measures, including Israel’s continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, are not only destabilizing but, as recalled by the International Court of Justice, unlawful,” the statement issued by the Secretary-General’s office said.
The External Affairs Ministry refused requests for a comment on the government’s decisions, first to stay away from the joint appearance and then to sign the statement.
The government’s decision to stay out of the statement was criticised by the Opposition and former diplomats, some of whom praised the decision to join the statement later.
Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said Mr. Modi must “call out” Mr. Netanyahu during his visit to Israel next week and “publicly express India’s grave concern at what Israel is executing in the occupied West Bank”.

Hyderabad
Telangana Jagruti president Kalvakuntla Kavitha, on Thursday, announced that her proposed political party would be formally launched in the first week of May, and she would prefer to contest from Siddipet, which is now held by her cousin T. Harish Rao and earlier represented by her father and BRS chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao.
In an informal chat with the media, she said that the new party would be rooted firmly in Telangana and with its political ideology. On her choice of contest, she said that it would be either Siddpet or Bodhan.
Ms. Kavitha said that her party would continuously question the policies and actions of the Congress, Bharatiya Janata Party and Bharat Rashtra Samithi. She also predicted that the BJP’s presence in Telangana would gradually diminish.
On future electoral strategy, she said that her party would consider contesting the MPTC and ZPTC elections in alliance with another party. She was hopeful that by the time of the GHMC elections, the Election Commission would allot a symbol to her party, and asserted that the party would contest the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation polls on its own symbol.
She revealed that several leaders from the BRS were keen to join her new party and that many of them were already in touch with her. “I will share details when the time is right,” she said.
Responding to criticism about the prospects of her new party, she questioned why failed male-led political experiments were rarely discussed. Why leaders such as Chiranjeevi and Devender Goud were not similarly scrutinised, and why Rajagopal Reddy’s political shifts were not discussed. “No one talks about them, but women are constantly undermined,” she said.

--------------------
Karnataka has around 260 blood banks, including government and private facilities.

In a move aimed at bringing uniform quality standards across all blood centres, the State Health Department has made it mandatory for all blood banks in Karnataka to obtain accreditation from the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH) or certification under the National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) programme within a year.
The directive has been issued through a Government Order dated February 17, 2026, following a proposal from the Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS) and consultations with NABH authorities.
The proposal stated that ensuring all blood centres in the State function in accordance with the guidelines of the National Blood Transfusion Council, the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, the Directorate General of Health Services, New Delhi, the Karnataka State Blood Transfusion Council, and the directives of the State and Central governments is the responsibility of the Karnataka State Blood Transfusion Council.
With a view to preventing transfusion-transmitted infections and strengthening the proper management of blood centres, consultations were held with the NABH authorities before the decision was finalised, officials said.
State Deputy Director (Blood Safety) Shakila N. told The Hindu on Thursday that the move was intended to reinforce systems governing blood collection, testing and storage. “Blood banks deal with life-saving services. There are multiple processes involved- from donor screening and blood collection to testing, component separation and storage. Each of these steps must meet defined standards, with proper infrastructure, trained human resources and calibrated equipment,” she said.
Karnataka has around 260 blood banks, including government and private facilities. As per the order, all government blood banks must obtain the NQAS certification. The blood centres functioning under autonomous institutions of the government may opt for either NQAS certification or NABH accreditation. However, all private blood banks, which are not eligible under the government-run NQAS scheme, must obtain the NABH accreditation, according to the order.
All existing blood banks have been given one year to secure the prescribed accreditation. New blood banks will be required to obtain accreditation within one year from the date of receiving their licence.
Existing blood banks have been given one year to comply. Newly licensed blood banks must obtain accreditation within one year from the date of licence. Licences are renewed once every five years, with periodic inspections by district-level officers. “Monitoring private blood banks on a day-to-day basis can be challenging. This move will ensure an additional layer of quality oversight,” Dr. Shakila said.
Referring to reports from other States where lapses in testing allegedly resulted in transfusion-related infections, she said both the Central and State governments were keen to tighten safeguards.
The accreditation process involves documentation of standard operating procedures, infrastructure assessment and compliance checks, and may take eight to ten months. The cost of accreditation will be borne by the respective blood banks. Failure to obtain certification within the stipulated period will result in suspension of licence, the order stated.
Dr. Shakila said joint inspections by the State Drugs Control Department and the Health Department had identified procedural lapses in some blood banks in the past, and action had been initiated wherever necessary. “Safe blood is non-negotiable,” Dr. Shakila added.

The School Education Department in Andhra Pradesh has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the International Innovation Corps (IIC), under the aegis of Chicago University Trust (India), to improve the effective implementation of the ‘Dokka Seethamma Midday Meal Scheme’ in government schools.
The MoU was signed during a meeting held at the office of the Secretary, Department of Human Resource Development, Kona Sasidhar on Thursday, in the presence of the Director of Midday Meal Scheme and School Sanitation and State Project Director of Samagra Shiksha B. Srinivas Rao, Commissioner and Director of Collegiate Education Narayana Bharat Gupta and ICC representatives Rishik Modi (Senior Manager), Shraddha Srivastava (Engagement Manager), Tushar Malhotra (Project Associate) and others.
Mr. Sasidhar said that the MoU would facilitate enhanced quality services to approximately 3.23 million students who get meals daily in 42,230 schools and colleges in the State and enable the department to leverage modern technologies such as data analytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve transparency and efficiency in implementation of the scheme.
The IIC team will assist in accurately estimating the number of students consuming meals, monitoring nutritional standards, reducing administrative burden and enabling faster decision making, he said.
The officials hoped that this partnership would elevate the Midday Meal Scheme in the State to a higher stage of digital governance.

--------------------
The State government has initiated steps to redistribute the existing staff of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation among the three new corporations proposed in place of the GHMC
The State government has announced its resolve to create Cyberabad and Malkajgiri municipal corporations, retaining the core city under the GHMC. Accordingly, it has started the exercise to redeploy the existing staff at different levels to the three corporations holding consultations with different departments and experts on the options available.  The development assumes significance as litigations have been filed in the High Court over the reorganisation of the GHMC at a time when there is a freeze on altering the profile of administrative unit till the Census work is completed.
There are broadly three categories of employees: GHMC-born or those recruited directly to the corporation, officials and staff belonging to the Municipal Administration department in key sections like Town Planning and staff working on deputation from other departments like Forests. This is in addition to the huge number of contract and outsourcing workers engaged in different sections.
Officials see no scope for problems on account of redeployment, as factors like Presidential Orders and local status will not come into play. “Some employees are already in positions. Mechanism has to be evolved to redeploy the staff to make the three new corporations function effectively in discharge of their duties,”  senior officials told The Hindu.
While redistribution of employees is unlikely to pose any major problems, officials, however, feel that the division of assets and liabilities between the three new bodies will be a challenging task before the government.

The Joint Action Committee (JAC) of Road Transport Corporation (RTC) workers’ unions, which had organised a ‘Bengaluru Chalo’ on Thursday pressing for the fulfilment of various long-pending demands, has temporarily withdrawn its strike plan after fresh assurances from the State government.
The unions have issued a March 2 deadline, warning that the agitation will resume if the government fails to implement the pay revision order in full and release the entire arrears due to employees.
On Wednesday, Transport Minister Ramalinga Reddy had announced that the State had agreed to release 26 months of salary arrears amounting to ₹1,271.92 crore to officers and employees of the four State-run transport corporations — Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC), Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC), North Western Karnataka Road Transport Corporation(NWKRTC), and Kalyana Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (KKRTC).
Despite this, transport employees maintained that their core demand remained pending. The unions are insisting that arrears for the entire 38-month period be cleared, instead of the 26 months proposed by the government.
As part of the negotiations, KSRTC managing director Akram Pasha visited the protest site at Freedom Park in Bengaluru and held discussions with the agitating workers. Following a final round of talks, the Joint Action Committee announced that the strike would be temporarily halted for now.
JAC convener Jayadevaraj Arasu said that  the decision was taken in view of the government’s partial response and in the interest of the public.
“The Joint Action Committee has decided not to continue the strike from tomorrow. However, we have given the government a 10-day deadline until March 2. If our demands are not fully met by then, we will resume the agitation,” he said.
He further emphasised that all pending demands, including the complete implementation of the pay revision and full disbursal of arrears, must be addressed within the stipulated timeframe. “With the strike plan on hold for the moment, bus services will operate as usual from tomorrow,” he added.
However, not all employees at the protest site were in agreement with the decision. Some workers present at Freedom Park reportedly objected to the temporary withdrawal and urged union leaders to continue the strike until all demands were met unconditionally. But JAC leaders convinced them.
Meanwhile, RTC officials stated that the protest had little impact on bus services across the State on Thursday, with overall fleet utilisation exceeding 96%.
A total of 12,458 scheduled departures were planned across the four corporations. Of these, 11,987 services were operated, resulting in an overall operational rate of 96.22%.
Additionally, 663 extra services were deployed, taking the total number of operated services to 12,650. This pushed the effective operational percentage, including additional trips, to 101.54 as of 10 a.m. on the day of the protest.
KSRTC operated 3,806 out of its 4,177 scheduled departures, recording 91.12% operations. With 656 additional services run under ‘Jatra’ (temple fair) arrangements, its effective operational percentage rose to 106.82%.
BMTC recorded near-full operations, running 3,540 services against 3,532 scheduled departures, achieving 100.23% efficiency without deploying any additional services.
NWKRTC operated 2,250 of its 2,310 scheduled departures, registering 97.40% operations. With seven extra services operated to meet the jatra demand, its effective operation rate increased to 97.71%.
KKRTC reported operating 2,391 out of 2,439 scheduled departures, achieving 98.03% operations.
Commuters expressed relief over the development.
Pavan Kumar from Jayanagar, said, “There were no issues today. All buses operated as usual, and passengers did not face any inconvenience. However, I feel the government and the unions must resolve this issue permanently. Frequent protests create uncertainty, and ultimately it is commuters who suffer. The government should ensure that RTC employees receive their arrears on time. They are doing an essential public service.”
The current agitation follows earlier tensions between the unions and the government. In August 2025, the JAC announced an indefinite strike after talks with the government failed. The strike was later withdrawn following intervention by the Karnataka High Court.
The ‘Bengaluru Chalo’ protest was originally scheduled for January 29 but was postponed after veteran trade union leader H.V. Anantha Subba Rao, who was spearheading the agitation, passed away on January 28 following a cardiac arrest. The programme was subsequently rescheduled and held on February 19.

Blaming YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) for the financial crisis that crippled the State, Finance Minister Payyavula Keshav said that the public debt stood at nearly ₹1.20 lakh crore even after 20 months of the coalition government’s formation. The TDP-led government inherited a mammoth debt of approximately ₹9.74 lakh crore from the YSRCP dispensation in June 2024.
It had since been a daily struggle for the Finance Department to run the show with meagre revenues on the one hand and a mountain of debt on the other, but the situation improved significantly as the State’s efforts were complemented by the Central support. However, much more remained to be done as the YSRCP government’s policies had a lasting impact, he observed, while cautioning the people against voting for the YSRCP again.
Giving his reply to the general discussion on Budget 2026-27 in the Legislative Assembly on Thursday, Mr. Keshav said the first budget tabled by him had to clean up the mess created by the YSRCP and the second one just about managed to put the economy back on the tracks.
The third (the present one) shifted gears towards all-round progress, he claimed, and insisted that continuity of governance was a must for the State to prosper, for which the people should once again vote for the TDP-Jana Sena Party-BJP alliance. The YSRCP rule was characterised by corruption and fiscal profligacy, he remarked.
Further, Mr. Keshav said due emphasis had been laid on generating employment. Salaries and pensions were being paid before the first of every month. '’Focus has been laid on developing Visakhapatnam, Amaravati and Tirupati Economic Regions and the masterplan for the Visakhapatnam Economic Region has been drafted under the expert guidance of NITI Aayog. The Amaravati Economic Region is being studied,'’ he said.
Completing the irrigation projects was quite high on the government’s agenda. The Amaravati and Polavaram projects were taken up with renewed vigour. Industrial projects were taking tangible shape wherever lands were allotted, unlike during the YSRCP regime when entrepreneurs fled from the State due to hostile conditions. Mr. Keshav added.

The State government on Thursday demanded an unconditional apology from the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) over its claim that no adulteration had taken place in the ghee supplied to the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) during its term between 2019 and 2024.
Agriculture Minister Kinjarapu Atchannaidu said that Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council Botcha Satyanarayana was maintaining that no adulteration had occurred despite laboratory reports and findings of the Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team (SIT).
He said the party should tender an unconditional apology in the Legislative Council and to devotees of Lord Venkateswara worldwide.
Speaking to reporters in the Legislative Assembly corridors, Mr. Atchannaidu said that unless the YSRCP apologised for what he described as false claims, the government would not agree to a discussion on the issue in the Council, as was being demanded by the opposition party over the past three days.
He alleged that the SIT findings had established facts and even former TTD Chairman Y. V. Subba Reddy had acknowledged the report.
Responding to allegations regarding Heritage Foods, the Minister said the company had a long-standing policy of not supplying products to government institutions, including the TTD. He added that the TTD was procuring pure cow ghee at around ₹650 per kg through auction, compared to an estimated market price of about ₹1,000.

The next Artificial Intelligence (AI) Impact Summit in 2027 will be held in Geneva, announced Switzerland’s President Guy Parmelin, making a pitch for smaller countries to “come together” to ensure good governance of AI development, so it is not held in the hands of a few “big powers”. Mr. Parmelin, who also met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi for bilateral talks on Thursday (February 19, 2026) on the sidelines of the AI summit in New Delhi, said they had discussed cooperating in innovation on artificial intelligence, multilateral cooperation, and trade ties after the conclusion of the India-EFTA trade agreement in 2024.

“Switzerland is looking forward to hosting the 2027 AI Summit in Geneva — and to working with the subsequent incoming host of the 2028 AI Summit, the United Arab Emirates, as partner for the Geneva Summit,” Mr. Parmelin told journalists at Switzerland’s “Country Pavilion” at the Bharat Mandapam complex after the plenary session. “It will also consolidate our role as a leading centre for innovation and research in AI,” he added, saying that the next summit would focus on international law aspects of AI.
When asked about the domination of the two big AI players U.S. and China, who together account for more than 70% of the global AI industry, Mr. Parmelin said smaller countries should “organise” together and build infrastructure, while recognising specific technological breakthroughs in many of the other countries.
“It is very important that we work together so that the [technological future of the world] is not just in a few hands of big powers,” Mr. Parmelin said in response to a question from The Hindu. “We know some countries have taken a way forward, and it’s very important that good governance is brought to everyone. Notably, countries like South Korea, France, Switzerland, need to work together to bring good governance to other countries,” he added.
In a statement after his meeting with Mr. Modi, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said both leaders had discussed the benefits of the Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement (TEPA) between India the four-nation European Free Trade association (EFTA) for bilateral trade.
“Both sides agreed to further strengthen collaboration in innovation-led growth, joint research, sharing of best practices, and capacity building through training and skill development initiatives,” the MEA statement said.
Mr. Modi welcomed plans to hold the Fifth Summit in Switzerland. Since the first summit in the U.K. in 2023, AI Impact Summits have been hosted by South Korea, France, and India.

Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Thursday (February 19, 2026) released a “people’s charge sheet” against the “corrupt” Bharatiya Janata Party-led government in poll-bound Assam, accusing it of institutionalising “syndicate raj” and giving the lands of the indigenous people away to corporate houses.
The 20-page document incorporated the angst of the people from across Assam, the State Congress leaders said. It was released at a hall in Guwahati named after Manabendra Sarma, a Congress leader murdered in the 1990s.
The charge sheet accused the BJP of establishing a parallel economy by patronising and promoting illegal activities, including rat-hole coal mining, and turning Assam into a conduit for drugs, Burmese areca nuts, and other contraband items from across the international borders.
It claimed that Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, Ministers close to him, and members of his family accumulated illegal wealth, generating “slush funds through an organised syndicate system” and investing the proceeds in real estate, shell companies, and other ventures.
The document touched upon Assam’s “rising debts, irresponsible governance, and financial mismanagement”. It said that the State’s outstanding debt crossed ₹2 lakh crore, increasing the financial burden on people and future generations.
“The government is taking loans not for reforms or productive investments, but to fund various freebies aimed at electoral winnability… The money of the people of Assam, which should have been used to build infrastructure and provide water, roads, and basic amenities, is instead being diverted and used primarily for political purposes,” the document read.
Congress also accused the BJP government of sabotaging the “universally accepted Assam Accord of 1985” and the “deliberate non-implementation of Clause 6 that guarantees the protection of Assamese Identity” despite repeated assurances.
The charge sheet alleged that the BJP undermined the sanctity of the Assam Accord by introducing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the Immigration and Foreigners (Exemption) Order, 2025. It stated that the BJP stalled the exercise to update the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and blackmailed communities by promoting a fear psychosis through official channels.
Criticising the BJP for failing to declare the perennial problems of floods and riverbank erosion in Assam as a national disaster, the document highlighted the State government’s inability to create adequate jobs and grant Scheduled Tribe status to six communities — Chutia, Koch-Rajbongshi, Matak, Moran, Tai Ahom, and Tea Tribes.
The document also said the BJP had weakened and stifled public education, leaving children of the poor in the lurch. It pointed to the merger or closure of more than 9,000 State-run schools without taking the people into confidence.

LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/rss-affiliate-laghu-udyog-bharati-urges-govt-to-drop-blue-line-plan-for-antimicrobial-drugs-9918704.html
--------------------
A month after the central government mandated marking antimicrobial drugs with a conspicuous blue vertical line, RSS-affiliated Laghu Udyog Bharati (LUB) has urged the health ministry not to proceed with the final notification, arguing that the move would impose heavy economic and environmental costs without meaningfully addressing antimicrobial misuse.
In a letter dated February 18, seen by News18, LUB has requested the government “to reconsider the proposed amendment under global prospective and consider our above factful submission and do not go for final notification".
LUB is an all-India organisation representing micro and small enterprises (MSMEs) and claims to represent over 64,000 members across the country.
The blue line proposal was introduced through draft notification in January, proposing an amendment to Rule 96 of the Drugs Rules, 1945, to mandate “a conspicuous blue vertical strip on the labels of antimicrobial drugs".
Antimicrobial drugs include antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals and antiparasitic medicines used to treat infections caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites. India has been grappling with rising antimicrobial resistance (AMR), largely driven by irrational use, self-medication and over-the-counter availability of antibiotics despite prescription requirements.
The proposed blue line is intended to function as a clear visual identifier, reinforcing that these medicines should be used strictly under medical supervision. It builds on earlier regulatory efforts such as the red line warning introduced in 1993 and the later red box warning under Schedule H1.
However, LUB argues that past visual labelling interventions have not significantly altered misuse patterns. In its letter, the organisation states, “Experience from earlier labelling interventions shows that such changes do not materially impact misuse." It notes that despite decades of red line and red box warnings, “irrational use and over-the-counter sale of antibiotics continue".
In its representation, seen by News18, LUB contends that the amendment would require manufacturers to redesign labels, revise approved artworks and discard existing packaging material. “The proposed requirement will necessitate redesigning of labels, revision of approved artworks, and disposal of existing printed packaging material, resulting in significant financial and operational burden, particularly for MSME manufacturers," the letter said. It warns that sudden implementation could lead to “losses running into crores of rupees for even a single manufacturing unit".
The organisation also flags environmental implications, pointing out that pharmaceutical packaging relies on pre-printed aluminium foils and specialised printing cylinders. Large-scale destruction of these materials, it said, would generate industrial waste and increase pollution. The letter cautions that repeated labelling changes would lead to “high economic and environmental costs without delivering commensurate public health benefits".
LUB further argues that antimicrobial drugs are already governed under Schedule H and Schedule H1 with specific labelling and prescription requirements. According to the letter, “The addition of another visual identifier, such as a blue line, may create confusion among healthcare professionals and patients rather than improving rational use." It also raises concerns that mandatory domestic labelling changes could disrupt export packaging and regulatory harmonisation, potentially affecting manufacturing efficiency and India’s competitiveness.
Ultimately, the organisation maintains that the core issue lies in weak enforcement at the distribution and retail level. “Antimicrobial misuse is primarily driven by weak enforcement at the distribution and retail level, where antibiotics continue to be available over the counter despite existing legal restrictions," the letter stated, suggesting stronger enforcement and accountability measures rather than additional visual markers.
Concluding the letter, LUB has urged the ministry to take a broader view before proceeding, stating: “In view of the above, we humbly request the ministry to reconsider the proposed amendment under global prospective and consider our above factful submission and do not go for final notification."

The lounge is part of the newly launched ‘Bharat GI’ initiative — a national umbrella intellectual property brand introduced by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) to promote India’s Geographical Indication (GI) products globally. Positioned as “A World Exclusive," the initiative aims to give Indian GI products international recognition and premium positioning.
The Coffee Board’s activities are broadly aimed at enhancing production, productivity, quality and exports of Indian coffee, with GI-tagged varieties now being showcased to a global audience at the summit.
Pichai, who is participating in the summit, described artificial intelligence as ushering in an era of “hyper progress," with the potential to unlock new scientific discoveries and help emerging economies leapfrog traditional development stages.
The India AI Impact Summit — billed as the world’s largest AI gathering — began on Monday and has drawn tech leaders, policymakers, founders and global delegates. India is using the platform to push for wider access to AI technologies and promote inclusive innovation.
Alongside the summit, the India AI Impact Expo 2026 is being held from February 16–21 at Bharat Mandapam. Spread across 10 arenas and over 70,000 square metres, the expo features more than 300 exhibition pavilions, 13 country delegations, and over 600 startups demonstrating AI-driven solutions.
With over 500 sessions and more than 3,000 speakers scheduled, the event aims to advance global cooperation on AI governance, safety and equitable technological progress — while also offering visitors a taste of India’s finest GI coffee.

TITLE: PM Modi's Jam-Packed Schedule At AI Summit: From Meetings With World Leaders To CEO Roundtable
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/pm-modis-jam-packed-schedule-at-ai-summit-from-meetings-with-world-leaders-to-ceo-roundtable-9918596.html
--------------------
Prime Minister Narendra Modi had a packed itinerary at the India AI Impact Summit 2026 held at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi, where he conducted bilateral meetings with several world leaders and addressed both the Leaders’ Plenary Session and the CEO Roundtable forum.
Thursday was the most high-profile day of the Indian AI Summit, featuring keynotes from top tech CEOs and speeches by PM Modi, French President Emmanuel Macron and other leaders. Microsoft founder Bill Gates pulled out of the summit just hours before he was scheduled to speak.
PM Modi welcomed participants to what he called the most historic AI Summit in the world. He also posed for a group photograph with global technology leaders, including Sundar Pichai, Sam Altman, Alexandr Wang and Dario Amodei at the summit in Delhi.
PM Modi Inaugurates AI Summit
The Prime Minister’s jam-packed schedule began with the inauguration of the AI Summit at Bharat Mandapam today. Addressing the event, Modi said India is home to the world’s largest youth population, the biggest tech talent pool, and a thriving tech-enabled ecosystem.
The Prime Minister asserted that AI is making machines intelligent and multiplying human capacity. He remarked that the real question is not what AI can do in the future, but what humanity chooses to do with AI in the present, drawing parallels with nuclear power. He said the purpose of the summit was to deliberate how AI can be made human-centric, sensitive and responsible.
He also outlined his MANAV vision for AI, which stands for Moral and Ethical Systems, Accountable Governance, National Sovereignty, Accessible and Inclusive, and Valid and Legitimate. Stressing the need for global standards, PM Modi said India’s MANAV Vision will become a crucial link for humanity’s welfare in the AI-driven world of the 21st century.
PM Modi Addresses Leaders’ Plenary Session
The Prime Minister also shared his remarks at the Leaders’ Plenary Session of the AI Summit, where he expressed confidence that the summit will play a crucial role in building a human‑centric and sensitive global AI ecosystem.

PM Modi emphasised the importance of making AI technology accessible to all and placing the aspirations and priorities of the Global South at the centre of AI governance. He suggested several steps for ethical use of AI – including a data framework, clear safety rules, and human guidance.
He also outlined India’s steps in AI, such as adding GPUs, providing world-class computing power to startups and creating an AI fund. He underlined the need to build an AI future that advances innovation, strengthens inclusion, and integrates human values.
Bilateral Talks With World Leaders
Next, Prime Minister Modi held bilateral meetings with top leaders of Greece, Switzerland and the Netherlands, focusing on boosting ties in areas of trade and investment and critical technologies including semiconductors.
Modi also met Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Khaled bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and the discussions centred around boosting cooperation in futuristic sectors such as artificial intelligence, supercomputers, and data centres.
Both leaders reaffirmed the importance of the India-UAE Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, which is underpinned by strong political, cultural, commercial, energy and people-to-people ties, according to an official release.
CEO Roundtable
The Prime Minister then addressed the CEO Roundtable at the AI Impact Summit, which brought together various stakeholders from the world of AI, technology and innovation. “The discussions were insightful and forward-looking, focused on scaling AI responsibly, strengthening global collaboration and unlocking opportunities for growth," he said on X.

--------------------
Former British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak made a light-hearted remark about Delhi’s traffic congestion while addressing the India AI Impact Summit in Bharat Mandapam, saying that artificial intelligence can do many things, but can’t fix the national capital’s traffic.
“Sorry we’re a few minutes late, that’s entirely my fault. AI can do many things, as we’ve heard this week, but it can’t yet fix Delhi’s traffic. So, work to do," Sunak said, drawing laughter from the audience, news agency PTI reported.

His comments came against the backdrop of heavy traffic snarls across key stretches of the national capital during the ongoing summit at Bharat Mandapam.
Severe traffic congestion and repeated route diversions have turned the daily commute into a harrowing experience for thousands of commuters, with vehicles crawling across several key stretches of Delhi.
Heavy traffic snarls were reported from Sunehri Bagh, Sansad Marg, Prithviraj Road, Indraprastha Park flyover and routes leading to the airport, with several commuters claiming they remained stuck for hours due to movement restrictions linked to VIP security arrangements.
Visuals from central Delhi showed long queues of vehicles crawling at a snail’s pace, with some stretches witnessing near-complete standstill during peak evening hours.
Several commuters took to social media to vent their frustration, with some claiming they were stuck for up to four hours due to movement restrictions linked to VIP security arrangements.
“Crazy gridlock of traffic in central Delhi. Stuck for more than an hour. Due to the VVIP movement, our movement gets restricted. Nobody cares for normal people who are working hard every day," one commuter wrote.
Others reported frequent rerouting on navigation apps as roads were abruptly closed. Many advised residents to rely on the Delhi Metro instead of private vehicles during the summit period.
The Delhi Traffic Police had earlier issued an advisory stating that elaborate arrangements and traffic regulations were being implemented from February 16 to 20 for the smooth conduct of the AI Impact Summit at Bharat Mandapam, which is being attended by heads of state, ministers and foreign delegates.
According to the advisory, traffic movement was restricted or regulated on key roads including Mathura Road, Subramania Bharti Marg, Rajesh Pilot Marg, Janpath, Firoze Shah Road, Safdarjung Road and Kartavya Path, among others. Certain stretches like Bhairon Marg and parts of Mathura Road were designated restricted zones during route movement.
Meanwhile, in his keynote address, the former English Prime Minister called India the ideal venue for shaping the future of artificial intelligence, saying there was “no better place" to deliberate on global AI transformation.
Praising India’s digital public infrastructure such as Aadhaar, UPI and Ayushman Bharat Health Accounts, he said that the country was uniquely positioned to drive the next phase of AI’s global journey — not only for developed nations but also for the developing world.
Highlighting the speed of AI adoption, he noted that while the telephone took 75 years to reach 100 million users and the internet seven years, ChatGPT reached that milestone in just two months.
The India AI Impact Summit 2026, the first global AI summit to be hosted in the Global South, has brought together representatives from more than 110 countries to advance discussions on AI governance, safety and inclusive growth.

TITLE: Intelligence Agencies Sound Alarm Over Rohingyas, Infiltration In Bengal After Bangladesh Elections
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/intelligence-agencies-sound-alarm-over-rohingyas-infiltration-in-bengal-after-bangladesh-elections-ws-l-9918467.html
--------------------
After the recent elections in Bangladesh, intelligence agencies in India have sounded an alarm over Rohingya refugees, illegal immigration, terror networks and demographic changes in West Bengal ahead of the upcoming Assembly polls, sources told CNN-News18.
In an election marred by violence targeting religious minorities and widespread irregularities, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), led by former PM Khaleda Zia’s son Tarique Rahman, secured a strong mandate, winning 209 of the 299 seats, while the Jamaat-e-Islami secured 68 seats, making it the chief opposition party. Ousted PM Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League was banned from contesting the polls.
However, intelligence agencies have warned that Pakistan’s ISI is colluding with the Jamaat-e-Islami and using its seats in Bangladesh’s Satkhira and Chuadanga to push illegal immigrants into West Bengal’s Nadia and Murshidabad districts, according to sources.
Additionally, Jamaat’s radical spread is being used to activate terror sleeper cells in North 24 Parganas to influence voter turnout during the West Bengal Assembly elections, sources said. These sleeper cells are also aiming to disrupt the elections in Malda.
Attempts At Demographic Change In Bengal
According to sources, Malda’s Muslim population is estimated at 55-60%, which is mainly due to cross-border migration and Jamaat-e-Islami’s victory in Bangladesh’s Chapainawabganj, which lies close to Bengal’s Malda and Murshidabad districts.
Additionally, intelligence agencies warned of attempts at demographic change and settlements of sleeper cells affiliated with terror groups with the help of Rohingya networks.
Groups such as ARSA (Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army), RSO (Rohingya Solidarity Organisation), and JMB (Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh) are likely to coordinate their activities in Cox’s Bazar following the Bangladesh elections. This is expected to affect West Bengal’s Uttar Dinajpur district, with madrasa-linked networks in Birbhum potentially serving as key hubs.
Pakistan-China-Bangladesh Links
Intelligence reports also pointed to links involving Pakistan and China, allegedly aimed at targeting Siliguri through the Kurigram airbase. Jamaat’s ideological infiltration into West Bengal’s borders could have potential for communal riots in Jalpaiguri and may impact voter safety and Trinamool Congress’ (TMC) hold in 2026.
Several steps have been taken recently to address the issue, including the return of a large number of undocumented Bangladeshis in North 24 Parganas during the Election Commission’s Special Intensive Revision (SIR) process. BSF reported that at least 150–200 people are returning daily after verification, biometric checks and screening of criminal records.
Migrants working as ragpickers, labourers or domestic workers, who have been living in India for more than 10 years using forged Aadhaar cards, voter IDs, and ration cards, are also returning due to fear of arrest and imprisonment linked to the SIR exercise.

--------------------
A vigilance probe into the alleged misappropriation of funds from the sale of ghee at Sabarimala has named 33 persons as accused, including Temple Special Officers and nearly 30 counter staff.
While hearing the matter, the High Court expressed strong displeasure over the manner in which records were maintained. The court said it was “shocking to note the callous and casual manner in which records are maintained, and the income generated from the sale of sacred offerings is accounted for."
The judges observed that even a small shopkeeper would be expected to maintain better financial discipline. “Even a person running a modest petty shop would be expected to maintain far better accounting discipline to ensure that income and stock are properly reconciled," the court remarked.
According to the proceedings, ghee packets were issued to counters after being recorded in notebooks informally referred to as “Kutti Books". Separate notebooks were maintained for each counter and kept in the temple office. These books recorded the number of packets issued along with the signatures of the staff receiving them.
Investigating officers produced one such 200-page school notebook before the court, relating to the Maramathu-II counter. On examining it, the court noted that entries covering the period from 17 November 2025 to 30 December 2025 occupied only about 20 pages. The notebook also contained several corrections, overwriting and interlineations, which drew the court’s disapproval.
The court further observed that the Temple Board and its officials were expected to exercise much greater supervision, especially since the sale of offerings generates several lakhs of rupees daily.

India AI Summit 2026: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei drew netizens’ eyes after they raised clenched fists instead of holding hands during a group photograph with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi on Thursday.
PM Modi, on the fourth day of the summit, was on stage, flanked by the likes of Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, Meta’s Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang, Google Deepmind CEO Demis Hassabis, Sarvam co-founder Pratyush Kumar, Altman, and Amodei, for a group photo.
Altman and Amodei, standing next to each other, contemplated for a few seconds whether they wanted to hold hands. Eventually, they raised clenched fists instead of holding each other’s hands like others.
Sam Altman and Dario Amodei being forced to hold hands like two toddlers who just bit each other at daycare is the absolute peak of this summit. The sheer physical repulsion radiating off them is enough to power AGI. 🤣🤣🤣 pic.twitter.com/6gnfaZCCUv— Quant@Python (@BeingHorizontal) February 19, 2026
Meanwhile, Altman clarified about the momentary hesitation he shared with Amodei at the international stage, saying that he was confused about what he was supposed to be do on the stage.
Speaking to Moneycontrol, Altman said that he was “sort of confused" when Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was at the centre of the stage, grabbed his hand and thrust it upwards. “I just wasn’t sure what we were supposed to be doing," he told the news outlet.
The awkward moment highlighted the growing rivalry between OpenAI, led by Sam Altman, and Anthropic, headed by Dario Amodei.
Anthropic was founded in 2021 by former OpenAI executives, including Amodei, who previously served as OpenAI’s Vice President of Research. In 2020, Amodei, his sister Daniela Amodei, and other senior researchers departed from OpenAI due to disagreements with Altman and the board regarding the company’s direction.
The split reflected differing philosophies around AI safety, governance, and commercial strategy. Anthropic positions itself as a safety-focused AI lab, emphasising alignment and responsible development through its Claude model family.
OpenAI, meanwhile, has pursued rapid product deployment alongside safety research, bringing ChatGPT and enterprise AI tools to market at scale. The companies now compete directly in foundation models, enterprise partnerships, and government engagement, with both seeking leadership in the race toward artificial general intelligence (AGI).

--------------------
In a move aimed at addressing the growing marriage challenges faced by young farmers, Congress MLA HD Ranganath wrote o Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah seeking the introduction of a special incentive programme.
In a letter dated February 18, the Kunigal MLA urged the government to take up the matter in the forthcoming Assembly session. According to PTI, Ranganath said his constituency, Kunigal Taluk, is “mostly rural and depends heavily on farming". He noted that many young men continue to live in villages and earn their livelihood through agriculture, but “many women are not willing to marry them".
The MLA pointed out that several men remain unmarried even after turning 30 and are facing difficulties because of this social trend. Highlighting what he described as an urgent concern in rural areas, he wrote, “So, I request that in the next session, a special allowance and special status be given to women who marry men living in villages and working in agriculture."
Ranganath believes such a measure would help resolve the problems faced by young farmers in rural areas and encourage greater support for farming livelihoods. He has called for a structured discussion in the Assembly and the formulation of a policy at the earliest.
The proposal has triggered debate across Karnataka’s rural belt. While many see it as a positive intervention to strengthen agriculture socially and encourage young farmers, others are examining it from the perspective of social balance and economic feasibility.
There has been no official response yet from the Chief Minister’s office.
The challenge of delayed marriages among young men in agrarian communities has persisted for years in parts of the state. Whether financial incentives can reshape social attitudes remains to be seen, but the debate has once again brought the realities of rural life and agriculture into sharp focus.

French President Emmanuel Macron, during his three-day official visit to India, visited the Bangla Sahib Gurudwara in Delhi on Thursday.
Macron arrived in Mumbai, with his wife Brigitte Macron around midnight on Tuesday. During his visit, he attended the AI Impact Summit 2026 and held key bilateral talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday.
This is Macron’s fourth official visit to India since becoming the French President in 2017.
The French President on Thursday praised India’s tech growth and said that the country has built a digital system that no other country has. Applauding India’s digital payments system, Macron hailed New Delhi for creating a digital ecosystem that serves 1.4 billion people.
Speaking at the India AI Impact Summit 2026, Macron remarked, “India has achieved what no other country in the world has: a digital identity system covering 1.4 billion people, a payment network processing 20 billion transactions each month, and a health infrastructure that has issued 500 million digital health IDs."
“They call it the India Stack Open Interoperable Sovereign. That is what this summit is about. We are clearly at the beginning of a huge acceleration, and you perfectly described it during your interventions," he added during his keynote address.
On Wednesday, Macron stirred social media excitement by sharing a creative post featuring an AI-generated image with PM Modi, highlighting his enthusiasm for the ongoing AI Impact Summit 2026.
The message underscored the strengthening of the Franco-Indian partnership in AI, with initiatives such as the newly inaugurated Indo-French Centre for Artificial Intelligence in Health at AIIMS, in collaboration with Sorbonne University and the Paris Brain Institute.

--------------------
Thursday marked the fourth—and most high-profile—day of the AI Impact Summit 2026 being held at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi as global leaders such as United Nations chief Antonio Guterres and French President Emmanuel Macron graced the occasion, discussing the breakneck rise of a technology that’s igniting both investor excitement and serious unease in equal measure.
The stellar line-up included Prime Minister Narendra Modi; Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani; Sunil Bharti Mittal, Founder and Chairman, Bharti Enterprises; Shantanu Narayen, Chairman and CEO, Adobe; Dario Amodei, CEO, Anthropic; Rishad Premji, Executive Chairman, Wipro; and Sam Altman, CEO, OpenAI.
As PM Modi positioned India as a future global AI hub built on inclusion, ethics and “AI for all," urging that the technology empower humanity rather than concentrate power, Pichai described India as being on an “extraordinary trajectory" in AI adoption and talent and Ambani underscored massive private-sector investment bets on India’s AI future.
Here’s a look at who said what at the summit:
PM Narendra Modi: Unveiling his human-centric ‘MANAV’ vision for Artificial Intelligence at the AI Impact Summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi mentioned that the future of AI must be moral, sovereign and valid.
India’s vision for AI is encapsulated in the word MANAV, which means human. pic.twitter.com/4IqFOg7YPx— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) February 19, 2026
Decoding MANAV, the prime minister said the Hindi word for “human" is also an acronym that captures India’s five core principles for AI: Moral and ethical systems, Accountable governance, National sovereignty (especially data rights), Accessible and inclusive technology, and Valid, legitimate AI systems that people can trust.
Emphasising the need to place people at the heart of technological transformation, Modi called for making “skilling, reskilling, and lifelong learning a mass movement" to prepare societies for the rapidly evolving digital era.
“Artificial intelligence marks a transformative chapter in human history. India is not just a part of the AI revolution, but is leading and shaping it," he said in the presence of world leaders and CEOs of leading companies.
The prime minister also described AI as a historic transformation comparable to the invention of wireless communication. “When signals were first transmitted wirelessly, no one imagined that the entire world would one day be connected in real time. Artificial Intelligence is such a transformation of human history. What we are seeing today, what we are predicting, is just the beginning of its impact."
India sees the future in AI, said the prime minister, as he said he believes that any model that succeeds in India’s scale and diversity can be deployed anywhere in the world.
Mukesh Ambani: The Chairman and Managing Director of Reliance Industries Limited likened Artificial Intelligence to Akshay Patra from the Mahabharat, saying it was not just another technology.

“Artificial Intelligence is not just another technology. For the first time, humans are creating human-like systems that can learn, speak, analyse, move, and produce autonomously. AI is the mantra that powers every yantra or every machine and system to work faster, better, and smarter. I see AI as a modern-day Akshay Patra, the legendary vessel in the Mahabharat that provided endless nourishment to all. Likewise, AI offers limitless augmentation in knowledge, efficiency, and productivity."
Ambani said Reliance Jio will invest Rs 10 lakh crore over the next seven years towards AI, adding that Jio will also make AI widely affordable like it had done for internet data. “Jio has already started building AI applications for India’s most pressing challenges in inclusive development," he said.
Asked about AI snatching jobs, Ambani sounded positive, saying the new technology will not eliminate jobs but create high-skill employment opportunities. “My confidence is validated by an undeniable truth. In the coming decades, no country in the world can match India’s strength in demography, democracy, development, digital infrastructure, data generation, AI harvest. India is the world’s largest mobile data consumer. Nearly 1 billion internet users, data costs among the lowest globally. And in terms of quality, there is no difference between Delhi and the remotest Indian village," he said.
“Second, Aadhaar, 1.4 billion digital IDs. Third, UPI processes over 12 billion transactions monthly. Fourth, India ranks among the top three startup ecosystems with 100,000 startups and 100 plus unicorns. Fifth, India’s secure and inclusive digital public infrastructure stack is now being adopted by countries around the globe," he added, noting that social relevance, not momentary craze, should drive AI growth in India.
Antonio Guterres: The UN Secretary General, while praising the summit, cautioned that the future of Artificial Intelligence cannot be decided by a handful of countries or a few billionaires. “Done right, AI can advance sustainable development goals, accelerate breakthroughs in medicine, expand learning opportunities, strengthen food security, bolster climate action and disaster preparedness and improve access to vital public services," he said, adding: “But it can also deepen inequality, amplify bias and fuel harm. As AI’s energy and water demand soar, data centres and supply chains must switch to clean power."

Guterres went on to say: “The meeting in India has special meaning. It brings this conversation closer to the realities shaping much of the world. Because the future of AI cannot be decided by a handful of countries or left to the whims of a few billionaires."
Emmanuel Macron: Hailing India’s role in having “built what no other country can", the French President shared an example as he addressed the summit, saying: “10 years ago, a street vendor in Mumbai could not open a bank account. No address, no papers, no access… but today that same vendor accepts payments on his phone. That is not a technology story. That is a civilisational story."

As PM Modi sat in the audience, Macron said: “Here are the results. They call it the India Stack Open Interoperable Sovereign. That is what this summit is about. We are clearly at the beginning of a huge acceleration, and you [PM Modi] perfectly described it during your interventions…" Saying India had proved the world wrong, Macron added: “Ten years ago, the world said 1.4 billion people could not be brought into the digital economy. India proved them wrong. And today, some say AI is a game only the biggest can play…"
The French President added: “India and France, with Europe and our partners, those who believe in our approach… might have a different way… the future of AI will be built by those who combine innovation and responsibility, technology with humanity, and India and France will help shape this future."
Dario Amodei: The chief executive of the US artificial intelligence company Anthropic termed the “energy and ambition in this room and across India incredible" and said: “I’ve been spending the last few days meeting with Indian builders and enterprises, and the energy to build together here is palpable, unlike anywhere else".

Pointing to the company’s growing focus on India, he revealed that Anthropic has launched a new office in Bengaluru and named veteran business leader Irena Ghose, who brings three decades of experience building companies in India, as managing director of Anthropic India. He added that the company has secured fresh partnerships with leading Indian firms, including Infosys.
Amodei argued that society is already far down the path where just a few years are left before AI systems outperform the vast majority of people in most areas of thinking and expertise.
“There are only a small number of years for AI models to surpass the cognitive capabilities of most humans for most things. We’re increasingly close to what I’ve called a country of geniuses in a data centre, a set of AI agents that are more capable than most humans at most things and can coordinate at superhuman speed," he said.
Sam Altman: The OpenAI CEO praised India’s rapid adoption of Artificial Intelligence, saying: “It is amazing to be here, obviously the work happening in India and the adoption of AI is leading the world, and I can’t wait to see what goes next. This will be one of the biggest markets for AI in the world, and I think India will have a huge amount of influence."

Describing India as a potential “full-stack AI leader", he announced plans to expand the company’s footprint in the country. Linking AI’s evolution to India’s democratic context, Altman said, “The world’s largest democracy is well positioned to lead AI—not just to build it, but to shape it and decide what our future is going to look like."
He noted that many current roles, particularly those driven by cognitive repetition, data processing, and even parts of software development will be reshaped as AI systems become more capable. “More than 100 million people in India use ChatGPT every week, and more than a third of them are students." India, he added, is also the fastest-growing market globally for OpenAI.
Sundar Pichai: Praising India’s transformation, the Alphabet CEO said he is always struck by the pace of change in the country. Pichai, contrasting the change that Andhra Pradesh has undergone, said he once travelled by train through Visakhapatnam. “Today, Google is building a full-stack AI hub in the same city as part of its $15 billion infrastructure investment in India," he said. Pichai added it was this technology that “can improve lives at once on a generation scale and can improve billions of lives with AI".
Addressing the India AI Action Summit today was a profound personal honor.AI can improve billions of lives and solve some of the hardest problems in science.
The best outcomes of AI are not guaranteed. We must pursue AI boldly, approach it responsibly, and work together…
— Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) February 19, 2026
The Alphabet top boss, however, issued a warning regarding equitable access to technology, warning that the current digital divide must not become an “AI divide".
Announcing the “America-India Connect" initiative, Pichai described it as a comprehensive digital infrastructure and AI investment plan that could potentially reshape the future of global tech collaborations and propel India’s position in the global digital economy. The new initiative is an extension of Google’s earlier announced $15 billion five-year AI investment in India, which was focused on a mega AI hub in Visakhapatnam.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said that while some people fear the rise of Artificial Intelligence, India sees its future in it, pitching a message of technological optimism at the India AI Summit in Delhi. Follow Live Updates
Addressing the gathering at Bharat Mandapam, he said, “While some see fear in AI, others see the future. I can say with utmost pride that India finds its future in Artificial Intelligence," underlining the country’s forward-looking approach to the technology.
Highlighting the rapid pace of change in the digital era, the Prime Minister said, “AI is making machines intelligent, but more than that, it is increasing human capabilities manyfold. There is only one difference: this time, the speed is unprecedented, and the scale is also unexpected. Earlier, the impact of technology used to take decades to be visible. Today, the journey from machine learning to learning machines is faster, deeper and wider than ever."
Stressing the responsibility that comes with such transformative power, Modi drew parallels with nuclear technology and urged global reflection.
“We have to have a big vision and shoulder an equally big responsibility. Along with the present generation, we also have to worry about what form of AI we will hand over to the coming generations. Therefore, the real question today is not what Artificial Intelligence can do in the future. The question is, what do we do with Artificial Intelligence in the present? Such questions have come before humanity before. The most powerful example is nuclear power. We have seen its destruction and its positive contribution has also been seen," he observed.

Describing AI as a force that must be guided ethically, he said, “AI is a transformative power. If directionless, it becomes a disruption; if the right direction is found, it becomes a solution. How to make AI from machine-centric to human-centric, how to make it sensitive and responsive, this is the basic objective of this Global AI Impact Summit. The theme of this summit clearly reflects the perspective from which India views AI. Welfare of all, the happiness of all. This is our benchmark."
Calling for preparedness in the evolving job landscape, the Prime Minister added, “We must make skilling, reskilling, and lifelong learning a mass movement. The future of work will be inclusive, trusted, and human-centric. If we move forward together, artificial intelligence will elevate the potential of humanity."
Modi further underscored the need for global standards to address emerging digital threats such as deepfakes, calling for clear authentication mechanisms for AI-generated content.

TITLE: From 1930s CP Bookstore To Greater Noida Powerhouse: Galgotias Founder’s Net Worth Hits Rs...
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/suneel-galgotia-university-net-worth-delhi-connaught-place-bookstore-aa-ws-l-9917354.html
--------------------
When people talk about higher education in Delhi-NCR, Galgotias University is often part of the conversation. The university is known for its courses, campus life and large student base.
Right now, it is also in the news due to a controversy over a robot dog on campus. At the same time, many are looking at the journey of its founder, Suneel Galgotia, and how his family business grew over the decades.
How Suneel Galgotia Built The Institution
Galgotias University was set up in 2011 near the Yamuna Expressway in Greater Noida. It offers many undergraduate, postgraduate and PhD courses. Today, the university is led by Dhruv Galgotia, the son of Suneel Galgotia, who serves as CEO.
The roots of this large education group go back many years. The Galgotia family once owned a bookstore called ‘E.D. Galgotia & Sons’ in Connaught Place, Delhi. The shop was started in 1933 at B-17, Inner Circle, during the British Raj. It became a well-known place for books and stayed open for over 80 years.
Suneel Galgotia grew up around this bookstore. Later, when he took charge of the family business, he decided to expand. In the 1980s, he started Galgotia Publications. Over time, he moved further into the education sector.
In 2000, he began Galgotias Institute of Management and Technology (GIMT) with just 40 students. After that, he launched Galgotias College of Engineering and Technology. In 2011, he established Galgotias University in Greater Noida.
From Small Bookshop To Rs 3000 Crore Group
What began as a single bookstore slowly turned into a large education group. Today, reportedly more than 40,000 students study under the Galgotias banner. Students from over 40 countries come here for higher education, and alumni are spread across 96 nations.
As per reports, the family’s education business is estimated to be worth around Rs 3000 crore. Over the years, the group expanded step by step, adding new institutes and courses.
The original Galgotia Book Shop at B-17 is now marked as closed. Reports suggest it shut down around 2015 due to online competition and changes in the area. Another listing of E.D. Galgotia and Sons at No. 21 in Connaught Place reportedly remained on some directories with working hours (9:30 AM–6:30 PM, closed Sundays), but there is no clear update about its current operations.
Meanwhile, the Galgotias group now runs bookstores within its university campuses in Noida.

Mathura Junction railway station is widely known because Mathura is revered as the birthplace of Lord Krishna. However, the station is also famous for a remarkable railway distinction that sets it apart not only in India but across the world.
This junction is not the largest in terms of platforms, daily passenger footfall, or the number of trains. Yet it holds a unique position: seven railway lines branch out from here in seven different directions, a feature rarely found anywhere else globally.
From Mathura Junction, rail routes extend as follows:
Because of this network, Mathura connects not just the four cardinal directions but several important branch corridors as well.
More than 200 trains pass through the station every day, including Rajdhani, Shatabdi, Duronto, Superfast Express and local passenger trains.
The station itself has:
Although other countries have massive railway hubs, their directional connectivity differs.
No other junction in the world is connected in exactly seven distinct directions with direct train links to major parts of the country in the way Mathura Junction is. This unique geographical and operational feature makes it not just a spiritual landmark, but also a remarkable railway hub on the global map.

TITLE: 'What Kind Of Culture Are You Cultivating?': Supreme Court Slams 'Freebies' Ahead Of Elections
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/what-kind-of-culture-are-you-cultivating-supreme-court-slams-freebies-ahead-of-elections-9917184.html
--------------------
The Supreme Court on Thursday slammed the freebies culture ahead of the elections and said that it was high time to revisit such policies, as it hampers the country’s economic development. Further coming down heavily on the Tamil Nadu government in view of the distribution of ‘freebies’ before elections, the apex court questioned, “What kind of culture are you trying to cultivate?"
The top court’s comments came in regard to the Tamil Nadu Power Distribution Corporation Ltd’s plea, which proposed to provide free electricity to all, irrespective of the financial status of consumers.
A bench comprising Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi emphasised that while it is the state’s responsibility is to empower its people, giving out freebies from morning to night is not the way to build the nation. Most states are already running a revenue deficit, and such policies only exacerbate the situation, leaving no funds for development.
“Most of the states in the country are revenue-deficient states, and yet they are offering such freebies, overlooking development," the Bench said.
The bench said economic development of the nation gets hampered with this kind of largesse distribution and states should work to open avenues for employment instead of giving free food, cycles, electricity to all.
Following this, the Supreme Court issued a notice to the Centre and others on the plea of the DMK government-led power distribution firm, which proposes to provide free electricity. The power firm has challenged a rule of the Electricity Amendment Rules, 2024.
“What kind of culture are we developing in India? It is understandable that as part of the welfare measure, you want to provide to those who are incapable of paying the electricity charges. But without drawing a distinction between those who can afford and those who cannot, you start distributing. Will it not amount to an appeasing policy," CJI Surya Kant asked.
The Bench further raised questions on the sudden decision of the Tamil Nadu power firm to provide free electricity.
“The states should work to open avenues for employment. If you start giving free food from morning to evening, then free cycle, then free electricity, then who will work and then what will happen to the work culture," the CJI said.
The bench said states, instead of spending on development projects, do two jobs – paying salaries and distributing such largesse.

“It is believed that this Summit will play a crucial role in building a human-centric, sensitive global AI ecosystem. If we look at history, we see that humans have transformed every disruption into a new opportunity. Today, we have once again faced such an opportunity. Together, we have to transform this disruption into humanity’s biggest opportunity…" the Prime Minister said.
He said India believes AI will truly serve the global good only when it is shared openly and its codes remain accessible, making clear that the country does not fear the technology but views it as an opportunity and a blueprint for the future.
Addressing the India AI Impact Summit, Modi said, “We have to give an open sky to AI, but at the same time, we have to keep the reins in our hands."
Highlighting AI’s transformative potential, he said, “AI will make our systems smarter, more efficient and more impactful. It will open more opportunities for people to take up creative roles. It is a major opportunity for innovation, entrepreneurship and the creation of new industries," speaking at the event attended by world leaders and top industry CEOs.
“Some countries believe that AI should be developed in a confidential and closed manner. But India is different. We believe AI will truly serve the good of the world when it is shared and its codes are open. Only then will millions of young minds be able to improve it further," he said.
Modi added that the world today is divided between those who fear AI and those who see promise in it.
“I proudly and responsibly say that we do not see fear. India sees fortune in AI, India sees a future in AI. In AI, India sees opportunity and the blueprint of tomorrow," he asserted.

TITLE: Bihar Unveils ‘Game-Changing’ E-Voting At AI Summit 2026 — But Is India’s First-Of-Its-Kind System Fraud-Proof?
LINK: https://www.news18.com/india/bihar-unveils-indias-first-e-voting-system-powered-by-ai-at-impact-summit-2026-aa-ws-l-9916977.html
--------------------
Artificial intelligence (AI) has entered into public systems such as elections. At the India-AI Impact Summit 2026, one of the most talked-about presentations came from Bihar’s State Election Commission which showcased a mobile-based AI-driven remote voting system.
According to a report in NDTV, the commission is preparing to scale this model further and may expand it for use in the next Assembly elections.
Let’s take a look at this tech innovation in detail.
What Is Bihar’s AI-Based Remote Voting Model?
Bihar has introduced what it calls India’s first mobile-enabled remote voting platform. The system was first used during the 2025 urban local body elections and later presented at the summit as a model of digital governance.
The voting facility works through dedicated Android application, namely “e-Voting SECBHR" which is developed by the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) in collaboration with the State Election Commission.
The system is designed mainly for people who face difficulty reaching polling booths. This includes migrant workers living outside their home districts, students, senior citizens, pregnant women, persons with disabilities and those who are unwell.
How Does The System Work?
To vote remotely, users must download the official app on an Android phone. Accessing the app requires verification via OTP which will be sent on the mobile number provided.
It is followed by live selfie verification. The system uses AI-based facial recognition to match the selfie with the voter’s EPIC (Electors Photo Identity Card) ID photograph. Once identity checks are cleared, the voter can cast their vote through the app.
The system was first used live on June 28 last year during municipal by-elections.
What Security Measures Does The System Use?
As per the reports, platform has several layers of protection. These include AI facial recognition combined with liveness detection to ensure that a real person is present during verification.
Before the vote is recorded, OTP authentication and dual encryption are needed to be done. After the votes are casted, they are encrypted and stored using blockchain technology which is a tamper-resistant record.
The are audit trails similar to Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) as well. After polling ends, decryption is allowed only through secure digital signatures and multi-factor authentication by election authorities.
What Features Ensure That There Is No Tampering?
Blockchain plays a central role in protecting votes. Each vote is encrypted, anonymised and added as a new block in a decentralised ledger.
To alter a vote, someone would need to rewrite the entire blockchain across multiple distributed nodes which officials say is practically impossible due to computational limits.
Decryption keys are only known to election authorities. And they are used only after polling concludes.
How Is Voter Privacy Ensured?
Officials say the system has been designed to protect voter secrecy at every stage. Before a vote is recorded, it is encrypted and de-identified so that the identity of the voter is not linked to the choice made. The verification of identity happens at the beginning of the process through EPIC-linked facial recognition, liveness detection and OTP authentication. Once verification is complete, the vote is anonymised and stored on a blockchain-backed ledger using secure hashing and smart contracts.
For counting, decryption is tightly controlled. It requires the use of Returning Officers’ Digital Signature Certificates (DSCs), along with two-factor authentication and post-poll hash verification. Authorities say this ensures that results can be audited without revealing how any individual voted.
What Are The Potential Vulnerabilities?
Despite strong safety measures, some risks also loom. It allows up to two voters to register on a single device.
There are also fears about impersonation and misuse especially in households where one individual may influence another’s vote. Initial verification partly relies on voter ID entry and there have been reports of facial recognition failures in some attempts.
The system is currently available only on Android devices which excludes iOS users.
What Are The Privacy Concerns Related To The System?
This application collects personal data such as voter ID details, phone numbers, biometric information and device metadata.
Naturally, this raises a question: How long this data will be stored? And whether there are clear policies on third-party access?
How Has The System Been Evaluated So Far?
During the pilot phase, out of 14,804 attempts, 3,830 mock registrations were successfully completed.
Bihar officials maintain that EPIC-linked checks, encryption layers and post-poll decryption controls ensure that only genuine voters participate and that ballots remain secret.
But cybersecurity experts and organisations such as the Internet Freedom Foundation have urged caution. They recommend stronger oversight and regulatory clarity before expanding the system to full-scale Assembly elections.

--------------------
Pull up your socks or your score in the ‘Administrative Score Card’ will suffer — the Cabinet Secretariat has warned all ministries in a latest communique issued on February 12.
CNN-News18 has accessed an exclusive copy of the letter from the Cabinet Secretariat which reflects the frustration of the top office with ministries not finalising Cabinet notes in time and not updating a portal in real-time on the status of inter-ministerial consultations over a Cabinet proposal.
“Such delays on feeding dates on the IMC (Inter Ministerial Consultation) module will also result in showing huge pendency on the part of ministries/departments and will also affect score of the Ministries/Departments in the Administrative Score Card," the letter says.
A 100-point ‘Administrative Score Card’ was introduced by the Cabinet Secretariat last year to create a ‘healthy competition’ between ministries and rank them on performance on various parameters, a top government official told CNN-News18.
A key part of a Ministry’s job is to prepare Cabinet notes in a timely and professional manner.
“In spite of these clear instructions for time bound finalisation of Cabinet/Cabinet Committee notes, it has been observed that in many cases, this process is not being completed within the stipulated time-frame of 7/14/21 days, delaying the decision-making process for important policies, programmes, and schemes of the Government," the latest letter has highlighted.
The letter also said that while conveying these revised timelines earlier, it was stated that a new module, namely ‘Inter-Ministerial Consultations’ (IMC), has been activated for the purpose of monitoring and reviewing the delays and pendency occurring at various stages in finalisation of Cabinet and CCEA notes.
“For effective working of this Module, it is mandatory that Ministries and Departments concerned fill accurate dates at every stage of transmission of Cabinet and Cabinet Committee notes, such as date of dispatching hard copy of the note by the sponsoring Ministry or Department, date of receipt of the note by the recipient Ministry or Department, date of sending comments by the Ministry or Department consulted to the sponsoring one, date of receipt of comments by the sponsoring Ministry or Department, and dates of sending single note/final note by the sponsoring Ministry or Department to this Secretariat," the letter says.
“However, it has been observed that Ministries/Departments concerned are not entering dates related to transmission of notes on the module promptly and accurately, leading to difficulty in monitoring of delays in Inter-Ministerial consultation process," the Cabinet Secretariat says.

He reiterated that while AI is making machines intelligent, it is, more importantly, expanding human capabilities at an unprecedented speed and scale.
“When signals were first transmitted wirelessly, no one imagined that the entire world would one day be connected in real time. Artificial intelligence is such a transformation of human history. What we are seeing today, what we are predicting, is just the beginning of its impact," he said.
Welcoming delegates from across the world, Modi said India’s leadership in digital public infrastructure and its vast talent base make it a natural hub for AI innovation, adding that the summit being organised in India marks a significant moment for developing nations.

“They call it the India Stack Open Interoperable Sovereign. That is what this summit is about. We are clearly at the beginning of a huge acceleration, and you perfectly described it during your interventions," he added during his keynote address.
The French President further highlighted a story of a street vendor in Mumbai and said that about 10 years ago, the world told India that 1.4 billion people could not be brought into the digital economy, but the country proved everybody wrong.
“Today, some say AI is a game only the biggest can play. India, France, Europe, together with our partners, those who believe in our approach, companies, governments, investors, might have a different way," Macron said, adding, “The future of AI will be built by those who combine innovation and responsibility, technology with humanity, and India and France will help to shape this future together."
On Wednesday, Macron sparked buzz on social media after he shared a creative post featuring an AI-generated image alongside Prime Minister Narendra Modi, signalling excitement for the ongoing AI Impact Summit 2026.

The message underscored the strengthening of the Franco-Indian partnership in AI, with initiatives such as the newly inaugurated Indo-French Centre for Artificial Intelligence in Health at AIIMS, in collaboration with Sorbonne University and the Paris Brain Institute.

TITLE: Who Is Neha Singh? Galgotias Professor Goes ‘Open To Work’ On LinkedIn After AI Summit Robodog Mess

--------------------
Noida-based Galgotias University exited the India AI Impact Summit following a controversy over presenting a Chinese robodog as its own.
Professor Neha Singh, the main person at the centre of the debate, has updated her LinkedIn profile to “Open to Work."
Galgotias University Professor Changes LinkedIn Status
Neha’s LinkedIn bio highlighted her focus on communication skills.
“I have always believed that communication is more than just a skill — it is a force that shapes identity, builds confidence, and opens doors. With a natural flair for language, articulation, and stage presence, I have spent years helping individuals unlock their voice and express themselves with clarity and impact," she wrote.
“What sets me apart is not just my command of language, but the ability to connect, inspire, and elevate others through it. I enjoy working with learners at various stages — guiding them to communicate with confidence, professionalism, and authenticity," the bio further stated.
What Triggered The Controversy?
The issue began after a video clip caught widespread attention that showed Neha introducing a robotic dog named “Orion." In the clip, she described it as being “developed" by the university’s Centre of Excellence.
But it was later alleged that the machine was actually the Unitree Go2, an AI-powered robotic dog manufactured by China-based company Unitree Robotics and not an indigenously developed product.
This led to criticism that imported technology was being presented as homegrown innovation.
Professor Issues Clarification
Neha said there was no intention to mislead while responding to the controversy. She explained that the situation arose out of “enthusiasm and unclear expression" rather than a deliberate claim.
“The controversy happened because things may not have been expressed clearly. I take accountability that perhaps I did not communicate it properly, as it was done with a lot of energy and enthusiasm and very quickly," she said.
She added that her remarks were not articulated clearly and expressed regret over how they were interpreted.
Responding to the allegations, Singh clarified that the university had not built the robotic dog. She explained that the machine was purchased as part of the institution’s investment in artificial intelligence and was intended to serve as a practical learning tool for students, rather than an in-house innovation.

University’s Apology And Statement
Soon after, Galgotias University issued a clarification. The university said it had never claimed to have built the robotic dog and that the device was procured for academic and demonstration purposes.
“Let us be clear, Galgotias has not built this robodog, nor have we claimed to do so. What we are building are minds that will soon design, engineer and manufacture such technologies in Bharat," the statement read.
On Wednesday, the university again issued a statement where it apologised and stated that the representative at the pavilion had provided “factually incorrect information" in haste and without authorisation.
“We at Galgotias University wish to apologise profusely for the confusion created at the recent AI Summit. One of our representatives, manning the pavilion, was ill-informed. She was not aware of the technical origins of the product and, in her enthusiasm for being on camera, gave factually incorrect information even though she was not authorised to speak to the press," the educational institute stated.

Government’s Position
Following the allegations, the university was directed to vacate its stall at the summit venue in the national capital. Soon after, the electricity supply to the pavilion was disconnected, and staff, along with students, proceeded to dismantle and clear the exhibit.
IT Secretary S Krishnan said the government does not want any exhibitor to showcase items that are not their own. “We do not want such exhibits to continue," he said.
